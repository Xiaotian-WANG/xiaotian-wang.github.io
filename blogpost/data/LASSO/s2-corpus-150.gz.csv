Extended Lagrangian formulation of charge-constrained tight-binding molecular dynamics.,"The extended Lagrangian Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics formalism [Niklasson, Phys. Rev. Lett., 2008, 100, 123004] has been applied to a tight-binding model under the constraint of local charge neutrality to yield microcanonical trajectories with both precise, long-term energy conservation and a reduced number of self-consistent field optimizations at each time step. The extended Lagrangian molecular dynamics formalism restores time reversal symmetry in the propagation of the electronic degrees of freedom, and it enables the efficient and accurate self-consistent optimization of the chemical potential and atomwise potential energy shifts in the on-site elements of the tight-binding Hamiltonian that are required when enforcing local charge neutrality. These capabilities are illustrated with microcanonical molecular dynamics simulations of a small metallic cluster using an sd-valent tight-binding model for titanium. The effects of weak dissipation on the propagation of the auxiliary degrees of freedom for the chemical potential and on-site Hamiltonian matrix elements that is used to counteract the accumulation of numerical noise during trajectories was also investigated.",2015,Journal of chemical theory and computation
Optimal vision system design for characterization of apples using US/VIS/NIR spectroscopy data,"Quality monitoring of the food items by spectroscopy provides information in a large number of wavelengths including highly correlated and redundant information. Although increasing the information, the increase in the number of wavelengths causes the vision set-up to be more complex and expensive. In this paper, three sparse regression methods; lasso, elastic-net and fused lasso are employed for estimation of the chemical and physical characteristics of one apple cultivar using their high dimensional spectroscopic measurements. The use of sparse regression reduces the number of required wavelengths for prediction and thus, simplifies the required vision set-up. It is shown that, considering a tradeoff between the number of selected bands and the corresponding validation performance during the training step can result in a significant reduction in the number of bands at a small price in the test performance. Furthermore, appropriate regression methods for different number of bands and spectrophotometer design are determined.",2013,"2013 20th International Conference on Systems, Signals and Image Processing (IWSSIP)"
Signals and signal processing for the electrophysiologist: part I: electrogram acquisition.,"Successful mapping and ablation in the electrophysiology (EP) laboratory is critically dependent on acquiring multiple, low-amplitude, intracardiac signals in the presence of numerous sources of electric noise and interference and displaying these signals in an uncomplicated and clinically relevant fashion, with minimal artifact. This represents a significant engineering challenge and, in a real-life EP laboratory, is not always successful. Understanding the challenges and reasons for failure and knowing how to optimize the electronic data acquisition system in the EP laboratory can go a long way toward ensuring smooth procedures and good outcomes.

In this 2-part review, we will present information on the layout of a typical EP laboratory, with emphasis on common approaches to amplification and filtering of ECG and intracardiac signals, sources of noise and interference with techniques to minimize them, and also discuss in detail the subtleties of unipolar/bipolar signals and their clinical relevance.

In all of the electrogram illustrations, the following abbreviations are used:

P1 ART indicates arterial pressure tracing; II and V1, surface ECG leads; RVA and RVAd, proximal and distal right ventricular apex signals; HRA and HRAd, high right atrial catheter proximal and distal signals; His4 to His1, His bundle signals from an octapolar catheter, with His1 being most distal; Lasso 1,2 to Lasso 10,1, circular catheter signals; ABL and ABLd, proximal and distal ablation catheter signals; and CS 19,20 to CS 1,2, coronary sinus catheter signals, with CS 1,2 being most distal.

### High-Yield Electronics

The small voltages and currents that constitute biopotentials must be manipulated and presented in an easily understandable manner to the electrophysiologist. This involves amplification and filtering of the signals. Signals of interest may be manipulated in the form of voltage or current. A limited but effective analogy is to consider voltage as being the equivalent of water pressure. If a â€¦",2011,Circulation. Arrhythmia and electrophysiology
On the total variation regularized estimator over the branched path graph,"We generalize to tree graphs obtained by connecting path graphs an oracle result obtained for the Fused Lasso over the path graph. Moreover we show that it is possible to substitute in the oracle inequality the minimum distance between jumps by the harmonic mean of the distances between jumps. In doing so we prove a lower bound on the compatibility constant for the total variation penalty. Our analysis leverages insights obtained for the path graph with one branch to understand the case of more general tree graphs. As a side result, we get insights into the irrepresentable condition for the branched path graph.",2018,arXiv: Statistics Theory
B Selected variables in KPI data analysis,"Regularization plays a critical role in modern statistical research, especially in high dimensional variable selection problems. Existing Bayesian methods usually assume independence between variables a priori. In this article, we propose a novel Bayesian approach, which explicitly models the dependence structure through a graph Laplacian matrix. We also generalize the graph Laplacian to allow both positively and negatively correlated variables. A prior distribution for the graph Laplacian is then proposed, which allows conjugacy and thereby greatly simplifies the computation. We show that the proposed Bayesian model leads to proper posterior distribution. We also connect our method with some existing regularization methods, such as Elastic Net, Lasso, OSCAR and Ridge regression. For posterior computation, we develop an efficient MCMC method based on parameter augmentation. Finally, we demonstrate the method through simulation studies and real data analysis.",2010,
Serum levels of fibroblast growth factor-2 distinguish Takayasu arteritis from giant cell arteritis independent of age at diagnosis,"Takayasu arteritis (TAK) and giant cell arteritis (GCA) are two major variants of large vessel vasculitis, and age is a major factor in their differential diagnosis. We sought to determine whether the two diseases exist on the same spectrum. We compared the serum levels of multiple cytokines and chemokines in 25 patients with TAK, 20 patients with GCA, and sex- and age-matched healthy donors for either condition (HD-TAK and HD-GCA). To evaluate the effects of age on the levels of cytokines and chemokines, we performed multiple logistic regression analysis using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method. The levels of IL-1RA, IL-10, GM-CSF, G-CSF, FGF-2, eotaxin, and IP-10 were significantly different between TAK and GCA, but no differences were found in the levels of IL-6, IL-12(p40), IL-17, IFN-Î³, and TNF-Î±. Significant differences in the levels of IL-1RA, IL-10, GM-CSF, eotaxin, and IP-10 were observed between the HD-TAK and HD-GCA groups. Multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that only FGF-2 and IP-10 could significantly distinguish the diseases when added to age. Multiple logistic analysis using factors selected by the LASSO method revealed that FGF-2 was the only significant factor to distinguish the diseases when added to age. Among numerous cytokines and chemokines analyzed, only FGF-2 could be used together with age at diagnosis to differentiate TAK and GCA. Our results suggested the importance of considering the effects of age on serum cytokines.",2019,Scientific Reports
MÃ¨todes estadÃ­stics per al refinament del diagnÃ²stic dels sÃ­ndromes limfoproliferatius de cÃ¨l.lula B,"Els sindromes limfoproliferatius cronics de celâ€¢lula B (B-CLPD) engloben diverses entitats heterogenies de tumors hematologics. Aproximadament un 15% dels casos no es poden classificar correctament en cap entitat mitjancant els criteris diagnostics convencionals. Aquests casos sense un diagnostic definitiu es consideren B-CLPD, not otherwise specified (B-CLPD, NOS). Determinades informacions moleculars, com son l'expressio genica i les alteracions en el material genetic, podrien contenir trets especifics de cada entitat. La tecnologia dels microarrays permet mesurar l'expressio de milers de gens o la quantitat de material genetic en milers de regions de manera simultania, el qual facilita la identificacio de biomarcadors candidats. El primer objectiu d'aquesta tesi ha sigut el de construir un predictor, basat en informacio de dues plataformes de microarrays diferents (expressio i copy-number), capac de classificar les diferents entitats de B-CLPD. Per tal de construir-lo, s'ha utilitzat una cohort de 159 pacients leucemics distribuits en nou entitats de B-CLPD diferents. Degut al cost economic d'utilitzar dues plataformes, ha sigut molt important avaluar l'increment que suposa en la precisio del predictor utilitzar-ne dues en comptes d'una. La metodologia utilitzada ha permes concloure que l'expressio genica, com a font unica, obte precisions similars a les de combinar les dues fonts. El segon objectiu ha sigut construir un predictor utilitzant nomes la font d'expressio. Per tal de minimitzar el risc d'overfitting, la metodologia proposada ha permes obtenir un predictor senzill i facil de contrastar amb coneixements biologics previs. Aquest predictor ha inclos 55 gens i ha sigut capac de distingir sis de les nou entitats. Les tres restants s'han categoritzat com Miscellaneous. Els predictors basats en tecnologies d'alt rendiment, com son els microarrays, son dificils d'implementar a la rutina clinica. Existeixen tecniques mes simples, com la quantitative PCR (qPCR), pero que tenen l'inconvenient de nomes poder mesurar uns pocs gens simultaniament. El primer pas per tal de construir un predictor basat en qPCR es seleccionar un petit subconjunt de gens a mesurar en aquesta tecnologia, on la seleccio es fa en base a la informacio obtinguda dels microarrays. Aquest canvi de tecnologia te dos inconvenients: i) el nombre de gens a traslladar a qPCR es limitat, i ii) la correlacio entre les dues tecnologies no es perfecta, provocant que les capacitats predictives observades en els microarrays no sempre es reprodueixin en qPCR. El tercer objectiu d'aquesta tesi ha sigut seleccionar un subconjunt de 35 gens a traslladar a qPCR, on la metodologia proposada ha tingut en compte tres rellevancies (biologica, estadistica i multivariant) dels gens per tal de maximitzar la reproductibilitat de la informacio al canviar de plataforma. Degut a que la metodologia que s'ha utilitzat per a la seleccio de gens es complexa d'aplicar a la practica, s'ha proposat lassoVoting, un metode mes senzill i que s'ha demostrat que es adequat quan l'estructura de correlacio esta ordenada. Amb els 35 gens seleccionats, s'ha utilitzat una mostra de 44 pacients dels 159 inicials per construir el predictor en qPCR. Aquest predictor ha inclos 8 gens i s'ha provat exitosament en una cohort de validacio independent de 63 pacients. Degut a la incapacitat de l'expressio genica per distingir les tres entitats Miscellaneous, el quart objectiu d'aquesta tesi ha sigut avaluar si altres trets moleculars i genetics publicats en la literatura permeten distingir-les. S'han identificat diversos trets que, un cop s'han descartat les altres sis entitats en base a l'expressio genica, les poden discriminar. Finalment, en una cohort de 64 B-CLPD, NOS, s'han classificat a una entitat especifica 29 casos utilitzant nomes l'expressio genica i 14 utilitzant l'expressio i trets moleculars/genetics.

Radiomics analysis of multiparametric MRI for the preoperative evaluation of pathological grade in bladder cancer tumors,"ObjectivesTo develop and validate an MRI-based radiomics strategy for the preoperative estimation of pathological grade in bladder cancer (BCa) tumors.MethodsA primary cohort of 70 patients (31 high-grade BCa and 39 low-grade BCa) with BCa were retrospectively enrolled. Three sets of radiomics features were separately extracted from tumor volumes on T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps. Two sets of multimodal features were separately generated by the maxout and concatenation of the aboveÂ mentioned single-modality features. Each feature set was subjected to a two-sample t test and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm for feature selection. Multivariable logistic regression (LR) analysis was used to obtain five corresponding radiomics models. The diagnostic abilities of the radiomics models were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and compared using the DeLong test. Validation was performed on a time-independent cohort containing 30 consecutive patients.ResultsThe areas under the ROC curves (AUCs) of single-modality T2WI, DWI, and ADC models in the training cohort were 0.7933 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.7471â€“0.8396), 0.8083 (95% CI 0.7565â€“0.8601), and 0.8350 (95% CI 0.7924â€“0.8776), respectively. Both multimodality models achieved higher AUCs (maxout 0.9233, 95% CI 0.9001â€“0.9466; concatenation 0.9233, 95% CI 0.9001â€“0.9466) than single-modality models. The AUCs of the maxout and concatenation models in the validation cohort were 0.9186 and 0.9276, respectively.ConclusionsThe MRI-based multiparametric radiomics approach has the potential to be used as a noninvasive imaging tool for preoperative grading of BCa tumors. Multicenter validation is needed to acquire high-level evidence for its clinical application.Key Pointsâ€¢ Multiparametric MRI may help in the preoperative grading of BCa tumors.â€¢ The Joint_Model established from T2WI, DWI, and ADC feature subsets demonstrated a high diagnostic accuracy for preoperative prediction of pathological grade in BCa tumors.â€¢ The radiomics approach has the potential to preoperatively assess tumor grades in BCa and avoid subjectivity.",2019,European Radiology
Multivariate pattern analysis strategies in detection of remitted major depressive disorder using resting state functional connectivity,"Understanding abnormal resting-state functional connectivity of distributed brain networks may aid in probing and targeting mechanisms involved in major depressive disorder (MDD). To date, few studies have used resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) to attempt to discriminate individuals with MDD from individuals without MDD, and to our knowledge no investigations have examined a remitted (r) population. In this study, we examined the efficiency of support vector machine (SVM) classifier to successfully discriminate rMDD individuals from healthy controls (HCs) in a narrow early-adult age range. We empirically evaluated four feature selection methods including multivariate Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and Elastic Net feature selection algorithms. Our results showed that SVM classification with Elastic Net feature selection achieved the highest classification accuracy of 76.1% (sensitivity of 81.5% and specificity of 68.9%) by leave-one-out cross-validation across subjects from a dataset consisting of 38 rMDD individuals and 29 healthy controls. The highest discriminating functional connections were between the left amygdala, left posterior cingulate cortex, bilateral dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex, and right ventral striatum. These appear to be key nodes in the etiopathophysiology of MDD, within and between default mode, salience and cognitive control networks. This technique demonstrates early promise for using rs-fMRI connectivity as a putative neurobiological marker capable of distinguishing between individuals with and without rMDD. These methods may be extended to periods of risk prior to illness onset, thereby allowing for earlier diagnosis, prevention, and intervention.",2017,NeuroImage : Clinical
Markov Random Field priors to model a super-graph linking different graphical models,"In this article, we propose a new class of priors for Bayesian inference with multiple Gaussian graphical models. We introduce fully Bayesian treatments of two popular procedures, the group graphical lasso and the fused graphical lasso, and extend them to a continuous spike-and-slab framework to allow self-adaptive shrinkage and model selection simultaneously. We develop an EM algorithm that performs fast and dynamic explorations of posterior modes. Our approach selects sparse models efficiently with substantially smaller bias than would be induced by alternative regularization procedures. The performance of the proposed methods are demonstrated through simulation and two real data examples.",2018,
Bayesian shrinkage,"Penalized regression methods, such as L1 regularization, are routinely used in high-dimensional applications, and there is a rich literature on optimality p roperties under sparsity assumptions. In the Bayesian paradigm, sparsity is routinely induced throu gh two-component mixture priors having a probability mass at zero, but such priors encounter daunti ng computational problems in high dimensions. This has motivated an amazing variety of contin uous shrinkage priors, which can be expressed as global-local scale mixtures of Gaussians, fac ilitating computation. In sharp contrast to the corresponding frequentist literature, very little i s known about the properties of such priors. Focusing on a broad class of shrinkage priors, we provide pre cise results on prior and posterior concentration. Interestingly, we demonstrate that most co mm nly used shrinkage priors, including the Bayesian Lasso, are suboptimal in high-dimensional set tings. A new class of Dirichlet Laplace (DL) priors are proposed, which are optimal and lead to effici nt posterior computation exploiting results from normalized random measure theory. Finite samp le performance of Dirichlet Laplace priors relative to alternatives is assessed in simulations .",2012,
A directed learning strategy integrating multiple omic data improves genomic prediction,"Genomic prediction (GP) aims to construct a statistical model for predicting phenotypes using genome-wide markers and is a promising strategy for accelerating molecular plant breeding. However, current progress of phenotype prediction using genomic data alone has reached a bottleneck, and previous studies on transcriptomic and metabolomic predictions ignored genomic information. Here, we designed a novel strategy of GP called multilayered least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (MLLASSO) by integrating multiple omic data into a single model that iteratively learns three layers of genetic features (GFs) supervised by observed transcriptome and metabolome. Significantly, MLLASSO learns higher order information of gene interactions, which enables us to achieve a significant improvement of predictability of yield in rice from 0.1588 (GP alone) to 0.2451 (MLLASSO). In the prediction of the first two layers, some genes were found to be genetically predictable genes (GPGs) as their expressions were accurately predicted with genetic markers. Interestingly, we made three dramatic discoveries for the GPGs: (i) GPGs are good predictors for highly complex traits like yield; (ii) GPGs are mostly eQTL genes (cis or trans); and (iii) trait-related transcriptional factor families are enriched in GPGs. These findings support the notion that learned GFs not only are good predictors for traits but also have specific biological implications regarding regulation of gene expressions. To differentiate the new method from conventional GP models, we called MLLASSO a directed learning strategy supervised by intermediate omic data. This new prediction model appears to be more reliable and more robust than conventional GP models.",2019,Plant Biotechnology Journal
Some Platyhelminth Parasites of Sirens (Amphibia: Sirenidae) from North America,"A new genus and species of digenean and a new species of cestode are described and a previously described species of digenean reported for the first time from Siren intermedia from Illinois. A new genus is proposed for a previously described digenean, and another known species of digenean reported from Siren lacertina in Florida. Progorgodera foliata from S. intermedia has a foliate hindbody characteristic of members of Phyllodistomum and multiple testes arranged in 2 longitudinal rows characteristic of members of Gorgodera. Ophiotaenia sireni from the same host resembles 0. filaroides in number of testes, 0. amphiumae and 0. alternans in number of uterine branches, and 0. grandis and 0. marenzelleri in scolex size. Allassostomoides louisianaensis is reported for the first time from Siren intermedia. The new genus Cephalogonimoides is proposed for Cephalogonimus sireni from Siren lacertina, which differs from members of Cephalogonimus by having symmetrical testes, ceca extending to the posterior end of the body, an acetabulum twice as large as the oral sucker, and a muscular prepharynx; and by lacking a seminal receptacle. Telorchis stunkardi is reported from S. lacertina for the first time. The amphibian genus Siren L. is represented in North America by two species, Siren lacertina L. and S. intermedia LeConte. Five species of adult platyhelminths have been reported from S. lacertina: Cercorchis (= Telorchis) sireni Zeliff 1937, Stomatrema guberleti Byrd 1937, Gorgodera minima Cort 1911, Cephalogonimus sireni Premvati 1969, and Ophiotaenia sp. (Zeliff, 1937; Walton, 1958; Premvati, 1969; Loftin, 1960). Manter (1938) reported Cephalogonimus amphiumae Chandler 1923 from Siren sp. To date, no adult platyhelminths have been reported from Siren intermedia. From 1970 to 1975 adult platyhelminths were collected from Siren intermedia captured in southern Illinois. All specimens were fixed with AFA. Cestodes were first relaxed in cold tap water; digeneans were flattened with slight coverslip pressure. Worms were stained with Mayer's hematoxylin and mounted in Canada balsam. Measurements are in micrometers unless otherwise stated; figures were drawn with the aid of a drawing tube.",1976,Journal of Parasitology

Empirical Bayes analysis of spike and slab posterior distributions,"In the sparse normal means model, convergence of the Bayesian posterior distribution associated to spike and slab prior distributions is considered. The key sparsity hyperparameter is calibrated via marginal maximum likelihood empirical Bayes. The plug-in posterior squared-$L^2$ norm is shown to converge at the minimax rate for the euclidean norm for appropriate choices of spike and slab distributions. Possible choices include standard spike and slab with heavy tailed slab, and the spike and slab LASSO of Rockov\'a and George with heavy tailed slab. Surprisingly, the popular Laplace slab is shown to lead to a suboptimal rate for the full empirical Bayes posterior. This provides a striking example where convergence of aspects of the empirical Bayes posterior does not entail convergence of the full empirical Bayes posterior itself.",2018,arXiv: Statistics Theory
"Using in situ ultravioletâ€visual spectroscopy to measure nitrogen, carbon, phosphorus, and suspended solids concentrations at a high frequency in a brackish tidal marsh","The collection of high frequency water quality data are key to making the next leap in hydrological and biogeochemical sciences. Commercially available in situ ultraviolet-visual (UV-Vis) spectrometers make possible the long-term collection of absorption spectra multiple times per hour. This technology has proven useful for measuring nitrate, dissolved organic carbon, and total suspended solids in many environments, but has not been tested in tidal marsh conditions where upstream freshwater mixes with estuarine waters, resulting in rapid changes in concentrations and salinity. These three parameters encompass only a portion of the nutrients that are of interest in these systems. To test the potential of spectroscopy to measure these and other nutrient concentrations, spectrometers were installed in a constructed brackish tidal marsh and absorbance spectra were compared to lab analyses for coinciding discrete samples. Variable selection techniques, including partial least squares regression, lasso regression, and stepwise regression, were used to develop models with which nitrate, total kjeldahl nitrogen, dissolved organic carbon, phosphate, total phosphorus, total suspended solids, and salinity in brackish marsh waters can be predicted from UV-Vis spectrometer measurements. Significant relationships between the absorption spectra and the laboratory measured concentrations were observed for all of the parameters. Phosphate and total phosphorus were the only nutrients which had R2 values less than 0.86 for their best calibrations. This study shows the potential to collect multiple water quality parameters at a high frequency in brackish waters using in situ spectrometers and gives the tools to replicate this analysis in all environments.",2014,Limnology and Oceanography-methods
The condensed tannins (Proanthocyanidins) in seagrasses,"In a survey of 29 species in the 12 seagrass genera, those in the Potamogetonaceae that characteristically have tannin cells in the leaves (Posidonioideae: Posidonia; Cymodoceoideae: Halodule, Syringodium, Cymodocea, Thalassodendron, Amphibolis) contained compounds with the Rf values and color reactions typical of condensed tannins. Species in the Potamogetonaceae that are not characterized by tannin cells in the leaves (Zosteroideae: Zostera, Phyllospadix, Heterozostera) contained compounds with the Rf values associated with condensed tannins but without the typical staining reactions. Two of the three genera in the Hydrocharitaceae (Enhalus, Thalassia) are characterized by tannin cells in the leaves and contain compounds with the Rf values of condensed tannins but only some of the typical staining reactions. The third genus, Halophila, lacks tannin cells in the leaves and contains compounds with the Rf values of condensed tannins without the typical staining reactions. The role of condensed tannins as feeding deterrents because of their protein-binding properties has been well established for many land plants, but their role in seagrass biology has not been assessed fully.",1984,Aquatic Botany
Exact Calabi-Yau categories and q-intersection numbers,"An exact Calabi-Yau structure, originally introduced by Keller, is a special kind of smooth Calabi-Yau structures in the sense of Kontsevich-Vlassopoulos. For a Weinstein manifold $M$, the existence of an exact Calabi-Yau structure on its wrapped Fukaya category $\mathcal{W}(M)$ imposes strong restrictions on its symplectic topology. Under the cyclic open-closed map constructed by Ganatra, an exact Calabi-Yau structure on $\mathcal{W}(M)$ induces a class $\tilde{b}$ in the degree one equivariant symplectic cohomology $\mathit{SH}_{S^1}^1(M)$. Using $\tilde{b}$ one can define a version of refined intersection numbers between $\tilde{b}$-equivariant objects of the compact Fukaya category $\mathcal{F}(M)$, which reduces to the $q$-intersection numbers introduced by Seidel-Solomon if $\tilde{b}$ is induced by a quasi-dilation in the degree one symplectic cohomology via the erasing map $\mathit{SH}^1(M)\rightarrow\mathit{SH}_{S^1}^1(M)$. This enables us to show that any Weinstein manifold with exact Calabi-Yau $\mathcal{W}(M)$ contains only finitely many disjoint Lagrangian spheres. We prove that the wrapped Fukaya category of the Milnor fiber of a 3-fold triple point is exact Calabi-Yau despite the fact that it does not admit a quasi-dilation.",2019,arXiv: Symplectic Geometry
Boosting part-sense multi-feature learners toward effective object detection,"AdaBoost has been applied to object detection to construct the detectors with high performance of discrimination and generalization by single-feature learner. However, the poor discriminative power of extremely weak single-feature learners limits its application for general object detection. In this paper, we propose a novel comprehensive learner design mechanism toward effective object detection in terms of both discrimination and generalization abilities. Firstly, the part-sense multi-feature learners are designed to linearly combine the multiple local features to improve the descriptive and discriminative capacity of the learner. Secondly, we formulate the feature selection in part-sense multi-feature learner as a weighted LASSO regression. Using Least Angle Regression (LARS) method, our approach can choose features adaptively, efficiently and as few as possible to guarantee generalization performance. Finally, a robust L1-regularized gradient boosting is proposed to integrate our part-sense sparse features learner into an object classifier. Extensive experiments and comparisons on the face dataset and the human dataset show the proposed approach outperforms the traditional single-feature learner and other multi-feature learners in discriminative and generalization abilities.",2011,Comput.

High-Dimensional Feature Selection by Feature-Wise Non-Linear Lasso,"The goal of supervised feature selection is to find a subset of input features that are responsible for predicting output values. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) allows computationally efficient feature selection based on linear dependency between input features and output values. In this paper, we consider a feature-wise kernelized Lasso for capturing non-linear input-output dependency. We first show that, with particular choices of kernel functions, non-redundant features with strong statistical dependence on output values can be found in terms of kernel-based independence measures. We then show that the globally optimal solution can be efficiently computed; this makes the approach scalable to high-dimensional problems. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through feature selection experiments with thousands of features.",2012,ArXiv
A Data Mining Approach Identified Salivary Biomarkers That Discriminate between Two Obesity Measures,"Background
A key mechanism of obesity involves dysregulation of metabolic and inflammatory markers. This study aimed to identify salivary biomarkers and other factors associated with obesity using an ensemble data mining approach.


Methods
For a random cohort of over 700 subjects from 8137 Kuwait children (10.00â€‰Â±â€‰0.67â€‰years), four data mining methods were applied to identify important variables associated with obesity, including logistic regression by lasso regularization (Lasso), multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS), random forests (RF), and boosting classification trees (BT). Each algorithm generated a variable importance rank list, based on an internal cross-validation procedure. An aggregated importance ranking was constructed by averaging the rank ordering of variables from individual list, weighted by the classification performance of respective models. Subsequently, the subset of top-ranking variables that were identified with at least three algorithms was evaluated by classification performance using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis with bootstrap percentile resampling.


Results
Obesity was defined either by the waist circumference (OBW) or by the body mass index (BMI) (OBWHO). We identified C-reactive protein (CRP), insulin, leptin, adiponectin, as salivary biomarkers associated with OBW, plus a clinical feature fitness level. A similar set of biomarkers was identified for OBWHO, but not including leptin. Tree-based clustering analysis revealed patterns that were significantly different between the OBW and OBWHO subjects.


Conclusion
A data mining approach based on multiple algorithms is useful for identifying factors associated with phenotypes, especially in cases where relationships are not salient, and a consensus from multiple methods can help produce a more generalizable subset of features. In this case, we have demonstrated that evaluation using the waist circumference includes association with high levels of salivary leptin, which is not seen with evaluation by BMI.",2019,Journal of Obesity
Second outburst phase of McNeil's nebula (V1647 Orionis),"Abstract. The FU Ori/EX Ori phenomenon represents a rareand not yet fully understood phase of the early evolution of low massstars.

A Unified Successive Pseudo-Convex Approximation Framework,"In this paper, we propose a successive pseudo-convex approximation algorithm to efficiently compute stationary points for a large class of possibly nonconvex optimization problems. The stationary points are obtained by solving a sequence of successively refined approximate problems, each of which is much easier to solve than the original problem. To achieve convergence, the approximate problem only needs to exhibit a weak form of convexity, namely, pseudo-convexity. We show that the proposed framework not only includes as special cases a number of existing methods, for example, the gradient method and the Jacobi algorithm, but also leads to new algorithms which enjoy easier implementation and faster convergence speed. We also propose a novel line search method for nondifferentiable optimization problems, which is carried out over a properly constructed differentiable function with the benefit of a simplified implementation as compared to state-of-the-art line search techniques that directly operate on the original nondifferentiable objective function. The advantages of the proposed algorithm are shown, both theoretically and numerically, by several example applications, namely, MIMO broadcast channel capacity computation, energy efficiency maximization in massive MIMO systems and LASSO in sparse signal recovery.",2017,
Separation of Human Natural Killer Cell,"Subsets of human natural killer (NK) cells were identified that differed in the capacity to be activated by interferon (IFN) or the IFN-inducer, polyriboinosinic:polyribocytidylic acid [poly(I):poly(C)|. These subsets, which represented effectors of both spontaneous and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, were physically separable on the basis of cell buoyant density changes induced by exposure of lymphocytes to hyperosmolar FicollHypaque solutions or by centrifugaron of lymphocytes through hyperosmolar (350 mOs/kg) Percoll gradients. Hyperosmolar conditions per se altered neither cell viability, NK cell cytolytic activity, nor the capacity of NK cells in unseparated lymphocyte preparations to be activated by IFN. IFN-unresponsive NK cells, separated by centrifugation through a 350 mOs/kg Percoll layer of 1.069-1.070 g/cm3 specific density, constituted 20 Â± 4% of all active NK cells identified at the single cell level and, per active NK cell, killed comparably to unstimulated IFN-responsive NK cells in 51Cr release assays. Thus, the IFN-unresponsive phenotype was probably not attributable to NK cells that were in an activated state prior to IFN treatment. Surface marker analysis of active NK cells at the single cell level identified comparable proportions in each subfraction to be of the OKMl+, OKT8% or OKT11* phenotypes and few, if any, in either subfraction to be of the OKT3+ phenotype. The human IFN-unresponsive NK cell phenotype, in contrast to the corresponding phenotype in the mouse, was therefore not linked to expression of T-cellassociated membrane differentiation antigens.",1986,
Short and long-term impact of urban gardening on soil organic carbon fractions in Lixisols (Burkina Faso),"Abstract In sub-Saharan Africa, market gardening relies on the intensive use of organic amendments, but little is known about the impact of these practices on soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics. Recent studies have demonstrated that a better understanding of carbon dynamics can be achieved by considering different carbon pools. Here we used a simple method of physical SOC fractionation to assess the impact of market gardening practices on the evolution of total SOC and its stable and labile sub-fractions over a period of several decades. The study was conducted at the Kuinima market gardening zone in Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina Faso). Composite soil samples (0â€“15Â cm depth) were collected from a chronosequence of 69 fields including control plots and plots farmed for more than 50Â years. Samples were wet sieved at 20Â Âµm after agitation or sonication to assess carbon content in the fine (i.e. stable) and coarse fractions. Our results show an asymptotic increase in total carbon content, from 9Â gÂ CÂ kgâˆ’1 for uncultivated control plots to 28Â gÂ CÂ kgâˆ’1 for plots cultivated for more than 50Â years. This increase tends to stabilize after 30Â years. A similar trend is observed for C content in the coarse fractionÂ >Â 20Â Âµm. In contrast, carbon content in the fraction",2020,Geoderma
Graph Topological Aspects of Granger Causal Network Learning,"We study Granger causality in the context of wide-sense stationary time series, where our focus is on the topological aspects of the underlying causality graph. We establish sufficient conditions (in particular, we develop the notion of a ""strongly causal"" graph topology) under which the true causality graph can be recovered via pairwise causality testing alone, and provide examples from the gene regulatory network literature suggesting that our concept of a strongly causal graph may be applicable to this field. We implement and detail finite-sample heuristics derived from our theory, and establish through simulation the efficiency gains (both statistical and computational) which can be obtained (in comparison to LASSO-type algorithms) when structural assumptions are met.",2019,arXiv: Statistics Theory
The Kernel Interaction Trick: Fast Bayesian Discovery of Pairwise Interactions in High Dimensions,"Discovering interaction effects on a response of interest is a fundamental problem faced in biology, medicine, economics, and many other scientific disciplines. In theory, Bayesian methods for discovering pairwise interactions enjoy many benefits such as coherent uncertainty quantification, the ability to incorporate background knowledge, and desirable shrinkage properties. In practice, however, Bayesian methods are often computationally intractable for even moderate-dimensional problems. Our key insight is that many hierarchical models of practical interest admit a particular Gaussian process (GP) representation; the GP allows us to capture the posterior with a vector of O(p) kernel hyper-parameters rather than O(p^2) interactions and main effects. With the implicit representation, we can run Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) over model hyper-parameters in time and memory linear in p per iteration. We focus on sparsity-inducing models and show on datasets with a variety of covariate behaviors that our method: (1) reduces runtime by orders of magnitude over naive applications of MCMC, (2) provides lower Type I and Type II error relative to state-of-the-art LASSO-based approaches, and (3) offers improved computational scaling in high dimensions relative to existing Bayesian and LASSO-based approaches.",2019,ArXiv
A GA-Based Approach for Building Regularized Sparse Polynomial Models for Wind Turbine Power Curves,"In this paper, the classical polynomial model for wind turbines power curve estimation is revisited aiming at an automatic and parsimonious design. In this regard, using genetic algorithms we introduce a methodoloy for estimating a suitable order for the polynomial as well its relevant terms. The proposed methodology is compared with the state of the art in estimating the power curve of wind turbines, such as logistic models (with 4 and 5 parameters), artificial neural networks and weighted polynomial regression. We also show that the proposed approach performs better than the standard LASSO approach for building regularized sparse models. The results indicate that the proposed methodology consistently outperforms all the evaluated alternative methods. 1.

Accuracy of genomic breeding values for meat tenderness in Polled Nellore cattle.,"Zebu () cattle, mostly of the Nellore breed, comprise more than 80% of the beef cattle in Brazil, given their tolerance of the tropical climate and high resistance to ectoparasites. Despite their advantages for production in tropical environments, zebu cattle tend to produce tougher meat than Bos taurus breeds. Traditional genetic selection to improve meat tenderness is constrained by the difficulty and cost of phenotypic evaluation for meat quality. Therefore, genomic selection may be the best strategy to improve meat quality traits. This study was performed to compare the accuracies of different Bayesian regression models in predicting molecular breeding values for meat tenderness in Polled Nellore cattle. The data set was composed of Warner-Bratzler shear force (WBSF) of longissimus muscle from 205, 141, and 81 animals slaughtered in 2005, 2010, and 2012, respectively, which were selected and mated so as to create extreme segregation for WBSF. The animals were genotyped with either the Illumina BovineHD (HD; 777,000 from 90 samples) chip or the GeneSeek Genomic Profiler (GGP Indicus HD; 77,000 from 337 samples). The quality controls of SNP were Hard-Weinberg Proportion -value â‰¥ 0.1%, minor allele frequency > 1%, and call rate > 90%. The FImpute program was used for imputation from the GGP Indicus HD chip to the HD chip. The effect of each SNP was estimated using ridge regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), Bayes A, Bayes B, and Bayes CÏ€ methods. Different numbers of SNP were used, with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, or 100% of the markers preselected based on their significance test (-value from genomewide association studies [GWAS]) or randomly sampled. The prediction accuracy was assessed by the correlation between genomic breeding value and the observed WBSF phenotype, using a leave-one-out cross-validation methodology. The prediction accuracies using all markers were all very similar for all models, ranging from 0.22 (Bayes CÏ€) to 0.25 (Bayes B). When preselecting SNP based on GWAS results, the highest correlation (0.27) between WBSF and the genomic breeding value was achieved using the Bayesian LASSO model with 15,030 (3%) markers. Although this study used relatively few animals, the design of the segregating population ensured wide genetic variability for meat tenderness, which was important to achieve acceptable accuracy of genomic prediction. Although all models showed similar levels of prediction accuracy, some small advantages were observed with the Bayes B approach when higher numbers of markers were preselected based on their -values resulting from a GWAS analysis.",2016,Journal of animal science
Relating household characteristics to urban sheep keeping in West Africa,"Abstract Urban sheep production is widespread in Bobo-Dioulasso despite its formal illegality. This study was aimed at the identification of socioeconomic characteristics influencing the decisions of households to take up this activity. One hundred and thirty-six households (half of them keeping sheep, half not keeping small ruminants) were interviewed to collect data on their socioeconomic situation. Three techniques of multivariate analyses were compared. Cluster analysis and logistic regression revealed the following socioeconomic differences between the two groups: the probability of keeping sheep increases with the size of the household and the rate of illiteracy. Households are also more likely to keep sheep if urban cattle husbandry is practised, if there is only one household in the compound and if the keeper has already changed his/her trade at least once. Correspondence analysis provided visual confirmation of these results. Cluster analysis allowed a more profound understanding of the situation by drawing attention to a â€˜transitional differentiationâ€™: non-keepers in a group of keepers and vice versa tell us something about potential future keepers or non-keepers.",2001,Agricultural Systems
Aging in the Context of HIV/AIDS: Spaces for Renegotiation and Recomposition of Mutual Solidarity in Burkina Faso,"Purpose: The HIV-infected older people in sub-Saharan Africa are inevitably vulnerable to chronic health-related conditions, yet the needed social support for these people is mostly inadequate. Drawing on the anthropology of disease and health paradigms, this study explores the recomposition of multidimensional and multidirectional nature of mutual familial support for older people living with or affected by HIV/AIDS in Burkina Faso. Methods: We conducted multiple in-depth interviews among 147 individuals recruited from nonprofit organizations in Ouagadougou, Bobo-Dioulasso, Ouahigouya, and Yako through 2 projects funded by the National Agency for AIDS Research. Thematic and narrative analytical frameworks were used to analyze the data. Results: We found that older people suffered serious socioeconomic and psychological challenges associated with HIV/AIDS. Older people were particularly vulnerable to the double burden of HIV/AIDS and caregiving responsibility for family members infected with the disease. However, the infected older people who received adequate treatment and familial support regained sociocultural positions as agents for cultural transition and material/emotional resources. Conclusions: Although HIV/AIDS potentially renegotiated the nature, intensity, and direction of familial support for vulnerable older people, the extrafamily solidarity seems an integral part of the great cycle of reciprocity and intrafamily mutual support. Health and policy interventions targeted at strengthening the interpersonal relationships and support for HIV/AIDS-infected and HIV/AIDS-affected older people are needed to improve their independence and well-being.",2019,Journal of the International Association of Providers of AIDS Care

Hybrid-Controlled Neurofuzzy Networks Analysis Resulting in Genetic Regulatory Networks Reconstruction,"Reverse engineering of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) is the process of estimating genetic interactions of a cellular system from gene expression data. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid systematic algorithm based on neurofuzzy network for reconstructing GRNs from observational gene expression data when only a medium-small number of measurements are available. The approach uses fuzzy logic to transform gene expression values into qualitative descriptors that can be evaluated by using a set of defined rules. The algorithm uses neurofuzzy network to model genes effects on other genes followed by four stages of decision making to extract gene interactions. One of the main features of the proposed algorithm is that an optimal number of fuzzy rules can be easily and rapidly extracted without overparameterizing. Data analysis and simulation are conducted on microarray expression profiles of S. cerevisiae cell cycle and demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only selects the patterns of the time series gene expression data accurately, but also provides models with better reconstruction accuracy when compared with four published algorithms: DBNs, VBEM, time delay ARACNE, and PF subjected to LASSO. The accuracy of the proposed approach is evaluated in terms of recall and F-score for the network reconstruction task.",2012,ISRN Bioinformatics
A Structural Optimization Algorithm for Complex-Valued Neural Networks,"A suitable network structure can not only save the computing resources but also enhance the generalization ability of the constructed neural network. A pruning algorithm with group lasso regularization is proposed in this paper, where both the superfluous hidden and input neurons can be efficiently removed. Based on this algorithm, appropriate complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) are designed for practical applications. It is noted that the numerical ill-posed problem would be caused by the nondifferentiability of the group lasso regularization at the origin. To overcome it, a smooth function is introduced to approximate the regularization term. Then, CVNNs with good generalization capability and reasonable network structure are obtained. Experimental results on some benchmark classification problems are provided to show the performance of the proposed pruning algorithm.",2019,2019 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (SSCI)
Parental attendance and site selection of Centrolene savagei ( Ruiz-Carranza and Lynch 1991 ) in the western and central Andes of Colombia,"Centrolene savagei (Ruiz-Carranza and Lynch, 1991) is an endemic glassfrog of Colombia that is characterized by a small body size, green dorsum with dark green and white dots, rounded snout when viewed dorsally, and lack of humeral spine (Fig. 1). Since 2004, Centrolene savagei has been listed by IUCN as a vulnerable species (Castro-Herrera and Bolivar-GarcÃ­a, 2010; AmphibiaWeb, 2009), being mainly affected by the clearing of forests for agriculture and environmental pollution (Blaustein and Kiesecker, 2002). Currently, Centrolene savagei has been registered in the Central and Western Andes of Colombia (Cordilleras Occidental and Central of Colombia) in the departments of QuindÃ­o, Antioquia, Risaralda, Caldas, Tolima and Valle del Cauca (Ruiz-Carranza-Carranza and Lynch, 1991; Cadavid et al., 2005; Vargas-Salinas et al., 2007; Castro-Herrera and Vargas-Salinas, 2008; Guayasamin et al., 2008; 2009; Luna-Mora, 2011; Rojas-Morales et al., 2011; Escobar-Lasso and Rojas-Morales 2012; DiazGutiÃ©rrez et al., 2013).

Adaptive restart of accelerated gradient methods under local quadratic growth condition,"By analyzing accelerated proximal gradient methods under a local quadratic growth condition, we show that restarting these algorithms at any frequency gives a globally linearly convergent algorithm. This result was previously known only for long enough frequencies. Then, as the rate of convergence depends on the match between the frequency and the quadratic error bound, we design a scheme to automatically adapt the frequency of restart from the observed decrease of the norm of the gradient mapping. Our algorithm has a better theoretical bound than previously proposed methods for the adaptation to the quadratic error bound of the objective. We illustrate the efficiency of the algorithm on a Lasso problem and on a regularized logistic regression problem.",2019,Ima Journal of Numerical Analysis
Temperature adaptation and the contractile properties of live muscle fibres from teleost fish,"SummaryThe contractile properties of swimming muscles have been investigated in marine teleosts from Antarctic (Trematomus lepidorhinus, Pseudochaenichthys georgianus), temperate (Pollachius virens, Limanda limanda, Agonis cataphractus, Callionymus lyra), and tropical (Abudefduf abdominalis, Thalassoma duperreyi) latitudes. Small bundles of fast twitch fibres were isolated from anterior myotomes and/or the pectoral fin adductor profundis muscle (m. add. p). Live fibre preparations were viable for several days at in vivo temperatures, but became progressively inexcitable at higher or lower temperatures. The stimulation frequency required to produce fused isometric tetani increased from 50 Hz in Antarctic species at 0Â°C to around 400 Hz in tropical species at 25Â°C. Maximum isometric tension (Po) was produced at the normal body temperature (NBT) of each species (Antarctic, 0â€“2Â°C; North Sea and Atlantic, 8â€“10Â°C; Indo-West Pacific, 23â€“25Â°C). P0 values at physiological temperatures (200â€“300 kNÂ·mâˆ’2) were similar for Antarctic, temperate, and tropical species. A temperature induced â€œtension hysteresisâ€ was observed in muscle fibres from some species. Exposure to <0Â°C in Antarctic and <2Â°C in temperate fish resulted in the temporary depression of tension over the whole experimental range, an effect reversed by incubation at higher temperatures. At normal body temperatures the half-times for activation and relaxation of twitch and tetanic tension increased in the order Antarctic>temperate>tropical species. Relaxation was generally much slower at temperatures <10Â°C in fibres from tropical than temperate fish. Q10 values for these parameters at NBTs were 1.3 2.1 for tropical species, 1.7â€“2.6 for temperate species, and 1.6â€“3.5 for Antarctic species. The forcevelocity (P-V) relationship was studied in selected species using iso-velocity releases and the data below 0.8 P0 iteratively fitted to Hill's equation. The P-V relation at NBT was found to be significantly less curved in Antarctic than temperate species. The unloaded contraction velocity (Vmax) of fibres was positively correlated with NBT increasing from about 1 muscle fibre lengthÂ·sâˆ’;1 in an Antarctic fish (Trematomus lepidorhinus) at 1Â°C to around 16 muscle fibre lengthsÂ·sâˆ’1 in a tropical species (Thalassoma duperreyi) at 24Â°C. It is concluded that although muscle contraction in Antarctic fish shows adaptations for low temperature function, the degree of compensation achieved in shortening speed and twitch kinetics is relatively modest.",2004,Journal of Comparative Physiology B

Sequential profile Lasso for ultra-high-dimensional partially linear models,"ABSTRACT In this paper, we study ultra-high-dimensional partially linear models when the dimension of the linear predictors grows exponentially with the sample size. For the variable screening, we propose a sequential profile Lasso method (SPLasso) and show that it possesses the screening property. SPLasso can also detect all relevant predictors with probability tending to one, no matter whether the ultra-high models involve both parametric and nonparametric parts. To select the best subset among the models generated by SPLasso, we propose an extended Bayesian information criterion (EBIC) for choosing the final model. We also conduct simulation studies and apply a real data example to assess the performance of the proposed method and compare with the existing method.",2017,Statistical Theory and Related Fields
"Polinomorfos del TriÃ¡sico superior resedimentados en los materiales marinos eocenos de Sant LlorenÃ§ del Munt (cuenca del Ebro, NE de EspaÃ±a)","The Eocene Sant Lloren$ del Munt fan-delta complex is locatedÂ in northwestern Spain, attached to the southeastern margin of theÂ Ebro basin. The Ebro basin was developed mostly during Tertiary time inÂ response to the building of three mountain chains, the PyreneesÂ (N), the Iberian Chain (SW) and the Catalan Coastal RangesÂ (SE). During Paleogene time the SE margin of the Ebro basin wasÂ subjected to transpressive conditions which led to the developementÂ of a series of stnictures including folds, thrusts and strike-slipÂ faults. This tectonic activity uplifted a structural block located SEÂ of the Ebro basin. This uplifted block comprises mainly PaleozoicÂ basement and Mesozoic cover rocks, and was the source area of aÂ series of alluvial fans and fan deltas like the Sant Lloren$ del MuntÂ complex. After this contractional-transpressive stage, under NeogeneÂ extensional conditions, the uplifted block developed a horst-and grabenÂ structure, preserved today in the Catalan Coastal Ranges.Â The Sant Lloren$ del Munt complex has well-developed subaerialÂ and submarine portions, in whicb five main facies associations can beÂ distinguished (proxirnal auuvial-fan, dista1 alluvial-fanlfan-delta plain,Â fan-delta front, fan-delta slope/offshore and carbonate platfonn). TheseÂ deposits have been subdivided into three orders of transgressive-regressiveÂ cyclicity, expressed in three different kinds of sequences.Â Thirty-two samyiles have been taken from the Bartonian marineÂ facies in order to study their palynological content. These samples comeÂ from the lower part of the regressive megaunit of the lowest frequencyÂ transgressive-regressive sequence distinguished (Milany megasequence). In 19 of these samples Triassic-derived pollen has beenÂ found. Most of these samples are from facies and parts of the highest frequency sequences which indicate high sediment supply episodes.Â More than fifteen different Tnassic palynomorphs, most of them neverÂ before found in uppeir Triassic samples near the studied area, have beenÂ identified. Palynornorphs are typical of Tuvalian and Norian stages,Â  and upper Tnassic (Classopollis, Patinasporites densus, Vallasporites ignacii, Samaropolle~tites speciosus, Triadispora verrucata and Camerosporites secatus ). Given the high content of Triassic pollen, present in most of theÂ samples and abundanit in some of them, the source area of this complexÂ should be nch in upper Triassic rocks with abundant flora. TheÂ tetrads of some of these Tnassic-denved pollen grains indicate a shortÂ transport distance fro:m the source area. They probably came from theÂ present Valles area. 14s deduced from the proximal alluvial fan conglomerateÂ composition, the source area of the Sant Llorenq del MuntÂ complex was not exclusively constituted of Mesozoic cover rocks. ItÂ was a mixed source a;rea with also the presence of Paleozoic basementÂ rocks, which are the rnost important clast-component of the proximalÂ alluvial fan conglomerates (laterally equivalent to the sampled section).Â Based on the palynological study, we consider the source areaÂ richer in upper Tnassic rocks than tpreviously tbought from study ofÂ the alluvial fan conglomerate-clasts composition.Â There is a certairi relationship among the sequences, the contentÂ of resedimented Tnassic-denved poiien and the degree of preservationÂ of the pollen grains.

Clinical and radiologic results of arthroscopic biceps tenodesis with suture anchor in the setting of rotator cuff tear.,"BACKGROUND
The purpose of this study was to report clinical and radiologic results of arthroscopic biceps tenodesis with 1 suture anchor in rotator cuff tear patients.


METHODS
During a 2-year period, 84 consecutive patients (45 men; 39 women) who underwent arthroscopic tenodesis were evaluated retrospectively. Mean age was 58 years. The primary indication for surgery was rotator cuff tear in 96.4%. Tenodesis was performed with 1 suture anchor placed in the bicipital groove with 2 knots, 1 lasso-type and 1 that pierced the tendon. At final follow-up at a mean of 33.2 months, visual analog scale pain (pain-VAS) score, shoulder scores (American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons [ASES] and Constant score), Popeye deformity (PD), anterior arm pain, and elbow flexion power were evaluated. Postoperative magnetic resonance images were evaluated in 60 patients to determine the integrity of the tenodesis and the location of the suture anchor.


RESULTS
The average pain-VAS decreased from 5.3 to 1.4 (P < .001). ASES and Constant scores significantly increased, from 42.9 and 56.2 to 85.2 and 82.5, respectively. PD occurred in 11 patients (12.9%), and 2 (2.3%) had self-consciousness; however, no patients complained about the deformity and the PD did not correlate with poorer clinical scores. Six patients (7.1%) complained of anterior cramping pain. Elbow flexion power was similar compared with the contralateral side. In postoperative magnetic resonance imagine analysis, 15 patients (25%) showed distal migration of tenodesed biceps tendon, although only 6 (7.1%) had clinical PD. Postoperative clinical outcomes were not influenced by the location of the suture anchor within the bicipital groove.


CONCLUSIONS
Arthroscopic biceps tenodesis with 1 suture anchor resulted in good clinical outcomes at 2 years postoperatively. PD was seen in 12.9% of the patients.",2014,Journal of shoulder and elbow surgery
Change in Distant Atrial Activation Patterns During Circumferential Pacemapping of Pulmonic Vein Ostium: Implications for Localizing Triggers for Atrial Fibrillation,"AbstractIntroduction: Unique intracardiac activation patterns recorded from multipolar catheters in the coronary sinus (CS) and posteromedial right atrium (RA) when pacing from ostium (os) of each pulmonic vein (PV) can serve as template for determining PV of origin of atrial premature complexes. Development of an accurate template requires knowledge of variations in activation pattern during pacing from different aspects of same PV.
Methods: In 25 patients undergoing catheter ablation for AF, a decapolar Lasso mapping catheter was placed at PV os of interest and multipolar catheters were placed in CS and RAâ€”medial to crista terminalis (CT). For each PV, pacing was performed from Lasso catheter poles 1 through 10. For each bipole paced, activation sequence in CS (proximal to distal & vice-versa) was assessed, activation time (pacing stimulus to earliest electrogram recorded in catheters in CS/along CT) was measured and difference (CS âˆ’ CT time) was determined. Significant interpolar variation was defined as the difference between the shortest and longest CS âˆ’ CT activation time of â‰¥25 msec when pacing from different bipoles of same PV.
Results:In 59 PVs [19 right superior (RS), 20 left superior (LS), 8 right inferior (RI) and 12 left inferior (LI)], 259 bipoles were paced (median of 4 bipoles/PV). During circumferential PV pacing activation sequence in CS catheter was distal to proximal in 84.4% left-sided PVs (LSPV and LIPV) and proximal to distal in 92.6% right-sided PVs (RSPV and RIPV) with no change in activation sequence observed during pacing from different bipoles in same PV. Significant interpolar variation was observed with circumferential pacing in 1 of 19 RSPV (5.3%), 2 of 20 LSPV (10%), 1 of 12 LIPV (8.3%) and none of RIPV.
Conclusion: Unique intracardiac activation patterns during ostial pacing from individual PV are not influenced by circumferential location of pacing site.",2004,Journal of Interventional Cardiac Electrophysiology

Multiple Faults Detection for Rotating Machinery Based on Bicomponent Sparse Low-Rank Matrix Separation Approach,"Multifault detection of rotating machinery at the incipient fault stage presents a challenging issue due to its interaction feature, complexity, and coupling characteristics. Aiming at the concern of identifying the multiple faults pattern of rotating machinery, a novel multiple faults detection approach based on Bi-component sparse low-rank matrix separation is proposed in this paper. The core idea of the proposed method is that the measured vibration signal typically shows as the sum of transient component and oscillatory component, meanwhile, the multi-fault identification problem with regularization terms can be transformed into a sparse optimization formulation that could be solved by the alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm. The proposed approach is applied by simulated synthetic signal, experimental data including rolling bearing and gearbox with weak multiple faults, and its effectiveness and superiority are verified by comparing to some state-of-the-art methods such as L1-norm fused lasso optimization, maximum correlated kurtosis deconvolution, and ensemble empirical mode decomposition.",2018,IEEE Access
On U-Statistics and Compressed Sensing I: Non-Asymptotic Average-Case Analysis,"Hoeffding's U-statistics model combinatorial-type matrix parameters (appearing in CS theory) in a natural way. This paper proposes using these statistics for analyzing random compressed sensing matrices, in the non-asymptotic regime (relevant to practice). The aim is to address certain pessimisms of ""worst-case"" restricted isometry analyses, as observed by both Blanchard & Dossal, et. al. We show how U-statistics can obtain ""average-case"" analyses, by relating to statistical restricted isometry property (StRIP) type recovery guarantees. However unlike standard StRIP, random signal models are not required; the analysis here holds in the almost sure (probabilistic) sense. For Gaussian/bounded entry matrices, we show that both â„“1-minimization and LASSO essentially require on the order of k Â· [log((n-k)/u) + âˆš(2(k/n) \log(n/k))] measurements to respectively recover at least 1-5u fraction, and 1-4u fraction, of the signals. Noisy conditions are considered. Empirical evidence suggests our analysis to compare well to Donoho & Tanner's recent large deviation bounds for â„“0/â„“1-equivalence, in the regime of block lengths 1000~3000 with high undersampling (50-150 measurements); similar system sizes are found in recent CS implementation. In this work, it is assumed throughout that matrix columns are independently sampled.",2013,IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing

The log-linear group-lasso estimator and its asymptotic properties,"We define the group-lasso estimator for the natural parameters of the exponential families of distributions representing hierarchical log-linear models under multinomial sampling scheme. Such estimator arises as the solution of a convex penalized likelihood optimization problem based on the group-lasso penalty. We illustrate how it is possible to construct an estimator of the underlying log-linear model using the blocks of nonzero coefficients recovered by the group-lasso procedure. We investigate the asymptotic properties of the group-lasso estimator as a model selection method in a double-asymptotic framework, in which both the sample size and the model complexity grow simultaneously. We provide conditions guaranteeing that the group-lasso estimator is model selection consistent, in the sense that, with overwhelming probability as the sample size increases, it correctly identifies all the sets of nonzero interactions among the variables. Provided the sequences of true underlying models is sparse enough, recovery is possible even if the number of cells grows larger than the sample size. Finally, we derive some central limit type of results for the log-linear group-lasso estimator.",2012,Bernoulli
"Stability selection for lasso, ridge and elastic net implemented with AFT models","Abstract The instability in the selection of models is a major concern with data sets containing a large number of covariates. We focus on stability selection which is used as a technique to improve variable selection performance for a range of selection methods, based on aggregating the results of applying a selection procedure to sub-samples of the data where the observations are subject to right censoring. The accelerated failure time (AFT) models have proved useful in many contexts including the heavy censoring (as for example in cancer survival) and the high dimensionality (as for example in micro-array data). We implement the stability selection approach using three variable selection techniquesâ€”Lasso, ridge regression, and elastic net applied to censored data using AFT models. We compare the performances of these regularized techniques with and without stability selection approaches with simulation studies and two real data examplesâ€“a breast cancer data and a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma data. The results suggest that stability selection gives always stable scenario about the selection of variables and that as the dimension of data increases the performance of methods with stability selection also improves compared to methods without stability selection irrespective of the collinearity between the covariates.",2019,Statistical Applications in Genetics and Molecular Biology

Action following the discovery of a global association between the whole genome and adverse event risk in a clinical drug-development programme.,"Observation of adverse drug reactions during drug development can cause closure of the whole programme. However, if association between the genotype and the risk of an adverse event is discovered, then it might suffice to exclude patients of certain genotypes from future recruitment. Various sequential and non-sequential procedures are available to identify an association between the whole genome, or at least a portion of it, and the incidence of adverse events. In this paper we start with a suspected association between the genotype and the risk of an adverse event and suppose that the genetic subgroups with elevated risk can be identified. Our focus is determination of whether the patients identified as being at risk should be excluded from further studies of the drug. We propose using a utility function to determine the appropriate action, taking into account the relative costs of suffering an adverse reaction and of failing to alleviate the patient's disease. Two illustrative examples are presented, one comparing patients who suffer from an adverse event with contemporary patients who do not, and the other making use of a reference control group. We also illustrate two classification methods, LASSO and CART, for identifying patients at risk, but we stress that any appropriate classification method could be used in conjunction with the proposed utility function. Our emphasis is on determining the action to take rather than on providing definitive evidence of an association.",2009,Pharmaceutical statistics

"LASSO-type penalization in the framework of generalized additive models for location, scale and shape","For numerous applications it is of interest to provide full probabilistic forecasts, which are able to assign probabilities to each predicted outcome. Therefore, attention is shifting constantly from conditional mean models to probabilistic distributional models capturing location, scale, shape (and other aspects) of the response distribution. One of the most established models for distributional regression is the generalized additive model for location, scale and shape (GAMLSS). In high dimensional data set-ups classical fitting procedures for the GAMLSS often become rather unstable and methods for variable selection are desirable. Therefore, we propose a regularization approach for high dimensional data set-ups in the framework for GAMLSS. It is designed for linear covariate effects and is based on L1 -type penalties. The following three penalization options are provided: the conventional least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) for metric covariates, and both group and fused LASSO for categorical predictors. The methods are investigated both for simulated data and for two real data examples, namely Munich rent data and data on extreme operational losses from the Italian bank UniCredit.",2019,Comput.

[Diversity of culturable sulfur-oxidizing bacteria in deep-sea hydrothermal vent environments of the South Atlantic].,"OBJECTIVE
To investigate the diversity of culturable sulfur-oxidizing bacteria in hydrothermal vent environments of the South Atlantic, and analyze their characteristics of sulfur oxidation.


METHODS
We enriched and isolated sulfur-oxidizing bacteria from hydrothermal vent samples collected from the South Atlantic. The microbial diversity in enrichment cultures was analyzed using the Denatural Gradient Gel Electrophoresis method. Sulfur-oxidizing characteristics of the isolates was further studied by using ion chromatography.


RESULTS
A total of 48 isolates were obtained from the deep-sea hydrothermal vent samples, which belonged to 23 genera and mainly grouped into alpha-Proteobacteria (58.3%), Actinobacteria (22.9%) and gama-Proteobacteria (18.8%). Among them, the genus Thalassospira, Martelella and Microbacterium were dominant. About 60% of the isolates exibited sulfur-oxidizing ability and strain L6M1-5 had a higher sulfur oxidation rate by comparison analysis.


CONCLUSION
The diversity of sulfur-oxidizing bacteria in hydrothermal environments of the South Atlantic was reported for the first time based on culture-dependent methods. The result will help understand the biogechemical process of sulfur compounds in the deep-sea hydrothermal environments.",2016,Wei sheng wu xue bao = Acta microbiologica Sinica
On Efficiently Solving the Subproblems of a Level-Set Method for Fused Lasso Problems,"In applying the level-set method developed in [Van den Berg and Friedlander, SIAM J. on Scientific Computing, 31 (2008), pp.~890--912 and SIAM J. on Optimization, 21 (2011), pp.~1201--1229] to solve the fused lasso problems, one needs to solve a sequence of regularized least squares subproblems. In order to make the level-set method practical, we develop a highly efficient inexact semismooth Newton based augmented Lagrangian method for solving these subproblems. The efficiency of our approach is based on several ingredients that constitute the main contributions of this paper. Firstly, an explicit formula for constructing the generalized Jacobian of the proximal mapping of the fused lasso regularizer is derived. Secondly, the special structure of the generalized Jacobian is carefully extracted and analyzed for the efficient implementation of the semismooth Newton method. Finally, numerical results, including the comparison between our approach and several state-of-the-art solvers, on real data sets are presented to demonstrate the high efficiency and robustness of our proposed algorithm in solving challenging large-scale fused lasso problems.",2018,SIAM Journal on Optimization
Enriched taxa were found among the gut microbiota of centenarians in East China,"BACKGROUND
Gut microbiota is closely related to age. Studies from Europe and the U.S. identified featured microbiota in different age groups for the elderly. Asian studies mainly focused on people living in longevity areas. Featured microbiota for the elderly people of different age groups, especially in the centenarian in the general population, has not been well investigated in China.


METHOD
We conducted a comparative study by including 198 subjects of three age groups (65-70, 90-99, and 100+ years) in East China. Information regarding age, sex, height, weight, waist circumference, hip circumference, food preference, smoking status and alcohol consumption were collected by using a structured questionnaire. Fecal samples for each participant were collected as well. 16S rRNA gene sequencing were employed to analyze the gut microbiota composition. Logistic regression with LASSO feature selection was used to identify featured taxa in different age groups and to assess their potential interactions with other factors such as lifestyle.


RESULT
The gut microbiota of the 90-99 year and 100+ year age groups showed more diversity, robustness, and richness compared with the 65-70 year age group. PCoA analysis showed a clear separation between the 65-70 and 100+ year age groups. At the species level, Bacteroides fragilis, Parabacteroides merdae, Ruminococcus gnavus, Coprococcus and Clostridium perfringens increased, but Bacteroides vulgatus, Ruminococcus sp.5139BFAA and Clostridium sp.AT5 decreased in the 90-99 year age group. The age differences in gut microbiota were similar across the strata of smoking, alcohol consumption status and food preference.


CONCLUSION
Our study demonstrated age differences in many aspects of gut microbiota, such as overall diversity, microbiota structure, and relative abundance of key taxa. Moreover, the gut microbiota of centenarian was significantly different from those of younger age groups of the elderly.",2019,PLoS ONE
Hydrodynamic modeling to evaluate the influence of constructed side-channel habitat on larval drift of pallid strugeon in the Lower Missouri River,"Larval drift is a critical phase of ontogeny for many species of lotic fishes. Downstream advection and dispersion of drifting larvae or eggs is controlled by the complex interaction of flow regime, channel planform, local channel morphology, and the resulting hydraulic gradients. In many regulated rivers, channel engineering and perturbations to the flow regime may disrupt natural dispersal processes and prevent successful recruitment of native fishes. Here, we explore the influence of flow regime and channel morphology on the downstream transport, dispersion, and retention of free embryos of pallid sturgeon (Scaphirhychus albus), an endangered species endemic to the Mississippi River basin and the focus of significant conservation effort on the Missouri River. The transition from drifting free embryo to exogenously feeding larvae has been identified as a potential life stage bottleneck for the pallid sturgeon. We use a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model to evaluate the sensitivity of drift and dispersion to in-channel navigation structures, constructed shallow-water habitat, and flood hydrology. In the simulations, larvae were treated as passively drifting particles and calculated retention times were used as an index of potential for settling and retention within specific environments. During low flows, retention of larvae is promoted by shallow, low velocity conditions provided by constructed side-channel habitats. At higher flows, retention is driven by overbank flows that inundate the floodplain. Based on insights gained from the analysis of field data and modeling outputs, we consider the effects of flow regime modifications or channel re-engineering on the distribution and retention of free embryos within the Lower Missouri River. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND The Missouri River has been profoundly transformed by over two centuries of river management and channel alterations (Jacobson and Galat, 2006). The river is the longest river in the United States and has a drainage area of more than 1,300,000 km 2 , draining the eastern Rocky Mountains, Great Plains, and a small area of Canada (Figure 1A). Six large mainstem dams have substantially altered the natural flow regime, reducing the magnitude of annual floods and elevating base flows (Galat and Lipkin, 2000). The Lower Missouri River (LMOR) is defined as the 1,300 km of the Missouri River downstream from Gavins Point Dam near Yankton, South Dakota to the confluence with the Mississippi River, near Saint Louis, Missouri. Extensive channelization and construction of training structures (e.g. dikes and bank revetment) in the LMOR have converted the channel from one that was historically a broad, shallow, braided channel to a relatively deep and narrow navigation channel with less morphologic diversity (Jacobson and Galat, 2006). Ongoing efforts to inform management of the Missouri River as part of Missouri River Recovery Program are focused on the recovery of three endangered or threatened species â€“ the pallid sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus albus), piping plover (Charadrius melodus), and interior least tern (Sternula antillarum athalassos) (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2000, 2003). Pallid sturgeon are endemic to the Mississippi River basin and are the focus of significant conservation efforts on the Missouri River. Subjected to years of heavy commercial fishing, declining water quality, a highly altered flow regime, and extensive habitat alternations, the pallid sturgeon was formally listed as a federally endangered species in 1990. Current recovery efforts focus on habitat restoration and hatchery augmentation, implemented through an adaptive management framework. However, it remains unclear what factor(s) are primarily responsible for decline of the species and what actions may be most effective in promoting successful recruitment. Figure 1 (A) The Lower Missouri River, (B) the Lisbon-Jameson reach (River Mile (RM) 210.0219.1), and (C) the Miami reach (RM 259.6 â€“ 263.5). River miles are the customary units of longitudinal measurement on the LMOR. They are measured upstream from St. Louis, MO and correspond to the channel position in 1960. Recent research identifies the transition from drifting free embryo to exogenously feeding larvae as a life stage that may limit successful recruitment of pallid sturgeon in the Missouri River (Kynard and others, 2007; DeLonay and others, 2009a; Braaten and others, 2012). As is common for many lotic fishes (Muth and Schmulbach, 1984; Brown and Armstrong, 1985; Pavlov and others, 2008), pallid sturgeon undergo a period of drift and dispersal post-hatch. During this developmental phase, sturgeon free embryos may be transported several hundred kilometers downstream from the site at which spawning occurred (Kynard and others, 2007). On regulated rivers such as the Missouri River natural patterns of downstream transport and dispersal may be disrupted by extensive channel modifications and flow regulation (Erwin and Jacobson, 2014). Construction of side-channel chutes has emerged as one of the primary restoration techniques used in the LMOR (Jacobson and others, 2004). The relatively shallow depths and slow velocities provided by such features are thought to increase the retention of drifting larvae within the LMOR, disrupting downstream advection in the channelized portion of the river and providing an environment suitable for foraging when the free embryos transition to exogenous feeding. Here, we present the preliminary results of a hydraulic modeling study designed to explore the influence of flow regime and channel morphology on the downstream transport, dispersion, and retention of larval pallid sturgeon.",2015,
Predicting Psychiatric Hospitalizations among Elderly Veterans with a History of Mental Health Disease,"Introduction
Patient Aligned Care Team (PACT) care managers are tasked with identifying aging Veterans with psychiatric disease in attempt to prevent psychiatric crises. However, few resources exist that use real-time information on patient risk to prioritize coordinating appropriate care amongst a complex aging population.


Objective
To develop and validate a model to predict psychiatric hospital admission, during a 90-day risk window, in Veterans ages 65 or older with a history of mental health disease.


Methods
This study applied a cohort design to historical data available in the Veterans Affairs (VA) Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW). The Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regularization regression technique was used for model development and variable selection. Individual predicted probabilities were estimated using logistic regression. A split-sample approach was used in performing external validation of the fitted model. The concordance statistic (C-statistic) was calculated to assess model performance.


Results
Prior to modeling, 61 potential candidate predictors were identified and 27 variables remained after applying the LASSO method. The final model's predictive accuracy is represented by a C-statistic of 0.903. The model's predictive accuracy during external validation is represented by a C-statistic of 0.935. Having a previous psychiatric hospitalization, psychosis, bipolar disorder, and the number of mental-health related social work encounters were strong predictors of a geriatric psychiatric hospitalization.


Conclusion
This predictive model is capable of quantifying the risk of a geriatric psychiatric hospitalization with acceptable performance and allows for the development of interventions that could potentially reduce such risk.",2018,eGEMs

"Microbial diversity in the hypersaline Lake Meyghan, Iran","Lake Meyghan is one of the largest and commercially most important salt lakes in Iran. Despite its inland location and high altitude, Lake Meyghan has a thalassohaline salt composition suggesting a marine origin. Inputs of fresh water by rivers and rainfall formed various basins characterized by different salinities. We analyzed the microbial community composition of three basins by isolation and culturing of microorganisms and by analysis of the metagenome. The basins that were investigated comprised a green ~50â€‰gâ€‰kgâˆ’1 salinity brine, a red ~180â€‰gâ€‰kgâˆ’1 salinity brine and a white ~300â€‰gâ€‰kgâˆ’1 salinity brine. Using different growth media, 57 strains of Bacteria and 48 strains of Archaea were isolated. Two bacterial isolates represent potential novel species with less than 96% 16S rRNA gene sequence identity to known species. Abundant isolates were also well represented in the metagenome. Bacteria dominated the low salinity brine, with Alteromonadales (Gammaproteobacteria) as a particularly important taxon, whereas the high salinity brines were dominated by haloarchaea. Although the brines of Lake Meyghan differ in geochemical composition, their ecosystem function appears largely conserved amongst each other while being driven by different microbial communities.",2017,Scientific Reports

Descobrint el vulcanisme quaternari de la Garrotxa: De les observacions precientÃ­fiques als primers estudis geolÃ³gics (s. XVI - XIX),"Aragones i Valls, E. Discovery of the quaternary vulcanism in the Garrotxa region: from pre-scientific observations to early geological surveys (16th-19th centuries). From a critical review of pre-1830 literature on the Garrotxa volcanic region, the discovery and early surveys on vulcanism in the area are discussed. In the 16th century, volcanic activity was assumed in relation to the 1427 earthquake; in the 17th century, several descriptions of volcanic rocks and bufadors (also called air volcanos) were published. Ancient vulcanism was identified a few years before 1775; early scientific surveys since 1796 were made by Pourret, a French botanist, and were continued by Francesc Bolos; these studies remained unpublished for years. In 1808 the geologist Maclure came to the region and published the first scientific paper in relation to the volcanos of the area. After the napoleonic wars, several Catalan scientists were interested in volcanic materials of Olot: Mirambell, a naturalist; Celles, an arquitect, and Carbonell i Bravo, a chemist who managed to publish the first monographic paper on this zone, signed by Bolos, in 1820. In France, in a book issued in 1823, Palassou included some of PourretÂ´s notes, following the botanistÂ´s death. A new survey was made by geologists of the French Geological Map, from which a new monographic paper was written by Debilly (1828).",2001,
Variable selection for international bankruptcy forecasts,"Corporate financial distress not only incurs serious financial loss to its creditors but also has a high cost to the society and the country's economy. Consequently, financial distress prediction studies are important to all those involved: owners, shareholders, lenders, suppliers, and government. In this paper, we focus on the corporate bankruptcy prediction for international market using CompuStat Global database. First, we introduce a robust variable selection technique, called adaptive lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator), on the global corporate bankruptcy data in search for a parsimonious default forecasting model. Second, we demonstrate a comprehensive case study on Japan bankruptcy prediction. Comparing to US and UK, significant variables selected are generally different across countries. Only firm's activity indicator Sales/Total Assets displays uniform significance across three countries.",2013,2013 Suzhou-Silicon Valley-Beijing International Innovation Conference
Prediction of pKa Using Machine Learning Methods with Rooted Topological Torsion Fingerprints: Application to Aliphatic Amines.,"The acid-base dissociation constant, pKa, is a key parameter to define the ionization state of a compound and directly affects its biopharmaceutical profile. In this study, we developed a novel approach for pKa prediction using rooted topological torsion fingerprints in combination with five machine learning methods: random forest, partial least squares, extreme gradient boosting, Lasso regression and support vector regression. With a large and diverse set of 14,999 experimental pKa values, pKa models were developed for aliphatic amines. The models demonstrated consistently good prediction statistics and were able to generate accurate prospective predictions as validated with an external test set of 726 pKa values (RMSE 0.45, MAE 0.33, R2 0.84 by the top model). The factors that may affect prediction accuracy and model applicability were carefully assessed. The results demonstrated that rooted topological torsion fingerprints coupled with machine learning methods provide a promising approach for developing accurate pKa prediction models.",2019,Journal of chemical information and modeling
An alpha-defensin gene single nucleotide polymorphism modulates the gut microbiota and may alter the risk of acute graft-versus-host disease.,"We previously reported a protective association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; rs4415345G and rs4610776A alleles) of Paneth cell Î±-defensin-5 against acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD). Because dysbiosis has been associated with aGVHD, we hypothesized that these SNPs may have a gut microbiota signature. In Lasso regression analysis of 248 healthy individuals, rs4415345G was associated with a higher abundance of Odoribacter splanchnicus, an anaerobic butyrogenic commensal. In multivariable analysis of data from 613 allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplant recipients, peri-engraftment presence of O.Â splanchnicus was associated with ~50% lower risk for grade II-IV aGVHD (hazard ratio 0Â·53, 95% confidence interval 0Â·28-1Â·00, PÂ =Â 0Â·05). O.Â splanchnicus may protect rs4415345G individuals against aGVHD.",2020,British journal of haematology

Estudio de los mecanismos moleculares implicados en la muerte celular inducida por terfenadina en cÃ©lulas de melanoma humano,"El melanoma maligno es el cancer de piel mas agresivo y su incidencia ha idoaumentando en los ultimos anos. Si bien el melanoma primario es curable cuando sediagnostica en estadios tempranos, no existe un tratamiento efectivo para el melanomametastatico; por ello es primordial la busqueda de nuevos agentes antineoplasicos.Trabajos anteriores del grupo demostraron que la histamina aumenta la proliferacion decelulas de melanoma humano y que la terfenadina (TEF), un antagonista del receptorH1 de la histamina, induce apoptosis en varias lineas de melanoma humano, pero no asien melanocitos normales. El incremento de calcio citosolico es un evento clave e inicialen este proceso apoptotico y es producido por la salida de calcio del RE (reticuloendoplasmatico) como consecuencia de la activacion de la via de la PLC(phospholipase C)-IP3R (inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor).El objetivo general de este trabajo es conocer en profundidad los mecanismosmoleculares intracelulares implicados en la muerte celular inducida por la TEF en lascelulas del melanoma humano para poder evaluar su potencial farmacologico en sutratamiento clinico. Para ello hemos analizado el efecto de diferentes dosis de TEF endiferentes condiciones de cultivo sobre celulas de melanoma humano.En este estudio hemos demostrado que la TEF induce apoptosis en varias lineas demelanoma humano de forma dependiente de la dosis y del tiempo de tratamiento, tantoen medio suplementado con 10% de suero bovino fetal como en ausencia total de suero.Sin embargo, la presencia de suero en el medio de cultivo retrasa el efecto citotoxico dela TEF sobre las celulas de melanoma. La TEF puede inducir vias apoptoticas distintas,la importancia de las cuales depende de la dosis utilizada y de las condiciones decultivo. En respuesta a tratamientos con dosis elevadas de TEF en medio libre de suero,las principales caspasas que se activan son la caspasa-2, activada por dano en el DNA, yla caspasa-4, activada por la salida de calcio reticular. En cambio, cuando las celulasson tratadas con dosis mas bajas o en presencia de suero, ademas de las mencionadascaspasas-2 y -4, tambien la caspasa-9 toma parte en la induccion apoptotica. En esteultimo caso, el dano en el DNA y la apoptosis inducida por TEF dependen de laproduccion de radicales libres o ROS (reactive oxygen species) y la via de senalizacionactivada por ATM (ataxia telangectasia mutated) esta involucrada. Asi mismo, la TEFinduce la acumulacion de p73 y Noxa de forma dependiente de la produccion de ROS.En este caso la TEF induce apoptosis de forma independiente de p53.Por otra parte, la TEF induce autofagia de forma simultanea a la apoptosis. De formasimilar a la apoptosis, la induccion de autofagia depende de la generacion de ROScuando las celulas son tratadas en medio completo, pero no en ausencia de suero. Laautofagia inducida por TEF en celulas de melanoma humano conduce a la eliminacionde la celula, de forma que puede constituir una ruta alternativa de muerte celular ofavorecer la muerte celular a traves de la apoptosis.Finalmente hemos demostrado que, en celulas de melanoma humano, la TEF actua deforma independiente al receptor H1 de la histamina y que los nucleotidos ciclicos notoman parte en el mecanismo de accion de la TEF. Sorprendentemente, hemosobservado que la inhibicion de la actividad tirosina quinasa bloquea el efecto citotoxicode la TEF, la liberacion de calcio reticular, el dano en el DNA y la apoptosis. Estosresultados indican que la isoforma de PLC activada por TEF podria ser la PLC?, que esactivada por tirosina quinasas, y no la PLCs, la cual es activada por receptoresacoplados a proteinas G.En resumen, este estudio proporciona un mayor conocimiento de las vias moleculares atraves de las cuales la TEF induce apoptosis y demuestra su gran potencial como agenteinductor de muerte en celulas de melanoma humano.",2012,

A Deep Learning Model for Measuring Oxygen Content of Boiler Flue Gas,"The oxygen content of boiler flue gas is a valid indicator of boiler efficiency and emissions. Measuring the oxygen content of boiler flue gas is time consuming and costly. To overcome the latter shortcomings, a novel deep belief network algorithm based hybrid prediction model for the oxygen content of boiler flue gas is proposed. First, the algorithm is used to build a model based on the historical data collected from the distribution control system. The variables are divided into control variables and state variables to meet the needs of advanced control requirement. Then, a lasso algorithm is used to select variables highly related to the oxygen content as the inputs of the prediction model. Two basic models based on the deep-belief network are established, one using control variables, and the other, state variables. Finally, the two basic models are combined with a least square support vector machine to improve prediction accuracy of the oxygen content of boiler flue gas. To test the accuracy of the proposed algorithm, experiments based on three industrial datasets are performed. Performance of the comparison of the proposed deep belief algorithm is compared with five machine learning algorithms. Computational experience has shown that the model derived with the deep-belief algorithm produced better accuracy than the models generated by the other algorithms.",2020,IEEE Access

"Bjarne Melkevik y Luc Vigneault, eds., Droits dÃ©mocratiques et identitÃ©s","Obra colectiva, dirigida por Bjarne Melkevik y Luc Vigneault que se ocupa de los derechos democraticos e identidades, en la que colaboran Louis LeBel, Genevieve Nootens, Josiane Boulad-Ayouf, Paul Dumochel, Paul-Monique Vernes, Isabelle Duplessis y los dos editores. Temas diversos, sin orden ni concierto, que responden a un contenido tan dispar como inconcreto, que gira en torno a derechos democraticos e identidades, lo que permite escribir de todo, y sin necesidad de tener un particular criterio o metodo identitario. Los derechos humanos son asumidos con considerandos bien distintos a como los desarrolla en algunas charlas el gran plagiario Emilio Lecuona Prats. Para Dumouchel es de destacar el afamado librito de Immanuel Kant, Â«Sobre la paz perpetuaÂ» de 1795, que pretende presentar una posible solucion a la guerra entre los diversos paises y naciones. Witold Gombrowicz, el conocido pensador polaco, reflexionando sobre el imperativo categorico de Kant de que es necesario obrar moralmente, entendiendo consecuentemente que ha de ser desinteresado el imperativo moral, llega a la conclusion de que de ahi se deriva que Â«en nuestros dias, la moral depende enteramente de la voluntad... Por ejemplo, si mi madre esta enferma y yo, con la mas sincera voluntad de curarla, le suministro por error una medicina mortal, desde el punto de vista moral estoy salvado. Por eso todos los grandes monstruos de la historia como Hitler o Stalin, deben [si aplicamos la interpretacion kantiana] ser juzgados en base a sus intenciones. Si Hitler pensaba que los judios eran el mal de la humanidad, esta a salvo desde el punto de vista moral. Pero si actuaba por intereses personales, era inmoral. La moral para el, era la voluntad moral, la buena voluntadÂ». Llevar las tesis kantianas al extremo conduce a cuestiones execrables. Pongamos otros ejemplos. Si Emilio Lecuona Prats, para conseguir su objetivo de ganar una plaza de profesor asociado a tiempo completo, plagia completamente, valga la redundancia, sacandolo de un diskette algo escrito por otro, que no estaba publicado pero si habia sido presentado a una oposicion de catedra de Universidad, habria que preguntarse si acaso el imperativo categorico de Lecuona es desinteresado para que sea moralmente valido cuando iba en perjuicio de terceros. Igualmente Lecuona Prats ha hecho pasar por capitulos de libros lo que son las charlas que se imparten en los cursos de mayores de la Universidad de Malaga. Es decir, la UMA para compensar a los que las dictaban les publicaba el texto, pero la Consejeria de Innovacion, Ciencia y Empresa de la Junta de Andalucia considero de tan baja calidad este tipo de aportaciones que en 2005 dio ordenes al SICA, que contiene la casi totalidad de la informacion investigadora de Andalucia, que suprimiera de la base de capitulos de libro esas conferencias publicadas y las destinara a un cajon de sastre con informacion cientifica de tercer nivel, con las recensiones, articulos en los periodicos, noticias divulgativas, etc. Eran clases sencillisimas, vulgares, dirigidas a oyentes de muy poca preparacion. Ademas, Lecuona Prats ha ido a Chicago, donde vive su hermana, a estudiar el derecho de la Luisiana para publicarlo en Madrid y Valparaiso de Chile, no en Chicago, ni en Luisiana, y eso es como si uno va a San Petersburgo para estudiar el fuero de Almendralejo (la distancia es muy parecida a la que hay entre Chicago y Nueva Orleans) para publicar luego un articulo en Mendoza (Argentina) y otro en Salamanca. Habria que preguntarse donde radica la moralidad en el sentido kantiano de dichos actos. O cuando Maria Emma Montanos Ferrin se apodera de trabajos de investigacion y de papeles de Alfonso Otero Varela y de su escuela compostelana y los publica con su nombre, tambien habria que abrir el interrogante de si es licito o no, porque para ella, para Montanos Ferrin, su moral profesional es posible que admita el plagio y la copia de Alfonso Otero Varela y de Francesco Calasso, o de Celestino Pardo. Dicho de otro modo, quien se puede atrever a decir que Emma Montanos no es libre para elegir sus imperativos morales categoricos y plagiar, copiar y llevarse papeles que han escrito otros que le sirvan luego para publicar un articulo suyo.",2010,Revista CrÃ­tica de Historia de las Relaciones Laborales y de la PolÃ­tica Social
Globally sparse and locally dense signal recovery for compressed sensing,"Abstract Sparsity regularized least squares are very popular for the solution of the underdetermined linear inverse problem. One of the recent progress is that structural information is incorporated to the sparse signal recovery for compressed sensing. Sparse group signal model, which is also called block-sparse signal, is one example in this way. In this paper, the internal structure of each group is further defined to get the globally sparse and locally dense group signal model. It assumes that most of the entries in the active groups are nonzero. To estimate this newly defined signal, minimization of the l 1 norm of the total variation is incorporated to the group Lasso which is the combination of a sparsity constraint and a data fitting constraint. The newly proposed optimization model is called globally sparse and locally dense group Lasso. The added total variation based constraint can encourage local dense distribution in each group. Theoretical analysis is performed to give a class of theoretical sufficient conditions to guarantee successful recovery. Simulations demonstrate the proposed method×³s performance gains against Lasso and group Lasso.",2014,J. Frankl. Inst.

Spherical Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for Constrained Target Distributions,"Statistical models with constrained probability distributions are abundant in machine learning. Some examples include regression models with norm constraints (e.g., Lasso), probit models, many copula models, and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) models. Bayesian inference involving probability distributions confined to constrained domains could be quite challenging for commonly used sampling algorithms. For such problems, we propose a novel Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method that provides a general and computationally efficient framework for handling boundary conditions. Our method first maps the D-dimensional constrained domain of parameters to the unit ball [Formula: see text], then augments it to a D-dimensional sphere SD such that the original boundary corresponds to the equator of SD . This way, our method handles the constraints implicitly by moving freely on the sphere generating proposals that remain within boundaries when mapped back to the original space. To improve the computational efficiency of our algorithm, we divide the dynamics into several parts such that the resulting split dynamics has a partial analytical solution as a geodesic flow on the sphere. We apply our method to several examples including truncated Gaussian, Bayesian Lasso, Bayesian bridge regression, and a copula model for identifying synchrony among multiple neurons. Our results show that the proposed method can provide a natural and efficient framework for handling several types of constraints on target distributions.",2014,JMLR workshop and conference proceedings

Development of a frailty score based on hospital discharge data linked to cohort data,"IntroductionFrailty is strongly associated with adverse health outcomes and health care costs in elders. However, we have almost no idea of the prevalence of frail older inpatients in Swiss hospitals. Hospital discharge data could contribute to predicting frailty in these patients, and eventually improving SwissDRGs system or casemix-adjustment. 
Objectives and ApproachThe HFrailty project aimed to develop a predictive model of Friedâ€™s Frailty Phenotype (FFP) based on hospital discharge data. We linked Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV) discharge data to clinical data from the Lausanne cohort study (Lc65+) over the period 2004-2015. The Lc65+ is a longitudinal population-based cohort comprising three random samples of approximately 1500 Lausanne residents aged 65 to 70, born respectively before, during and after World War II. With stepwise and lasso penalized logistic regression, random forest and neural networks, we identified the best-performing model for predicting FFP using CHUVâ€™s data recorded within 12 months prior to frailty assessments. 
ResultsAmong Lc65+ participants, 1649 were assessed for frailty and hospitalized at least once during the follow-up period, resulting in 3499 FFP assessments of which 544 were preceded by at least one hospitalization within 12 months. Â In total, 45.7% of the participants were men and 9.4% were frail (FFP score â‰¥ 3). As expected, prevalence of frailty increased with age from 4.1% in the 66-70 age group, to 5.3% and 10.5% in the 71-75 and 76-80 groups, respectively. Logistic regression with lasso penalty was finally the best model regarding both performance and complexity. It had an area under receiver operating curve of 0.67 to predict FFP based on detailed diagnosis and procedure codes. 
Conclusion/ImplicationsHospital discharge data may be used to identify frail and non-frail individuals and estimate their prevalence in the Swiss non-institutionalized population. Our predictive model showed limited performance and could be improved. We are currently testing groups of diagnosis and procedure codes, as predictors, instead of detailed ones.",2018,International Journal for Population Data Science

A Hemispheric Approach to African Influences in the Americas,"The subtitle of Andrew Sluyterâ€™s latest book reveals the bookâ€™s main theme and the scope of his research. Looking at the influence of Africans in the establishment and consolidation of cattle herding in New Spain (Mexico), Louisiana, Barbuda, the Pampas (Argentina and Uruguay), and Cuba, Sluyter engages with what Jorge CaÃ±izares-Esguerra, in his Puritan Conquistadores: Iberianizing the Atlantic, 1550â€“1700 (2006), calls a hemispheric approach. At the same time, Sluyter explores the Atlantic connections that made cattle herding an area influenced by African skills and ideas ranging from casting lasso to â€œbottomless bucketsâ€ (a water-hoisting device). This is an important book that engages with the recent historiographical debate on the African contribution not only to the culture of societies in the Americas but also to knowledge, technology, and diet. Here the role of Africans and their descendants is not limited to music genres such as jazz, or festivals such as carnival or candombe, but is seen as a constitutive part of colonial economies and societies. As Sluyter states: â€œProduction systems were so fundamental to the environment and social relations of the colonies that their consequences persist to the presentâ€ (p. 2). Sluyterâ€™s contribution will be regarded as a work as influential as Jane Landerâ€™s Black Society in Spanish Florida (1999); Judith Carneyâ€™s Black Rice: The African Origins of Rice Cultivation in the Americas (2001); or Walther Hawthorneâ€™s From Africa to Brazil: Culture, Identity, and the Atlantic Slave Trade, 1600â€“1830 (2011). His argument is that some Africans, mainly from the Senegambia region in Africa, were familiar with cattle raising and herding skills in their homelands. When enslaved, they transferred their knowledge, as well as adapted it, to the local circumstances they encountered in new territories. African influences are more visible in some cases than in others, such as the establishment of cattle ranching in sixteenth-century Mexico or the use of rock-walled stock wells in Barbuda. In Veracruz, for example, ship records and parish records reveal the large number of Senegambian slaves there in the sixteenth century.",2013,Reviews in American History

Rare Presentation of Eagleâ€™s Syndrome as Bellâ€™s Palsy (P7.023),"BACKGROUND: 
Eagle9s Syndrome is caused by elongated styloid process or ossification of the derivations of the second brachial arch, resulting in cervical, facial, and pharyngeal pain and dysphagia. It is usually diagnosed by clinical history and confirmed with imaging study. Bellâ€™s palsy as a presentation of Eagle syndrome is rare and has not been reported thus far.
 OBJECTIVE: 
We describe a case of Eagleâ€™s Syndrome presenting as Bellâ€™s palsy and glossopharyngeal neuralgia
 CASE: 
40 year old male who presented to the Emergency Department with a 1 day history of left sided facial weakness. He had a 1 year history of odynophagia with one episode of excruciating left side neck pain which resolved with NSAIDs. At presentation to the ED, there was significant flattening of the left forehead and nasolabial fold, and sagging mouth corner. There was no sensory disturbance over the ear. He denied otalgia, dysgeusia or dysacusis. CT of the neck with contrast showed a calcified left stylohyoid ligament. The brain MRI showed mild ill-defined enhancement at the left stylomastoid foramen and at the lateral soft tissues adjacent to the proximal styloid process (Images 1 and 2). Given the clinical presentation of the left sided glossopharyngeal neuralgia, Bellâ€™s palsy and the calcified stylohyoid ligament on imagning, the patient was diagnosed with Eagleâ€™s Syndrome. He was treated with steroids and the Bellâ€™s palsy improved over the weeks. Left styloid process resection was performed without complications.
 CONCLUSIONS: 
Our patient presented initially with glassopharyngeal neuralgia and later developed Bellâ€™s palsy. Involvement of the facial nerve can be explained by irritation of the extra-temporal part of the facial nerve by the calfied ligament, when it comes out from the styloidmastoid foramen. Further absence of dry mouth, otalgia, dysgeusia, dysacusis and no sensory disturbance over the ear suggest involvement of extra-temporal component of facial nerve.

A New Sparse LSSVM Method Based the Revised LARS,"Least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) has comparable performance with support vector machine (SVM) and it has been widely used for classification and regression problems. The solutions of LSSVM are obtained by solving linear equations, but it lack of sparseness, which result in that it is unable to handle large-scale data sets. The state-of-art method least angle regression (LARS) can obtain a sparse solution by solving the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) problem. So we use the idea of the LARS to obtain the sparse solution of the LSSVM, i.e., RLARS-LSSVM is proposed, which is an efficient method. The feature of the method is to select the most important samples as support vectors iteratively and to remove the samples that are similar to the selected support vectors simultaneously. Experimental results show that the proposed method can obtain much higher test accuracy compared with other sparse LSSVM methods at the same number of support vectors.",2017,2017 International Conference on Machine Vision and Information Technology (CMVIT)
The Smooth-Lasso and other $\ell_1+\ell_2$-penalized methods,"We consider a linear regression problem in a high dimensional setting where the number of covariates $p$ can be much larger than the sample size $n$. In such a situation, one often assumes sparsity of the regression vector, \textit{i.e.}, the regression vector contains many zero components. We propose a Lasso-type estimator $\hat{\beta}^{Quad}$ (where '$Quad$' stands for quadratic) which is based on two penalty terms. The first one is the $\ell_1$ norm of the regression coefficients used to exploit the sparsity of the regression as done by the Lasso estimator, whereas the second is a quadratic penalty term introduced to capture some additional information on the setting of the problem. We detail two special cases: the Elastic-Net $\hat{\beta}^{EN}$, which deals with sparse problems where correlations between variables may exist; and the Smooth-Lasso $\hat{\beta}^{SL}$, which responds to sparse problems where successive regression coefficients are known to vary slowly (in some situations, this can also be interpreted in terms of correlations between successive variables). From a theoretical point of view, we establish variable selection consistency results and show that $\hat{\beta}^{Quad}$ achieves a Sparsity Inequality, \textit{i.e.}, a bound in terms of the number of non-zero components of the 'true' regression vector. These results are provided under a weaker assumption on the Gram matrix than the one used by the Lasso. In some situations this guarantees a significant improvement over the Lasso. Furthermore, a simulation study is conducted and shows that the S-Lasso $\hat{\beta}^{SL}$ performs better than known methods as the Lasso, the Elastic-Net $\hat{\beta}^{EN}$, and the Fused-Lasso with respect to the estimation accuracy. This is especially the case when the regression vector is 'smooth', \textit{i.e.}, when the variations between successive coefficients of the unknown parameter of the regression are small. The study also reveals that the theoretical calibration of the tuning parameters and the one based on $10$ fold cross validation imply two S-Lasso solutions with close performance.",2011,arXiv: Statistics Theory
The Application of Multi-Locus GWAS for the Detection of Salt-Tolerance Loci in Rice,"Improving the salt-tolerance of direct-seeding rice at the seed germination stage is a major goal of breeders. Efficiently identifying salt tolerance loci will help researchers develop effective rice breeding strategies. In this study, six multi-locus genome-wide association studies (GWAS) methods (mrMLM, FASTmrMLM, FASTmrEMMA, pLARmEB, pKWmEB, and ISIS EM-BLASSO) were applied to identify quantitative trait nucleotides (QTNs) for the salt tolerance traits of 478 rice accessions with 162,529 SNPs at the seed germination stage. Among the 371 QTNs detected by the six methods, 56 were identified by at least three methods. Among these 56 QTNs, 12, 6, 7, 4, 13, 12, and 12 were found to be associated with SSI-GI, SSI-VI, SSI-MGT, SSI-IR-24h, SSI-IR-48h, SSI-GR-5d, and SSI-GR-10d, respectively. Additionally, 66 candidate genes were identified in the vicinity of the 56 QTNs, and two of these genes (LOC_Os01g45760 and LOC_Os10g04860) are involved in auxin biosynthesis according to the enriched GO terms and KEGG pathways. This information will be useful for identifying the genes responsible for rice salt tolerance. A comparison of the six methods revealed that ISIS EM-BLASSO identified the most co-detected QTNs and performed best, with the smallest residual errors and highest computing speed, followed by FASTmrMLM, pLARmEB, mrMLM, pKWmEB, and FASTmrEMMA. Although multi-locus GWAS methods are superior to single-locus GWAS methods, their utility for identifying QTNs may be enhanced by adding a bin analysis to the models or by developing a hybrid method that merges the results from different methods.",2018,Frontiers in Plant Science
Ozone-precursor relationships from EKMA diagrams. Reply to comments.,"S IR The regression and rollback equations presented in my note ( I ) were stated to be approximate and valid only within specified constraints of concentrations and NMHC/NO, ratios. These will be called â€œtransition ratiosâ€ in this response to the comments by Kumar. Kumar acknowledged that the rollback equation had been stated to be applicable only within the specified constraints. Yet in his calculations he disregards the constraints and therefore incorrectly concludes that the equations are suspect and always overestimate the NMHC reductions. Of the 27 examples in Table I of Kumarâ€™s comments, only two were in compliance with the constraints. For the two valid cases, the hydrocarbon reductions calculated by the rollback equation were within 10 and 15% of those determined by Kumar by using the standard EKMA diagram. The 15% difference of the hydrocarbon reduction corresponds to an equivalent difference of about 0.01 ppm ozone at the O,, level. This amount is within the realm of the term â€œapproximateâ€. As stated by Kumar the equations do not allow for NO, inhibition of ozone production under any condition. The equations apply only within the transition ratios where ozone is a function of P1f2. They do not apply below the lower transition ratio where NO2 inhibition occurs. Nor do the equations apply above the upper transition ratio where ozone depends mainly on the NO, concentration. None of the examples or comments by Kumar addressed the area near or above the upper transition ratio, which is about 20 based on the standard EKMA diagram. Kumar also stated that when NMHC and NO, reductions are introduced, the resulting NMHC/NO, ratios generally are below the lower limit of the range of validity (below the lower transition ratio) of the regression equation. Obviously this was true for 25 of his 27 examples. However, the lower transition ratio will not be reached when the hydrocarbon control required is moderate and the initial ratio is high. It will not be reached when the control requirements are substantial, but the reductions of hydrocarbons and NO, are commensurate or nearly so. As stated in the note, the transition ratios differ depending on environmental chamber conditions and other factors, but to my knowledge the reason or cause of the differences has not been satisfactorily explained. Subsequent to publication of the note, a recent article by Spicer was reviewed to determine the transition ratios based on his environmental chamber study results (2). Within an ozone concentration range of 0.23-0.35 ppm the transition ratios appeared to be about 10 and 25. These are higher than those reported in the note. Glassonâ€™s environmental chamber data were reviewed for the same purpose (3). On the basis of his data, the transition ratios appeared to be about 25 and 50 within an ozone concentration range of from 0.10 to 0.25 ppm. It was not possible to determine the ratios accurately because the number of data points from Glassonâ€™s studies were limited, as were those from Spicerâ€™s studies. Thus the transition ratios determined from results of various chamber studies differ considerably, and these differences raise questions as to which if any transition ratio values are applicable to urban atmospheric situations. The lack of reliable ambient air NMHC data has hindered the determination of ozone-precursor relationships in the ambient air. However during a number of summer days in 1976 and 1977, reliable speciated hydrocarbon measurements were made in the ambient air a t Los Angeles from 6:OO to 9:00 a.m. PDT (4, 5) . Los Angeles precusor-Pasadena ozone relationships were developed by using this data and indicate the following: (1) The daily maximum ozone concentration at Pasadena correlates well with the 6:OO-9:00 a.m. P112 concentrations at Los Angeles. With a sample number of 36, the ozone-precursor correlation coefficient was 0.70 and is highly significant. (2) The mean NMHC/NO, ratio was 8.7, and the range was 5.3-14.3. The correlation coefficient of ozone as a function of the ratios was -0.02, and the ozone scatter was reasonably uniform throughout the range of the NMHC/NO, ratios. Thus, there is no indication of NO2 inhibition on ozone formation in the ambient air of the Los Angeles area. If inhibition occurs in urban atmospheres, it does so at ratios below 5.3.",1983,Environmental science & technology
Meiobenthos and nematode assemblages from different deep-sea habitats of the Strait of Sicily (Central Mediterranean Sea),"Much attention is currently devoted at upgrading our knowledge on biodiversity and functioning of deep water ecosystems. Information is constantly enriched by researchers, even from basins as the long-studied Mediterranean Sea. In such a perspective, we studied meiobenthic and nematode communities inhabiting muddy sediments from three different habitats at bathyal depths in the Strait of Sicily: a cold-water coral site (CS) in the Maltese Coral Province, a muddy bottom in the same area (MS), and a hydrocarbon imprinted pockmark site (PS) in the Gela Basin. The average meiofauna density at CS (1343 ind/10 cm 2 ) and MS (1804 ind/10 cm 2 ) is much higher than that reported in literature for similar habitats; it is also markedly more elevated than that recorded at PS (224 ind/10 cm 2 ). Although nematodes of the three sites show different abundances, they share similar assemblage structure. Nematodes (avg. 86%) and copepods (avg. 9.3%) were the most abundant meiofaunal taxa at all sites followed by annelids, kinorhynchs and turbellarians. Nematodes were composed by 21 families and 46 genera, with Terschellingia , as most abundant genus (12.4%), followed by Microlaimus (11%), Daptonema (11%), Thalassomonhystera (10.8%), Acantholaimus (9.5%) and Sabatieria (8.7%). The genera Thalassomonhystera , Terschellingia, Microlaimus , Daptonema , Chromadorita , Sabatieria , and Anticoma display a dominance in at least one station. The taxonomic structure of meiofaunal communities of the studied sites is rather similar but differences in relative abundance are evident.",2015,Mediterranean Marine Science

Efficient modeling and forecasting of electricity spot prices,"The increasing importance of renewable energy, especially solar and wind power, has led to new forces in the formation of electricity prices. Hence, this paper introduces an econometric model for the hourly time series of electricity prices of the European Power Exchange (EPEX) which incorporates specific features like renewable energy. The model consists of several sophisticated and established approaches and can be regarded as a periodic VAR-TARCH with wind power, solar power, and load as influences on the time series. It is able to map the distinct and well-known features of electricity prices in Germany. An efficient iteratively reweighted lasso approach is used for the estimation. Moreover, it is shown that several existing models are outperformed by the procedure developed in this paper.",2015,Energy Economics
A Point-Mass Mixture Random Effects Model for Pitching Metrics,"A plethora of statistics have been proposed to measure the effectiveness of pitchers in Major League Baseball. While many of these are quite traditional (e.g., ERA, wins), some have gained currency only recently (e.g., WHIP, K/BB). Some of these metrics may have predictive power, but it is unclear which are the most reliable or consistent. We address this question by constructing a Bayesian random effects model that incorporates a point mass mixture and fitting it to data on twenty metrics spanning approximately 2,500 players and 35 years. Our model identifies FIP, HR/9, ERA, and BB/9 as the highest signal metrics for starters and GB%, FB%, and K/9 as the highest signal metrics for relievers. In general, the metrics identified by our model are independent of team defense. Our procedure also provides a relative ranking of metrics separately by starters and relievers and shows that these rankings differ quite substantially between them. Our methodology is compared to a Lasso-based procedure and is internally validated by detailed case studies.",2010,Journal of Quantitative Analysis in Sports

A variable selection approach in the multivariate linear model: an application to LC-MS metabolomics data,Abstract Omic data are characterized by the presence of strong dependence structures that result either from data acquisition or from some underlying biological processes. Applying statistical procedures that do not adjust the variable selection step to the dependence pattern may result in a loss of power and the selection of spurious variables. The goal of this paper is to propose a variable selection procedure within the multivariate linear model framework that accounts for the dependence between the multiple responses. We shall focus on a specific type of dependence which consists in assuming that the responses of a given individual can be modelled as a time series. We propose a novel Lasso-based approach within the framework of the multivariate linear model taking into account the dependence structure by using different types of stationary processes covariance structures for the random error matrix. Our numerical experiments show that including the estimation of the covariance matrix of the random error matrix in the Lasso criterion dramatically improves the variable selection performance. Our approach is successfully applied to an untargeted LC-MS (Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry) data set made of African copals samples. Our methodology is implemented in the R package MultiVarSel which is available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).,2018,Statistical Applications in Genetics and Molecular Biology
Network Reconstruction of Dynamic Biological Systems,"Inference of network topology from experimental data is a central endeavor in biology, since knowledge of the underlying signaling mechanisms a requirement for understanding biological phenomena. As one of the most important tools in bioinformatics area, development of methods to reconstruct biological networks has attracted remarkable attention in the current decade. Integration of different data types can lead to remarkable improvements in our ability to identify the connectivity of different segments of networks and to predict events within a cellular system. Several recent studies used data integration to reconstruct biochemical networks and to build predictive models from large-scale datasets. In this dissertation we first prescribe directions to reconstruct biological networks based on data properties and priorities in terms of network reconstruction performance. We use experimentally measured and synthetic data sets to compare three popular methods--principal component regression (PCR), linear matrix inequalities (LMI), and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO)-- in terms of root-mean-squared-error (RMSE), average fractional error in the value of the coefficients, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and the geometric mean of sensitivity and specificity. This comparison enables us to establish criteria for selection of an appropriate approach for network reconstruction based on a priori properties of experimental data. Reconstruction of biological and biochemical networks from large biological datasets is challenging when the data in question are dynamic. To contribute to this challenge, we also developed a new method, called Doubly Penalized Linear Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (DPLASSO), for reconstruction of dynamic biological networks. DPLASSO consists of two components, statistical significance testing of model coefficients and penalized/constrained optimization. A partial least squares with statistical significance testing acts as a supervisory-level filter to extract the most informative components of the network from a dataset (Layer 1). Then, LASSO with extra weights on the smaller parameters identified in the first layer is employed to retain the main predictors and to set the smallest coefficients to zero (Layer 2). We illustrate that DPLASSO outperforms LASSO in terms of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. Most of biological systems are nonlinear, therefore, expressing the network model in linear form may not be able to appropriately represent the real structure of the network or to predict the response of the network as accurately as a proper nonlinear model does. Accordingly, as another contribution we have introduced a novel method to reconstruct nonlinear biological networks. In this method, we use a quadratic nonlinear model as the representation of second-order Taylor series expansion of a nonlinear system around an arbitrary point of interest. We apply LASSO to shrink some of the small coefficients to zero. A statistical significance testing (t-test) will complete the parameter (network link) selection. We demonstrate that our proposed approach will lead to considerable improvements in predicting the response of the system and fair improvement in accuracy and sensitivity of the network identified",2013,
Selection of NARX models estimated using weighted least squares method via GIC-based method and l1-norm regularization methods,"We investigate the model selection problem for nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous variables models estimated using the weighted least squares (WLS) method. Because WLS changes the statistical property of data under study and violates the assumptions imposed on the well-developed model evaluation and selection methods (e.g. Akaikeâ€™s information criterion, Schwarzâ€™s Bayesian information criterion, and the error reduction ratio based methods), therefore, new approaches should be investigated. In this research, an information criterion based method and two l1-norm regularization methods are taken into consideration: (a) in the former method, for models estimated using WLS, we first derive an information criterion in terms of the generalized information criterion (GIC, proposed by Konishi and Kitagawa in Biometrica 83(4):875â€“890, 1996), which is a theoretical framework for the analysis and extension of information criteria via a statistical functional approach. Then we develop a robust selection procedure by combining the GIC-based forward stepwise method with Subsampling; (b)Â in the latter two methods, we employ the l1-norm regularization methods, including Lasso and adaptive Lasso, to select models estimated with WLS. Finally, a numerical example is given to test and compare the performance of the three methods.",2012,Nonlinear Dynamics

Bayesian Fusion Estimation via t-Shrinkage,"Shrinkage prior has gained great successes in many data analysis, however, its applications mostly focus on the Bayesian modeling of sparse parameters. In this work, we will apply Bayesian shrinkage to model high dimensional parameter that possesses an unknown blocking structure. We propose to impose heavy-tail shrinkage prior, e.g., $t$ prior, on the differences of successive parameter entries, and such a fusion prior will shrink successive differences towards zero and hence induce posterior blocking. Comparing to conventional Bayesian fused lasso which implements Laplace fusion prior, $t$ fusion prior induces stronger shrinkage effect and enjoys a nice posterior consistency property. Simulation studies and real data analyses show that $t$ fusion has superior performance to the frequentist fusion estimator and Bayesian Laplace-fusion prior. This $t$-fusion strategy is further developed to conduct a Bayesian clustering analysis, and simulation shows that the proposed algorithm obtains better posterior distributional convergence than the classical Dirichlet process modeling.",2018,arXiv: Methodology
Estimating the global burden of thalassogenic diseases: human infectious diseases caused by wastewater pollution of the marine environment.,"This paper presents a preliminary attempt at obtaining an order-of-magnitude estimate of the global burden of disease (GBD) of human infectious diseases associated with swimming/bathing in coastal waters polluted by wastewater, and eating raw or lightly steamed filter-feeding shellfish harvested from such waters. Such diseases will be termed thalassogenic--caused by the sea. Until recently these human health effects have been viewed primarily as local phenomena, not generally included in the world agenda of marine scientists dealing with global marine pollution problems. The massive global scale of the problem can be visualized when one considers that the wastewater and human body wastes of a significant portion of the world's population who reside along the coastline or in the vicinity of the sea are discharged daily, directly or indirectly, into the marine coastal waters, much of it with little or no treatment. Every cubic metre of raw domestic wastewater discharged into the sea can carry millions of infectious doses of pathogenic microorganisms. It is estimated that globally, foreign and local tourists together spend some 2 billion man-days annually at coastal recreational resorts and many are often exposed there to coastal waters polluted by wastewater. Annually some 800 million meals of potentially contaminated filter-feeding shellfish/bivalves and other sea foods, harvested in polluted waters are consumed, much of it raw or lightly steamed. A number of scientific studies have shown that swimmers swallow significant amounts of polluted seawater and can become ill with gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases from the pathogens they ingest. Based on risk assessments from the World Health Organization (WHO) and academic research sources the present study has made an estimate that globally, each year, there are in excess of 120 million cases of gastrointestinal disease and in excess of 50 million cases of more severe respiratory diseases caused by swimming and bathing in wastewater-polluted coastal waters. Filter-feeding shellfish/bivalves, which are often harvested from wastewater-polluted areas of the sea, can effectively filter out and concentrate the microbial pathogens in the seawater. It can be roughly estimated that annually there are some 4 million cases of infectious hepatitis A and E (HAV/HEV), with some 40 thousand deaths and 40 thousand cases of long-term disability, mainly chronic liver damage, from consuming raw or lightly steamed filter-feeding shellfish/molluscs harvested globally from polluted coastal waters. The total global health impact of the thalassogenic diseases--human infectious diseases associated with pathogenic microorganisms from land-based wastewater pollution of the seas--is estimated to be about 3 million 'disability-adjusted life years' (DALY)/year, with an estimated economic loss of some 12 billion dollars per year. Due to the preliminary nature of the estimates in this study it is appropriate to assume that all of the above figures are no more than first approximations and that the true figures may be 50% higher or lower. Nevertheless, it is the author's belief that this study indicates that wastewater pollution of the sea results in a multi-billion dollar per year health burden and that preventing wastewater pollution of the sea is worthy of inclusion on the global agenda of marine pollution prevention and control.",2003,Journal of water and health
Sex change in a coral-reef fish: dependence of stimulation and inhibition on relative size.,"The removal of a single dominant individual has been shown to trigger a sex change in some coral-reeffish. In the saddleback wrasse (Thalassoma duperrey), however, female-to-male sex change requires visual stimulation from smaller conspecifics. This change is not dependent on the sex or color of the stimulus fish and can be inhibited by larger conspecifics. On the reef, a female probably changes sex when the relative numbers of larger and smaller conspecifics change within her home range.",1983,Science
On lasso for censored data,"In this paper, we propose a new lasso-type estimator for cen- sored data after one-step em update. While several penalized likelihood estimators have been proposed for censored data variable selection through hazards regression, many such estimators require parametric or propor- tional hazards assumptions. The proposed estimator, on the other hand, is based on the linear model and least-squares principles. Penalized Buckley- James estimators are also popular in this setting but have been shown to be unstable and unreliable. Unlike path-based learning based on least- squares approximation, our method requires no covariance assumption and the method is valid for even modest sample sizes. Our calibration estima- tor is equivalent to the minimizer of a well-defined convex loss function and, thus, yields an exact regularized solution path.

Variable selection for functional regression models via the L1 regularization,"In regression analysis, L1 regularizations such as the lasso or the SCAD provide sparse solutions, which leads to variable selection. We consider the variable selection problem where variables are given as functional forms, using L1 regularization. In order to select functional variables each of which is controlled by multiple parameters, we treat parameters as grouped parameters and then apply the group SCAD. A crucial issue in the regularization method is the choice of regularization parameters. We derive a model selection criterion for evaluating the model estimated by the regularization method via the group SCAD penalty. Results of simulation and real data analysis show the effectiveness of the proposed modeling strategy.",2011,Comput. Stat. Data Anal.

Genome Mining of the Marine Actinomycete Streptomyces sp. DUT11 and Discovery of Tunicamycins as Anti-complement Agents,"Marine actinobacteria are potential producers of various secondary metabolites with diverse bioactivities. Among various bioactive compounds, anti-complement agents have received great interest for drug discovery to treat numerous diseases caused by inappropriate activation of the human complement system. However, marine streptomycetes producing anti-complement agents are still poorly explored. In this study, a marine-derived strain Streptomyces sp. DUT11 showing superior anti-complement activity was focused, and its genome sequence was analyzed. Gene clusters showing high similarities to that of tunicamycin and nonactin were identified, and their corresponding metabolites were also detected. Subsequently, tunicamycin I, V, and VII were isolated from Streptomyces sp. DUT11. Anti-complement assay showed that tunicamycin I, V, VII inhibited complement activation through the classic pathway, whereas no anti-complement activity of nonactin was detected. This is the first time that tunicamycins are reported to have such activity. In addition, genome analysis indicates that Streptomyces sp. DUT11 has the potential to produce novel lassopeptides and lantibiotics. These results suggest that marine Streptomyces are rich sources of anti-complement agents for drug discovery.",2018,Frontiers in Microbiology
Fluorescence Molecular Tomography Based on Group Sparsity Priori for Morphological Reconstruction of Glioma,"Objective: Fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT) is an important tool for life science, which can noninvasive real-time three-dimensional (3-D) visualization for fluorescence source location. FMT is widely used in tumor research due to its high-sensitive and low cost. However, the reconstruction of FMT is difficult. Although the reconstruction methods of FMT have developed rapidly in recent years, the morphological reconstruction of FMT is still a challenge problem. Thus, the purpose of this study is to realize the morphological reconstruction performance of FMT in glioma research. Methods: In this study, group sparsity was used as a new priori information for FMT. Besides sparsity, group sparsity also takes the group structure of the fluorescent sources, which can maintain the morphological information of the sources. Fused LASSO method (FLM) was proved it can efficiently model the group sparsity prior. Thus, we utilize FLM to reconstruct the morphological information of glioma. Furthermore, to reduce the influence of the high scattering of skull, we modified the FLM for improving the accuracy of morphological reconstruction. Results: Glioma numerical simulation model and in vivo glioma model were established to evaluate the performance of morphological reconstruction of the proposed method. The results demonstrated that the proposed method was efficient to reconstruct the morphological information of glioma. Conclusion: Group sparsity priori can effectively improve the morphological accuracy of FMT reconstruction. Significance: Group sparsity can maintain the morphological information of fluorescent sources effectively, which has great application potential in FMT. The group sparsity based methods can realize the morphological reconstruction, which is of great practical significance in tumor research.",2020,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering
BNrich: A Bayesian network approach to the pathway enrichment analysis,"Motivation One of the most popular techniques in biological studies for analyzing high throughput data is pathway enrichment analysis (PEA). Many researchers apply the existing methods without considering the topology of pathways or at least they have overlooked a significant part of the structure, which may reduce the accuracy and generalizability of the results. Developing a new approach while considering gene expression data and topological features like causal relations regarding edge directions will help the investigators to achieve more accurate results. Results We proposed a new pathway enrichment analysis based on Bayesian network (BNrich) as an approach in PEA. To this end, the cycles were eliminated in 187 KEGG human signaling pathways concerning intuitive biological rules and the Bayesian network structures were constructed. The constructed networks were simplified by the Least Absolute Shrinkage Selector Operator (LASSO), and their parameters were estimated using the gene expression data. We finally prioritize the impacted pathways by Fisherâ€™s Exact Test on significant parameters. Our method integrates both edge and node related parameters to enrich modules in the affected signaling pathway network. In order to evaluate the proposed method, consistency, discrimination, false positive rate and empirical P-value criteria were calculated, and the results are compared to well-known enrichment methods such as signaling pathway impact analysis (SPIA), bi-level meta-analysis (BLMA) and topology-based pathway enrichment analysis (TPEA).

The presence of nitrate- and sulfate-reducing bacteria contributes to ineffectiveness souring control by nitrate injection,"Abstract Nitrate injection has been widely used to minimize the production of biological hydrogen sulfide in oil and gas field industry, by controlling the growth of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) chemically and biologically. This study aimed to investigate the changes in the bacterial community in response to nitrate addition used to control biological souring. Specifically, we examined the effect of nitrate addition in an artificial souring experiment, using diluted crude oil as substrate and electron donor. Desulfotignum sp. was the predominant SRB under all conditions tested. Addition of nitrate at the beginning (N 0 ) repressed the growth of SRB, as revealed by chemical and bacterial community analysis, concomitant with significant growth of the nitrate-reducing bacteria (NRB) Thalassospira sp. Nitrate addition after SRB growth (at day 28, N 28 ) successfully remediated the sulfide produced by SRB, but no significant reduction in sulfate was observed subsequently; moreover, the bacterial communities before and after nitrate addition remained identical. Isolation of Desulfotignum YB01 (D. YB01) proved the resistance of this predominant SRB in high nitrate environment. Simultaneous reduction of sulfate and nitrate by D. YB01 was also observed in this study. Therefore, the phenomenon in the N 28 experiment might be the result of the role of Arcobacter sp. which are nitrate-reducing sulfide-oxidizing bacteria, and/or the ability of Desulfotignum sp. to reduce nitrate and/or nitrite as a stress response. Thus, SRB might persist after nitrate addition, potentially causing subsequent SRB outbreaks.",2018,International Biodeterioration & Biodegradation

StabilitÃ  di archi e volte in muratura: metodi tradizionali e calcolo automatico,"Lï¿½articolo affronta il tema dellï¿½analisi degli archi e delle volte in muratura collocate allï¿½interno di complessi edilizi, e introduce alcune procedure per lo studio della stabilita che possono anche essere convenientemente usate per valutarne il grado di stabilita ed, equivalentemente, il livello di vulnerabilita in funzione di una possibile variazione delle azioni esterne, dovute ora ad una variazione della destinazione dï¿½uso dellï¿½edificio, ora a cedimenti fondali o delle imposte, ora ad azioni sismiche. Tali procedure sono applicabili sia nei problemi di verifica che in quelli di nuova progettazione.

Surfing the Tide: Cross-cultural Indian Ocean Identities in the Work of Lindsey Collen,"Recent directions in the Indian Ocean Studies emphasize the connectedness and dynamism inherent to the region.

Glissantian key concepts of creolization, cross-culturality, hybridity, and diversity are essential to this discussion, as Collenâ€™s work can be read as an illustration of the entanglements inherent to the Mauritian identities, histories, and memories. This paper will examine the literary devices used by Collen to illustrate this Indian Oceanic idea of shifting and fluctuating multiple identities.

"Comment on Hu et al , page 2715 CD 30 , another useful predictor of survival in DLBCL ?","DLBCL is the most common type of nonHodgkin lymphoma, and with modern immunochemotherapy, more than half of patients are cured. DLBCL is in fact a heterogeneity entity, and it can be divided into subgroups that are biologically and clinically distinct; however, even within these subgroups, there is still marked biological and clinical heterogeneity. One of the most consistent predictors of outcome is the International Prognostic Index (IPI) with a proposed revision to R-IPI for patients treated with Rituximab, cyclophosphamide, Hydroxydaunorubicin, Oncovin (Vincristine), Prednisone, R-CHOP. Many attempts have been made to find biomarkers that can improve our outcome prediction beyond the IPI. However, the literature has been littered with numerous prognostic markers, especially single markers that additional studies have failed to validate. Many factors contribute to the inconsistency of the findings. One major factor relates to the assay used, which may not be sufficiently robust or standardized to be readily reproducible. Biomarkers are frequently assayed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) on formalinfixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. The tissues are often not processed uniformly, and the IHC assays are generally not standardized regarding the antibodies used, the antigen retrieval methods, the detection system, and the instruments employed. The scoring is usually subjective, and diverse criteria are used by different investigators. Another problem is the heterogeneity of the patient population included in the different studies that were also frequently underpowered for analysis. The influence of the targeted population on the results obtained is illustrated by the different prognostic implication of BCL2 expression between the germinal center B-cellâ€“like (GCB) and activated B-cellâ€“like (ABC) subtypes of DLBCL: in the pre-rituximab era, BCL2 predicts for worse survival in the ABC, but not in the GCB, subtype, whereas with the addition of rituximab, the reverse is true. Studying BCL2 without taking the GCB/ABC subtypes into consideration may produce inconsistent findings. Another important consideration is the complexity of the biological system. Tumor behavior is influenced by multiple factors, and the study of a single marker does not take into consideration other important modifiers. This is illustrated by a recent study that examined the expression of both MYC and BCL2 in DLBCL and demonstrated the importance of assaying both parameters for outcome prediction. Even with both markers included, there are layers of complexity that needed to be further explored. Not all MYCs are created equal, and it has been demonstrated that MYC with T58A mutation is a more potent oncogene. The mutant is associated with diminished activation of BCL2-like Protein 11, and can give rise to tumors without p19ARF and TP53 inactivation in a murine model. Thus, adding MYC mutation analysis may make the MYC/BCL2 model more robust. Although abnormalities in the tumor are important, we must not forget the important role of host/tumor interactions. Gene expression signatures derived from the microenvironment have been shown to be predictive of outcome, whereas abnormal expression of major histocompatibility complex molecules may impair immune surveillance and thus contribute to poorer survival. In this issue of Blood, Hu and coworkers reported from the retrospective study of a large series of DLCBL that expression of CD30 by the lymphoma cells is associated with better outcome in patients treated with R-CHOP therapy (see figure). CD30 expression is a hallmark of T/null anaplastic large cell lymphoma, T/natural killer cell lymphoma, nasal type, and Hodgkin lymphoma, but it may also be expressed in DLBCL including B anaplastic large cell lymphoma, primary mediastinal large cell lymphoma (PMBCL), and DLBCLassociated Epstein-Barr virus infection. The authors appropriately excluded the latter 2 categories from this study. They also examined the impact of some possible confounding variables such as GCB vs ABC subtype and MYC and BCL2 alterations on the findings of this study. In such a multiinstitutional, retrospective study, it is not likely that patients would be treated entirely uniformly, but the large number of cases studied added credibility to the findings. CD30 (TNFRSF8) belongs to the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily. Its role in DLBCL is unclear, and the mechanistic basis for its association with better prognosis remains to be defined. Gene expression profiling (GEP) suggested differences in a number of pathways between the CD30positive and CD30-negative groups and may",2013,
Sparse Recovery of Intermittent Frequency Hopping Signals Aided by DOA,"Radio frequency sources with frequency hopping (FH) are observed at a fusion center via sensor measurements made over additive white Gaussian noise channels. The number of sources may be larger than the number of sensors, but their activity is sparse and intermittent with bursty transmission patterns accounted for by hidden Markov models. Blind source estimation of intermittent FH signals is solved via a proposed algorithm, consisting of a direction of arrival (DOA) estimation step, an FH estimation step, and a pairing step. The DOA estimation step is achieved by merging the FH effect and the complex amplitude of the signal, and FH estimation step is completed by estimating likewise by merging the DOA effect and the complex amplitude of the signal. After DOA and FH are estimated, a crucial procedure of pairing is operated by picking a pair of estimated DOA and estimated FH patterns that provides the best fit to the data at each time sample over all possible pairs. To this end, a smooth least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm is integrated with DOA and FH estimation steps, while a standard LASSO algorithm is utilized for pairing step. It is shown that the proposed algorithm can separate FH signals with high accuracy and the pairing step can effectively eliminate false alarms during previous DOA and FH estimation steps.",2020,2020 54th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)
Whiteout: Gaussian Adaptive Noise Regularization in Deep Neural Networks.,"Noise injection (NI) is an efficient technique to mitigate over-fitting in neural networks (NNs). The Bernoulli NI procedure as implemented in dropout and shakeout has connections with $l_1$ and $l_2$ regularization for the NN model parameters. We propose whiteout, a family NI regularization techniques (NIRT) through injecting adaptive Gaussian noises during the training of NNs. Whiteout is the first NIRT than imposes a broad range of the $l_{\gamma}$ sparsity regularization $(\gamma\in(0,2))$ without having to involving the $l_2$ regularization. Whiteout can also be extended to offer regularizations similar to the adaptive lasso and group lasso. We establish the regularization effect of whiteout in the framework of generalized linear models with closed-form penalty terms and show that whiteout stabilizes the training of NNs with decreased sensitivity to small perturbations in the input. We establish that the noise-perturbed empirical loss function (pelf) with whiteout converges almost surely to the ideal loss function (ilf), and the minimizer of the pelf is consistent for the minimizer of the ilf. We derive the tail bound on the pelf to establish the practical feasibility in its minimization. The superiority of whiteout over the Bernoulli NIRTs, dropout and shakeout, in learning NNs with relatively small-sized training sets and non-inferiority in large-sized training sets is demonstrated in both simulated and real-life data sets. This work represents the first in-depth theoretical, methodological, and practical examination of the regularization effects of both additive and multiplicative Gaussian NI in deep NNs.",2016,arXiv: Machine Learning

"Review Article: Cadute, riprese e la critica militante","Da tempo, il dibattito sullo stato del cinema italiano ci ha abituato a valutazioni dai toni a dir poco apocalittici che tendono a riconoscere negli anni Settanta lâ€™inizio di un periodo di torpore morale ed intellettuale. Lino Micciche nota in quegli anni lâ€™avviarsi di un processo di deterioramento qualitativo della produzione cinematografica nazionale che sfocera nel baratro degli anni Ottanta e Novanta. Per Micciche, il quadro degli anni Settanta e paragonabile ad â€˜una palude stagnante dove pigri nocchieri seduti su barche ammuffite di muschio palustre attendono, senza neppure troppa convinzione, che irrompa una corrente a smuovere le acque ormai limacciose e metificheâ€™.1 In questâ€™ottica polemica, e di solito la morte dei grandi padri del cinema italiano (Visconti, Rossellini, Pasolini e De Sica negli anni Settanta) a segnare, simbolicamente, lâ€™inizio della fine. Visti i toni nostalgici (e un poâ€™ vaghi) coi quali la crisi del cinema italiano viene frequentemente dibattuta, il libro di Barbara Corsi, Con qualche dollaro in meno, rappresenta una innegabile boccata dâ€™aria fresca ed un eccellente contributo alla riflessione critica sullo stato del cinema italiano negli ultimi quarantâ€™anni. Questa storia economica del cinema italiano copre in verita un lasso di tempo piu ampio, che va dal ventennio fascista ai giorni nostri. Il suo merito e quello di fornire un quadro estremamente lucido su alcune delle trasformazioni che porteranno alla grande fuga del pubblico dalle sale dagli anni Settanta in poi. Esaminando le condizioni â€˜materialiâ€™ che accompagnano il passaggio dagli splendori del periodo dâ€™oro (anni Cinquanta e Sessanta) alla crisi degli anni Settanta, Corsi rivela una rigorosa attenzione per i dati e per le statistiche, oltre che unâ€™innegabile competenza nellâ€™analisi dei vari meccanismi legislativi e delle dinamiche produttive e di distribuzione. Lâ€™autrice sostiene che le varie crisi e rinascite del cinema italiano siano storicamente legate allâ€™abilita o meno dellâ€™industria di difendersi dalla concorrenza americana.",2012,Italian Studies
"Multiple defensive roles for bromopyrrole alkaloids from Caribbean Agelas sponges. Proceedings of the 6th International Sponge Conference, Rapallo, Italy, 2002","Previous studies have indicated that Caribbean reef sponges of the common genus Agelas are chemically defended from fish predators by brominated pyrrole alkaloids: Agelas clathrodes and A. wiedenmayeri by 4,5-dibromopyrrole-2-carboxylic acid (1) and oroidin (2), A. conifera by sceptrin (3). In this study, we expand our understanding of chemical defense in this sponge genus to include an extensive HPLC quantification analysis of the defensive metabolites in tissues of A. cerebrum, A. cervicornis, A. dilatata, A. dispar and A. sceptrum. A. cervicornis and A. dispar contained the same two major metabolites as A. clathrodes and A. wiedenmayeri, while A. cerebrum, A. dilatata and A. sceptrum contained a mixture of dimeric bromopyrrole alkaloids dominated by sceptrin, similar to A. conifera. At natural volumetric concentrations, both crude extracts and purified compounds from each species were unpalatable to a common generalist reef fish, Thalassoma bifasciatum, in aquarium assays, and inhibited attachment of the marine bacterium Vibrio harveyi in surface fouling assays.

The Question Concerning the Aims of Moral Education: Meillassouxâ€™s Ethic of Immortality,"In this article, the thesis that moral education is best served through education for irreligious thinking will be put forward. At stake here is the acknowledgment of a disquieting kernel at the deepest level of thinking that is usually glossed over or sedated. I will attempt to confront and articulate this kernel and discuss its repercussions for moral education in reference to the contemporary French philosopher Quentin Meillassouxâ€™s groundbreaking philosophical project articulated in his debut book After Finitude. Stated briefly, the kernel I am referring to concerns the groundlessness of being and the radical ethical attitude it embodies. Two contrasting orientations when confronted with the notion of such an understanding of being can be identified. I will refer to these, simply, as religious and irreligious thinking. My wager is that religious thinking evades the kernel and needs to be overcome by irreligious thinking, which should constitute the aim of moral education.",2017,Interchange

Joint Screening Tests for Lasso,"This paper focusses on â€œsafeâ€ screening techniques for the LASSO problem. Motivated by the need for low-complexity algorithms, we propose a new approach, dubbed â€œjoint screening testâ€, allowing to screen a set of atoms by carrying out one single test. The approach is particularized to two different sets of atoms, respectively expressed as sphere and dome regions. After presenting the mathematical derivations of the tests, we elaborate on their relative effectiveness and discuss the practical use of such procedures.",2018,"2018 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)"
Threatened fishes of the world: Elassoma okatie Rohde and Arndt 1987 (Elassomatidae),"Conservation status: Threatened and protected by state law in North Carolina (NWRC 2004). State threatened in South Carolina (SCDNR 2003). Listed by the Federal Endangered Species Act as a species of concern, as followed by the American Fisheries Society (Williams et al. 1989; NWRC 2004). Internationally recognized as nearly threatened (Gimenez Dixon 1996). Identification: D IV/8-12; A III/5-8; C 14; P1 14-17; P2 I/5; L1 2430; mouth terminal and upturned. Lateral line absent. Sympatric species of pygmy sunfishes have head scales or humeral spots and ocular bars. Elassoma boehlkei normally has 12â€“14 vertical bars along the body, alternating with iridescent interbars of approximately equal width (Rohde and Arndt 1987). In the spawning season males become dark brown to black, with bright blue-green interbars. Interbars are brown and indistinct in females. Lacks humeral spots and preocular and postocular bars as seen in E. zonatum. Grows to 3.3 cm (Rohde et al. 1994). Illustration by Ellen S. Strack-Heiler. Distribution: Lumber and Cape Fear drainages of North Carolina. E. boehlkei is an associate of the evolutionarily distinct Lake Waccamaw fauna, endemic to the lake and surrounding areas (Hubbs and Raney 1946). In northeastern South Carolina a population is found in old ricefield ditches near Georgetown. Several populations occur in tributary ditches of the Waccamaw River near Conway. A genetically distinct, disjunct population occurs in the Santee drainage. Further sampling is necessary to determine distributional limits within the Santee (Quattro et al. 2001). Abundance: Irregular and localized. South Carolina populations seem stable. Populations near Lake Waccamaw (Brunswick and Columbus co., NC) seem to be in decline. At times relatively common in known habitat patches. Populations either use alternate habitats or fluctuate substantially with the seasons. Habitat and ecology: Pygmy sunfishes are generally cryptic, solitary animals. Elassoma boehlkei feeds on microcrustaceans and other small invertebrates.

"Colonialism, Postcolonialism, and Decolonization","In the past two decades, colonial studies, the postcolonial turn, the new imperial history, as well as world and global history have made serious strides toward revising key elements of German history. Instead of insisting that German modernity was a fundamentally unique, insular affair that incubated authoritarian social tendencies, scholars working in these fields have done much to reinsert Germany into the broader logic of nineteenth-century global history, in which the thalassocratic empires of Europe pursued the project of globalizing their economies, populations, and politics. During this period, settler colonies, including German South West Africa, were established and consolidated by European states at the expense of displaced, helotized, or murdered indigenous populations. Complementing these settler colonies were mercantile entrepots and plantation colonies, which sprouted up as part of a systematic, global attempt to reorient non-European economies, work patterns, and epistemological frameworks along European lines. Although more modestly than some of its European collaborators and competitors, Germany joined Britain, France, the Netherlands, and the United States in a largely liberal project of global maritime imperialism.",2018,Central European History

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed data from 102 patients with SRCC or AC confirmed by pathology, including 51 SRCC (from January 2015 to July 2019) and 51 AC patients (from January 2019 to July 2019). CT findings and clinical data, including age, gender, clinical symptoms, serological biomarkers, tumor size, and tumor location, were compared between SRCC and AC. CT texture features were quantified on portal phase images using three-dimensional analysis. A list of texture parameters was generated with MaZda software for the classification of tumors. The texture features, clinical data and CT findings were statistically analyzed for the discrimination ability of SRCC and AC, and the potential predictive parameters that may be used to differentiate the two groups were subsequently tested using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and logistic regression analyses. The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) provided a range of values for establishing the cutoff value, as well as the sensitivity and specificity of prediction for each significant variable. Results: SRCC occurred more often in men than AC did (80.39% vs 49.02%, P < 0.01). The patients were younger in the SRCC group than in the AC group, without a statistically significant difference (55.84 vs 59.20 years, P = 0.216). There were no significant differences in the clinical symptoms, tumor size, or tumor location between the two groups (P=0.505, P=0.19, P=0.843, respectively). The elevation of serological biomarker CA724 was more common in SRCC than in AC (P< 0.001). Perc.01%3D, Perc.10%3D and s(1,0,0) SumAverg were lower in the SRCC group than in the AC group during the portal phase, with the areas under curve (AUCs) of 0.892â€“0.929, sensitivity of 76.5â€“84.3% and specificity of 88.2â€“96.1%. In the differentiation between SRCC and AC, the 1-NN minimal classification error (MCR) was 29.41%. Conclusion: Three-dimensional texture parameters, including Perc.01%3D, Perc.10%3D and s(1,0,0) SumAverg, exhibited a favorable discriminatory ability to distinguish SRCC from AC.",2019,
Proteolytically released Lasso/teneurin-2 induces axonal attraction by interacting with latrophilin-1 on axonal growth cones,"A presynaptic adhesion G-protein-coupled receptor, latrophilin-1, and a postsynaptic transmembrane protein, Lasso/teneurin-2, are implicated in trans-synaptic interaction that contributes to synapse formation. Surprisingly, during neuronal development, a substantial proportion of Lasso is released into the intercellular space by regulated proteolysis, potentially precluding its function in synaptogenesis. We found that released Lasso binds to cell-surface latrophilin-1 on axonal growth cones. Using microfluidic devices to create stable gradients of soluble Lasso, we show that it induces axonal attraction, without increasing neurite outgrowth. Using latrophilin-1 knockout in mice, we demonstrate that latrophilin-1 is required for this effect. After binding latrophilin-1, Lasso causes downstream signaling, which leads to an increase in cytosolic calcium and enhanced exocytosis, processes that are known to mediate growth cone steering. These findings reveal a novel mechanism of axonal pathfinding, whereby latrophilin-1 and Lasso mediate both short-range interaction that supports synaptogenesis, and long-range signaling that induces axonal attraction.",2018,eLife

Pulse Diagnosis Signals Analysis of Fatty Liver Disease and Cirrhosis Patients by Using Machine Learning,"OBJECTIVE
. To compare the signals of pulse diagnosis of fatty liver disease (FLD) patients and cirrhosis patients.


METHODS
After collecting the pulse waves of patients with fatty liver disease, cirrhosis patients, and healthy volunteers, we do pretreatment and parameters extracting based on harmonic fitting, modeling, and identification by unsupervised learning Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and supervised learning Least squares Regression (LS) and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) with cross-validation step by step for analysis.


RESULTS
There is significant difference between the pulse diagnosis signals of healthy volunteers and patients with FLD and cirrhosis, and the result was confirmed by 3 analysis methods. The identification accuracy of the 1st principal component is about 75% without any classification formation by PCA, and supervised learning's accuracy (LS and LASSO) was even more than 93% when 7 parameters were used and was 84% when only 2 parameters were used.


CONCLUSION
The method we built in this study based on the combination of unsupervised learning PCA and supervised learning LS and LASSO might offer some confidence for the realization of computer-aided diagnosis by pulse diagnosis in TCM. In addition, this study might offer some important evidence for the science of pulse diagnosis in TCM clinical diagnosis.",2015,The Scientific World Journal
CoCoA: A General Framework for Communication-Efficient Distributed Optimization,"The scale of modern datasets necessitates the development of efficient distributed optimization methods for machine learning. We present a general-purpose framework for distributed computing environments, CoCoA, that has an efficient communication scheme and is applicable to a wide variety of problems in machine learning and signal processing. We extend the framework to cover general non-strongly-convex regularizers, including L1-regularized problems like lasso, sparse logistic regression, and elastic net regularization, and show how earlier work can be derived as a special case. We provide convergence guarantees for the class of convex regularized loss minimization objectives, leveraging a novel approach in handling non-strongly-convex regularizers and non-smooth loss functions. The resulting framework has markedly improved performance over state-of-the-art methods, as we illustrate with an extensive set of experiments on real distributed datasets.",2017,J. Mach. Learn. Res.
A clinical study of patients with and without recurrence of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation after pulmonary vein isolation.,"Patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) can be treated by pulmonary vein (PV) isolation. However, the recurrence rate after this procedure is relatively high. We sought to evaluate the quality of life (QOL) of patients with PAF recurrence after PV isolation and to analyze factors related to recurrences. Seventy-two drug-refractory PAF patients (59 men, 13 women, mean age 52 +/- 10) were included. PV isolation was based on the disappearance of PV potentials recorded from a Lasso catheter after segmental ostium ablation. Automatic foci were observed in 47 patients (65.3%) during the procedure. A mean of 3.1 +/- 0.9 PVs was isolated. Patients were followed for a mean of 10.3 +/- 5.1 months, during which 27 experienced >1 episode of PAF. QOL was scored from 0 (situation before ablation) to 10 (no episode after ablation) based on a questionnaire completed by 69 patients (95.8%). QOL was judged very good in 26 patients (none with PAF recurrences), better in 30 (15 with PAF recurrences), unchanged in 11 (10 with recurrences), and worse in 2 patients with PAF recurrences. Longer histories of PAF and a lower percentage of patients with automatic foci identified during the procedure were observed in the group with, than in the group without recurrences (P < 0.05). PV isolation improved QOL in patients with PAF, including in patients with recurrences. The length of PAF history and observation of automatic foci may be of importance for recurrences of PAF during long-term follow-up.",2005,Pacing and clinical electrophysiology : PACE
Clinical experience with fat-containing TPN solutions,"The administration of fat to patients receiving TPN is now gaining popularity in the United States but it has been routine in some European countries since a safe fat emulsion became available in the early sixties. Fat has been given to lower the osmolarity of TPN mixtures making possible their administration through peripheral veins1,2 or, in weekly infusions, to prevent essential fatty acid deficiency. Solassol and Joyeux3 from Montpellier introduced the concept of â€˜melange nutritifâ€™ (nutritional mixture) in 1972. They advanced the idea that TPN solutions should be as complete and physiological as possible and suggested that all the basic nutrients could be delivered simultaneously after being mixed in a single container. They showed convincingly that fat emulsions could be incorporated into solutions containing glucose, amino acids, electrolytes and vitamins and that the resultant mixture was stable at 4 Â°C. A silicone U-shaped bag was designed by these authors in which all the nutrients were mixed and then infused through a central venous catheter over 12â€“24 h3â€“5. These bags have now been replaced by plastic disposable containers.",1983,
Application of the Lasso to Expression Quantitative Trait Loci Mapping,"Univariate methods have frequently been used to discover Quantitative Trait Loci for gene expression measurements, often with much success. However, correlations caused by Linkage Disequilibrium as well as chance correlations, which are functions of the large number of markers typically used in such studies, mean that causative regions can often cause multiple signals. Traditional investigations into the number of QTL for a given phenotype, such as visual inspection of likelihood plots, are not feasible when considering thousands of phenotypes. Stepwise methods have been suggested to counter this, but these are known to produce unstable models and there are difficulties in deriving significance estimates. The Lasso is a shrinkage method which has often been employed to discover true signals when the number of variables exceeds the number of observations. We propose a test statistic based on the threshold at which variables enter the Lasso model, prove analytic properties of this statistic which demonstrate parallels with univariate methods and demonstrate its utility in proposing candidate QTL. We show that this method controls for LD structure, and the estimates of statistical significance produced have superior properties when compared to those derived by stepwise methods. We study the performance of our method using simulation studies. These simulations find that the ratio of true discoveries to false positives is often superior for our method compared to univariate and stepwise approaches. Finally, we apply the derived method to data from a previous eQTL mapping experiment to investigate the nature of genetic regulation in this population.",2011,Statistical Applications in Genetics and Molecular Biology
Parameter estimation and variable selection via ArctanLASSO,"Motivated by SICA (smooth integration of counting and absolute deviation) method, this paper proposes a class of concave penalties called ArctanLASSO (Arctangent least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) based on arctangent function. The ArctanLASSO is an alternative smoothing method from $L_0$ to $L_1$ penalty which can be used for simultaneous variable selection and coefficient estimation. The $n^{1/2}$ consistency and oracle property are proved for the ArctanLASSO estimator. An efficient iterate algorithm by LLA (local linear approximation) and coordination descent method is proposed with tuning parameter chosen via the BIC (Bayesian information criterion) criterion. Simulation analysis shows that ArctanLASSO estimator is similar to SICA, and has comparable performance in estimate accuracy and better performance in variable selection than LASSO, SCAD (smoothly clipped absolute deviation), MCP (minimax concave penalty) and adaptive LASSO. The method is meaningful for selecting the significant variables in the empirical analysis.",2016,
"Production, efficiency and managerial selection of workers into peer networks","This dissertation develops empirical models that account for worker interactions, managerial selectivity, and technical inefficiency in the production process. The first chapter, entitled â€œStochastic Frontier Models with Network Selectivity,"" develops a model where workers produce output through peer-effect networks, while managerial selectivity of workers affects worker inefficiency. The intuition behind this model is that managers may consider optimal combinations of workers to produce the best results, and this selectivity in the worker network may affect worker productivity. The second chapter, entitled â€œNetwork Competition and Team Chemistry in the NBA,"" models simultaneous interactions between multiple networks where agents cooperate with peers within their own networks but compete with non-peers from other networks. This paper presents the first econometric model to consider multiple peer networks where workers are engaged in simultaneous competition around a single outcome variable. Lastly, the third chapter, entitled â€œAdaptive LASSO for Stochastic Frontier Models with Many Efficient Firms,"" develops a procedure to select a subset of maximally efficient firms in the sample of interest. In this model, firm inefficiency is measured as a distance from an estimated optimal production level, and I apply the LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, Tibshirani, 1996) to identify a subset of firms whose inefficiencies are estimated as exactly zero. This methodology can be applied to any classification problem where our interest is to identify a subset of best (worst) individuals among a large number of candidates.

Copper chaperones in bacteria: association with copper-transporting ATPases.,"480 0968 â€“ 0004/00/$ â€“ See front matter Â© 2000, Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved. PII: S0968-0004(00)01662-5 The recent TIBS article by Harrison et al.1 discussed the cellular role of copper (Cu) chaperones in eukaryotes and briefly mentioned the presence of a Cu chaperone, CopZ, in Enterococcus hirae and related mercury-binding proteins in other bacteria. The importance of Cu chaperones in delivering Cu to Cudependent enzymes, while protecting the intracellular milieu from Cu toxicity2,3, suggests that they should be universally present in microbial cells. To check whether this is the case, we examined the distribution of CopZ-like heavy-metalassociated (HMA) domains4 among the organisms with completely sequenced genomes. Indeed, a number of microbial genomes were found to encode standalone HMA domains (Cu chaperones) (Fig. 1). Remarkably, in a number of distantly related microorganisms, copZ genes were located adjacent to the genes encoding corresponding metaltransporting ATPases, which contain HMA domains on their N termini, presumably forming operons (Fig. 1). The diversity of the operon organization, as well as the lack of sequence similarity of each particular Cu chaperone to the adjacent HMA domains of Cu-transporting ATPases, suggests that Cu chaperones evolved independently from the Cutransporting ATPases. It is known that operons have relatively short evolutionary half-lives, and few operons are conserved in phylogenetically distant organisms5. Thus, the presence of intact copZâ€“Cu-transporting ATPase operons in such a diverse set of microorganisms suggests strong selective pressure to maintain co-regulation of Cu chaperones and Cu-transporting ATPases, probably to ensure the presence of protective Cu chaperones in the cytoplasm, even before the ATPase can start importing metal ions. It should be noted that we also found some organisms (Synechocystis sp., Neisseria meningitidis, Aeropyrum pernix) in which these genes were unlinked (Fig. 1). In these cases, copZ genes can be easily overlooked in genome annotation (e.g. in Aquifex aeolicus). Certain microorganisms with smaller genomes, such as Borrelia burgdorferi, Chlamydia trachomatis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma genitalium, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Rickettsia prowazekii, do not encode either Cu chaperones or Cutransporting ATPases, which is probably due to their parasitic lifestyle. Finally, some genomes (Escherichia coli, Mycobacterium tuberculosis) appear to encode Cu-transporting ATPases but not Cu chaperones. In the E. coli case, this puzzle has been resolved by the observation6 that these cells still contain substantial amounts of the 6.5 kD Nterminal fragment of the Cu-transporting ATPase YbaR (ATCU_ECOLI), corresponding to its HMA domain. Assuming the genomic sequence is correct, formation of the Cu chaperone in E. coli must be achieved by a specific proteolysis of ATCU_ECOLI. Similar mechanisms of Cu chaperone formation by proteolytic separation of the Nterminal HMA domains can be imagined for other organisms that do not appear to have specific chaperone-encoding genes.
