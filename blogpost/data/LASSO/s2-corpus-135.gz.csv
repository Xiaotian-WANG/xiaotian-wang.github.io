"The latrophilins, ""split-personality"" receptors.","Latrophilin, a neuronal ""adhesion-G protein-coupled receptor"", is the major brain receptor for alpha-latrotoxin, a black widow spidertoxin which stimulates strong neuronal exocytosis in vertebrates. Latrophilin has an unusual structure consisting of two fragments that are produced by the proteolytic cleavage of the parental molecule and that behave independently in the plasma membrane. On binding an agonist, the fragments reassociate and send an intracellular signal. This signal, transduced by a heterotrimeric G protein, causes release of calcium from intracellular stores and massive release of neurotransmitters. Latrophilin represents a phylogenetically conserved family of receptors, with orthologues found in all animals and up to three homologues present in most chordate species. From mammalian homologues, latrophilins 1 and 3 are expressed in neurons, while latrophilin 2 is ubiquitous. Latrophilin 1 may control synapse maturation and exocytosis, whereas latrophilin 2 may be involved in breast cancer. Latrophilins may play different roles during development and in adult animals: thus, LAT-1 determines cell fate in early embryogenesis in Caenorhabditis elegans and controls neurotransmitter release in adult nematodes. This diversity suggests that the functions of latrophilins may be determined by their interactions with respective ligands. The finding of the ligand of latrophilin 1, the large postsynaptic protein lasso, is the first step in the quest for the physiological functions of latrophilins.",2010,Advances in experimental medicine and biology

Book Review: Refractory Depression: Current Strategies and Future Directions,"A clinically relevantand broadreviewof the pharmacology of respiratory diseasesis providedin this text. In the foreword, physicians, nurses, respiratory therapists, and physicaltherapists are identified as those who would benefit from this text, and although not mentioned, pharmacists also could be included in this group. The text is organized into 3 parts: Part I, ScientificBasis for Therapy (Chapters 1-5); Part II, Respiratory Care Drugs (Chapters 6-13); and Part III, Clinical Pharmacology and AppliedResearch(Chapters 14-16). WithinPart I, the authorsincludechapterson basicdrug science,aerosol drug delivery, smooth muscle physiology, mucus production and clearance, and airway immunology.The chapter on basic drug science beginswith a reviewof basicpharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and concludes with the drug approval process. Of historical interest, a table is included with Food and Drug Administrationapproval dates of certain respiratory drugs and a table of the review status for over-thecounterproducts. Thischapteralsoincludes a sectionon literature sources for respiratory pharmacotherapy, includingprimaryliterature sources, review sources, textbooks, pharmacopoeias,and others (e.g., The Merck Index, AHFS Drug Information). The chapter on aerosol drug delivery providesdefinitions of termsused to describeaerosols(e.g., mass median aerodynamic diameter, impaction, sedimentation, diffusion), and technicaland clinical information on variousdeliverydevices (e.g., nebulizers, metered-dose inhalers, accessory devices). A sectionon the nasaldeliveryof aerosols alsois included. Thechapters on smooth muscle, mucus, and immunologyeach begin with a basic reviewof physiology,such as the mechanicsof muscle contractionand differentiationof the immune system,that is well writtenand wouldbe easilyunderstood by thosenew to managing patientswith respiratory disease. . The majorclasses of drugsusedin the treatment of respiratory disorders comprisePart II. Eachchaptercoversa differentclassof drug and begins with a descriptionof the biochemicalmechanismsof action. For example, the chapterson adrenergic and antimuscarinic drugs providefigures of the transmembrane topography and aminoacidsequencefor the betazand muscarinic-receptors, respectively, which are then used to describe receptor stimulation and subsequent activation. Each class of drugs is reviewed for therapeutic and toxic effects. When available, the authors includea briefdescription of drugs that are currentlyin clinicaldevelopment.The finalchapterof thissection is devoted entirelyto emerging and experimental therapies,includinggene therapy,potassium-channel activators,and immunomodulation.

Kriterien zur Behandlung von MRSA im Sputum?,"ZusammenfassungMethicillinresistente StÃ¤mme von Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) sind von besonderer Bedeutung in der Betreuung von Patienten mit Atemwegsinfektionen, da die Erkrankungen oft schwer verlaufen und wegen Multiresistenz schwierig zu behandeln sind. Die Inzidenz ist langsam rÃ¼cklÃ¤ufig, aber immer noch alarmierend hoch. Neben nosokomial erworbenen Infektionen kommen auch ambulant erworbene Infektionen durch hospitalassoziierte, ambulant erworbene und selten auch tierische StÃ¤mme vor. Die nichtnosokomial erworbenen StÃ¤mme weisen andere PathogenitÃ¤tsfaktoren und ein anderes Resistenzspektrum auf und verlaufen oft bedrohlich. MRSA-aktive Antiinfektiva sind ungewohnt und haben besondere ToxizitÃ¤tsmerkmale. Andererseits sind nicht alle Isolate aus Sputum von dramatischer Bedeutung: Eine Kolonisation bei Gesunden wird spontan eliminiert. FÃ¼r die akute Bronchitis stehen wirksame orale Antibiotika zur VerfÃ¼gung. Chronische Atemwegsinfektionen bei schweren strukturellen SchÃ¤den der Atemwege, wie bei Bronchiektasen, benÃ¶tigen allerdings eine komplexe systemische und lokale Therapie zur bakteriellen Elimination.AbstractMethicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are of particular significance for the management of patients with airway infections, since the disease course is often complicated and treatment rendered difficult by multiple resistance. Their prevalence is now slowly declining, but still alarmingly high. Hospital-acquired infections are predominant, but hospital-associated and community-acquired infections do occur, as do rare infections with livestock-acquired strains. Non-nosocomial strains are characterized by different pathogenic factors and aÂ different spectrum of antibacterial resistance; they often have a threatening disease course. Anti-infectives with activity against MRSA are unusual and have particular toxicity profiles. On the other hand, MRSA colonization is eliminated spontaneously in healthy people and acute bronchitis is treatable by common oral antibiotics. However, chronic airway infection in bronchiectasis and other forms of structural airway damage requires aÂ complex systemic and local treatment approach for pathogen elimination.",2017,Der Internist
Hierarchical shrinkage in time-varying parameter models,"In this paper, we forecast EU-area inflation with many predictors using time-varying parameter models. The facts that time-varying parameter models are parameter-rich and the time span of our data is relatively short motivate a desire for shrinkage. In constant coefficient regression models, the Bayesian Lasso is gaining increasing popularity as an effective tool for achieving such shrinkage. In this paper, we develop econometric methods for using the Bayesian Lasso with time-varying parameter models. Our approach allows for the coefficient on each predictor to be: i) time varying, ii) constant over time or iii) shrunk to zero. The econometric methodology decides automatically which category each coefficient belongs in. Our empirical results indicate the benefits of such an approach.",2011,
"Dykstra's Algorithm, ADMM, and Coordinate Descent: Connections, Insights, and Extensions","We study connections between Dykstra's algorithm for projecting onto an intersection of convex sets, the augmented Lagrangian method of multipliers or ADMM, and block coordinate descent. We prove that coordinate descent for a regularized regression problem, in which the (separable) penalty functions are seminorms, is exactly equivalent to Dykstra's algorithm applied to the dual problem. ADMM on the dual problem is also seen to be equivalent, in the special case of two sets, with one being a linear subspace. These connections, aside from being interesting in their own right, suggest new ways of analyzing and extending coordinate descent. For example, from existing convergence theory on Dykstra's algorithm over polyhedra, we discern that coordinate descent for the lasso problem converges at an (asymptotically) linear rate. We also develop two parallel versions of coordinate descent, based on the Dykstra and ADMM connections.",2017,
Research on Financial Early Warning of Listed Companies Based on Lasso-logistic Model,"The financial status is an important factor affecting the survival and development of enterprises. When we conduct financial early-warning model analysis, the selection of index variables and the estimation of model parameters directly affect the prediction accuracy of the early-warning model. Lasso is a variable selection method for shrinkage estimation. By constructing a penalty functions to realize variety selection and retaining the advantages of subset shrinkage; Lasso can be applied to time series, high-dimensional graphics discrimination and selection. In this paper, the Lasso method and the Logistic model are combined to construct an early-warning model reflecting the financial status within the enterprise. The experimental results show that the model can effectively select relatively important influencing factors and also has good predictive evokes.

A Self-Balanced Min-Cut Algorithm for Image Clustering,"Many spectral clustering algorithms have been proposed and successfully applied to image data analysis such as content based image retrieval, image annotation, and image indexing. Conventional spectral clustering algorithms usually involve a two-stage process: eigendecomposition of similarity matrix and clustering assignments from eigenvectors by k-means or spectral rotation. However, the final clustering assignments obtained by the two-stage process may deviate from the assignments by directly optimize the original objective function. Moreover, most of these methods usually have very high computational complexities. In this paper, we propose a new min-cut algorithm for image clustering, which scales linearly to the data size. In the new method, a self-balanced min-cut model is proposed in which the Exclusive Lasso is implicitly introduced as a balance regularizer in order to produce balanced partition. We propose an iterative algorithm to solve the new model, which has a time complexity of O(n) where n is the number of samples. Theoretical analysis reveals that the new method can simultaneously minimize the graph cut and balance the partition across all clusters. A series of experiments were conducted on both synthetic and benchmark data sets and the experimental results show the superior performance of the new method.",2017,2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)
Comprehensive Evaluation of Caregiver-Reported Antiretroviral Therapy Adherence for HIV-Infected Children,"For HIV-infected children, adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is often assessed by caregiver report but there are few data on their validity. We conducted prospective evaluations with 191 children ages 0â€“14Â years and their caregivers over 6Â months in western Kenya to identify questionnaire items that best predicted adherence to ART. Medication Event Monitoring SystemsÂ® (MEMS, MWV/AARDEX Ltd., Switzerland) electronic dose monitors were used as external criterion for adherence. We employed a novel variable selection tool using the LASSO technique with logistic regression to identify items best correlated with dichotomized MEMS adherence (â‰¥90 or <90Â % doses taken). Nine of 48 adherence items were identified as the best predictors of adherence, including missed or late doses in the past 7Â days, problems giving the child medicines, and caregiver-level factors like not being present at medication taking. These items could be included in adherence assessment tools for pediatric patients.",2015,AIDS and Behavior

A pilot study on patient-related costs and factors associated with the cost of specialist palliative care in the hospital: first steps towards a patient classification system in Germany,"BackgroundSpecialist palliative care in the hospital addresses a heterogeneous patient population with complex care needs. In Germany, palliative care patients are classified based on their primary diagnosis to determine reimbursement despite findings that other factors describe patient needs better. To facilitate adequate resource allocation in this setting, in Australia and in the UK important steps have been undertaken towards identifying drivers of palliative care resource use and classifying patients accordingly. We aimed to pioneer patient classification based on determinants of resource use relevant to specialist palliative care in Germany first, by calculating the patient-level cost of specialist palliative care from the hospitalâ€™s perspective, based on the recorded resource use and, subsequently, by analysing influencing factors.MethodsCross-sectional study of consecutive patients who had an episode of specialist palliative care in Munich University Hospital between 20 June and 4 August, 2016. To accurately reflect personnel intensity of specialist palliative care, aside from administrative data, we recorded actual use of all involved health professionalsâ€™ labour time at patient level. Factors influencing episode costs were assessed using generalized linear regression and LASSO variable selection.ResultsThe study included 144 patients. Mean costs of specialist palliative care per palliative care unit episode were 6542â‚¬ (median: 5789â‚¬, SE: 715â‚¬) and 823â‚¬ (median: 702â‚¬, SE: 31â‚¬) per consultation episode. Based on multivariate models that considered both variables recorded at beginning and at the end of episode, we identified factors explaining episode cost including phase of illness, Karnofsky performance score, and type of discharge.ConclusionsThis study is an important step towards patient classification in specialist palliative care in Germany as it provides a feasible patient-level costing method and identifies possible starting points for classification. Application to a larger sample will allow for meaningful classification of palliative patients.",2018,Cost Effectiveness and Resource Allocation : C/E
Large-scale taxi O/D visual analytics for understanding metropolitan human movement patterns,"AbstractIt is very useful to understand metropolitan human movement patterns for better city planning and traffic management. As the most accessible and wide-coverage data source for probing the laws behind
 city pulse and human movement, taxi O/D data have been receiving more and more attention from road traffic administration offices. In this paper, we design a visual analysis system for big taxis O/D data for assisting understanding the spatio-temporal patterns of human mobility. The system first helps users determine the regions of interest for further investigation by the global heat map view of O/D distributions; visually encodes the spatio-temporal patterns of the O/D data of the to-be-analyzed regions chosen by lasso or rectangle region selection tools; and provides a multi-dimensidoneonal analysis of the latent spatio-temporal patterns of taxis O/D data through interactions between multiple coordinated views of visualizations including circular pixel graph, spatio-temporal stacked graph and nested pixel bar. The proposed system of taxis O/D data visual analysis gets interesting findings about the metropolitan residentsâ€™ movement behavior when applied to large-scale real taxis GPS data in Hangzhou and receives good user feedbacks.Graphical abstract",2015,Journal of Visualization
On the efficiency of the de-biased Lasso,"We consider the high-dimensional linear regression model $Y = X \beta^0 + \epsilon$ with Gaussian noise $\epsilon$ and Gaussian random design $X$. We assume that $\Sigma_0:= {{\rm I\hskip-0.48em E}} X^T X / n$ is non-singular and write its inverse as $\Theta^0 := \Sigma_0^{-1}$. The parameter of interest is the first component $\beta_1^0$ of $\beta^0$. We show that the asymptotic variance of a de-biased Lasso estimator can be smaller than $\Theta_{1,1}^0$, under the conditions: $\beta^0$ is sparse in the sense that it has $s_0 = o(\sqrt n / \log p) $ non-zero entries and the first column $\Theta_1^0$ of $\Theta^0$ is not sparse. As by-product, we obtain some results for the Lasso estimator of $\beta^0$ for cases where $\beta^0$ is not sparse.",2017,arXiv: Statistics Theory

An extension of penalized ordinal response models,"An extension of penalized ordinal response models by Qing Zhou A dissertation submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at Virginia Commonwealth University. Virginia Commonwealth University, 2015 Major Director: Kellie J. Archer, Ph.D., Professor, Department of Biostatistics Ordinal responses are commonly seen in medical research. Many pathological evaluations and health status outcomes are reported on an ordinal scales. Some examples of ordinal outcomes include cancer stage (I, II, III and IV), or stage of liver disease (normal liver, chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and end of stage liver disease or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)). In recent years, there has been a demand to understanding the pathogenic association between ordinal clinical outcomes and molecular characteristics. Genomic charactersitics are often assayed using a high-dimensional platform where the number of interrogated sites (P ) exceeds the number of samples (n). Unfortunately, traditional ordinal response models often do not perform well when the number of parameter (P ) exceed the number of observations (n). A good solution to this problem is penalization, for example, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). Here, we extend a LASSO method, the generalized monotone incremental",2016,
"Easy vs. Tricky: The Shape Effect in Tracing, Selecting, and Steering With Mouse, Stylus, and Touch","This short paper is a work-in-progress report on an experimental comparison and evaluation of users' performance in four line-tracing tasks based on two shapes and performed with three input methods (mouse, stylus, and touch-input). The shapes' properties used in the study created the two classes of shapes: easy and hard to replicate. As expected these two classes had different impact on user's performance in each task tested (tracing, lasso selection, steering through narrow and wide tunnel). The results show that participants replicating the shapes using touch-input were the least accurate but were the fastest in comparison to the remaining input methods. The stylus was the least error-prone method and the mouse was the slowest device in drawing tasks (tracing and selection). The differences in error distances between the input methods were less pronounced in steering tasks but timing data showed that mouse was still the slowest one. While the time of replication did not differ between the two shapes tested, the differences between the errors participants made were significant for all tasks and input devices, and patterns of these differences were consistent between the shapes. These results confirm predictions from a previous study and show which shapes' properties can make their replication more difficult. The results can be used to design shapes that are easy to replicate, e.g., in surface-based gestural interaction.",2013,

Contraceptive use is a problem that may contributes to maternal mortality. The rate of unmeet-need according tothe 2012 Demographic Health Survey of Indonesia is 8.5%. The high unmeet-need for family planning services will likely lead to theincidence of unwanted pregnancy. Unwanted pregnancy in post-partum mothers will lead to a very short pregnancy spacing andlikely lead to abortion complications. Yogyakarta City is an area with the least new and active family planning participants in theprovince of Yogyakarta Special Region, with the lowest percentage is in Umbulharjo I Primary Healthcare Centre by 1.63% and72.49%. Meanwhile, antenatal class program in which one of the materials contains postpartum birth control has been implementedin all public health centers in Yogyakarta city, one of which is in Umbulharjo I Primary Healthcare Centre, in accordance with theguidelines for the implementation of the antenatal class. This research aims to identify the effects of participation in antenatal classon the time range of contraceptive use. It belongs to an observational analytical research with cross sectional design to 173respondents taken using purposive sampling and analyzed using Chi-Square Test. Of the 173 respondents, it was found out that themajority of participation in pregnant women class did not meet the standard, numbering 109 mothers (63%) and the time range ofcontraceptive use was not according to the standard (> 42 days), numbering 96 mothers (55.5%).

Functional Graphical Models,"ABSTRACTGraphical models have attracted increasing attention in recent years, especially in settings involving high-dimensional data. In particular, Gaussian graphical models are used to model the conditional dependence structure among multiple Gaussian random variables. As a result of its computational efficiency, the graphical lasso (glasso) has become one of the most popular approaches for fitting high-dimensional graphical models. In this paper, we extend the graphical models concept to model the conditional dependence structure among p random functions. In this setting, not only is p large, but each function is itself a high-dimensional object, posing an additional level of statistical and computational complexity. We develop an extension of the glasso criterion (fglasso), which estimates the functional graphical model by imposing a block sparsity constraint on the precision matrix, via a group lasso penalty. The fglasso criterion can be optimized using an efficient block coordinate descent algorithm...",2019,Journal of the American Statistical Association
Discussion on Safety Analysis Approach for Sodium Fast Reactors,"Utilization of nuclear energy is increasingly necessary not only because of the increasing energy consumption but also because of the controls on greenhouse emissions against global warming. To keep step with such demands, advanced reactors are now world-widely under development with the aims of highly economical advances, and enhanced safety. Recently, further elaborating is encouraged on the research and development program for Generation IV (GEN-IV) reactors, and in collaboration with other interested countries through the Generation IV International Forum (GIF). Sodium-cooled Fast Reactor (SFR) is a strong contender amongst the GEN-IV reactor concepts [1]. Korea also takes part in that program and plans to construct demonstration reactor of SFR [2]. SFR is under the development for a candidate of small modular reactors, for example, PRISM (Power Reactor Innovative Small Module) [3]. Understanding of safety analysis approach has also advanced by the demand of increasing comprehensive safety requirement. Reviewing the past development of the licensing and safety basis in the advanced reactors, such approaches seemed primarily not so satisfactory because the reference framework of licensing and safety analysis approach in the advanced reactors was always the one in water reactors. And, the framework is very plant specific one and thereby the advanced reactors and their frameworks donâ€™t look like a wellassorted couple. Recently as a result of considerable advances in probabilistic safety assessment (PSA), riskinformed approaches are increasingly applied together with some of the deterministic approaches like as the ones in water reactors. Technology neutral framework (TNF) can be said to be the utmost works of such riskinformed approaches, even though an intensive assessment of the applicability has not been sufficiently accomplished [4,5]. This study discusses the viable safety analysis approaches for the urgent application to the construction of pool type SFR. As discussed in above paragraphs the conventional deterministic approach has some defects in directly applying to SFR mainly because of its reactor specific framework and the complete risk-informed approach (TNF) has not been verified sufficiently with much uncertainty. This study presents some insight from critical review of the deterministic approach, risk-informed approach, recent trend in each country, and past SFR licensing approach experiences. The insights are expected to give useful guide for the setup of licensing approach in blending safety analysis approach in stand of deterministic position for the urgent application of the approach.",2012,

Osmotic Adjustment and the Role of Turgor in Mycelial Fungi,"Mycelial fungi crack pavements and destroy homes, burrow through soils and into plants and animals, harpoon rotifers, lasso nematodes, and ejaculate spores. Turgor pressure is responsible, at least in part, for all these phenomena. Like other eukaryotic microorganisms, fungal cells contain a higher concentration of solutes than their surroundings. In consequence, water flows into cells by osmosis during growth. To control cytoplasmic dilution, and the concomitant increase in volume, cells must either remove water with a contractile vacuole or resist swelling with a wall. Therefore, walled cells are pressurized by an influx of water which is driven by osmosis. Because growth must be accompanied by water uptake, mechanisms to control dilution and avoid dehydration are found in all fungi.",1994,
Penalized likelihood for sparse contingency tables with an application to full-length cDNA libraries,"BackgroundThe joint analysis of several categorical variables is a common task in many areas of biology, and is becoming central to systems biology investigations whose goal is to identify potentially complex interaction among variables belonging to a network. Interactions of arbitrary complexity are traditionally modeled in statistics by log-linear models. It is challenging to extend these to the high dimensional and potentially sparse data arising in computational biology. An important example, which provides the motivation for this article, is the analysis of so-called full-length cDNA libraries of alternatively spliced genes, where we investigate relationships among the presence of various exons in transcript species.ResultsWe develop methods to perform model selection and parameter estimation in log-linear models for the analysis of sparse contingency tables, to study the interaction of two or more factors. Maximum Likelihood estimation of log-linear model coefficients might not be appropriate because of the presence of zeros in the table's cells, and new methods are required. We propose a computationally efficient â„“1-penalization approach extending the Lasso algorithm to this context, and compare it to other procedures in a simulation study. We then illustrate these algorithms on contingency tables arising from full-length cDNA libraries.ConclusionWe propose regularization methods that can be used successfully to detect complex interaction patterns among categorical variables in a broad range of biological problems involving categorical variables.",2007,BMC Bioinformatics
Computational Intelligence Modeling of the Macromolecules Release from PLGA Microspheresâ€”Focus on Feature Selection,"Poly-lactide-co-glycolide (PLGA) is a copolymer of lactic and glycolic acid. Drug release from PLGA microspheres depends not only on polymer properties but also on drug type, particle size, morphology of microspheres, release conditions, etc. Selecting a subset of relevant properties for PLGA is a challenging machine learning task as there are over three hundred features to consider. In this work, we formulate the selection of critical attributes for PLGA as a multiobjective optimization problem with the aim of minimizing the error of predicting the dissolution profile while reducing the number of attributes selected. Four bio-inspired optimization algorithms: antlion optimization, binary version of antlion optimization, grey wolf optimization, and social spider optimization are used to select the optimal feature set for predicting the dissolution profile of PLGA. Besides these, LASSO algorithm is also used for comparisons. Selection of crucial variables is performed under the assumption that both predictability and model simplicity are of equal importance to the final result. During the feature selection process, a set of input variables is employed to find minimum generalization error across different predictive models and their settings/architectures. The methodology is evaluated using predictive modeling for which various tools are chosen, such as Cubist, random forests, artificial neural networks (monotonic MLP, deep learning MLP), multivariate adaptive regression splines, classification and regression tree, and hybrid systems of fuzzy logic and evolutionary computations (fugeR). The experimental results are compared with the results reported by SzlÈ©k. We obtain a normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) of 15.97% versus 15.4%, and the number of selected input features is smaller, nine versus eleven.",2016,PLoS ONE

If suchnon-speechauditory display is to beintuitively understandable for non-expert listeners,models thatacousticallyconvey ecologicalattributesareanatural,promising choice(e.g. comparedto abstractacousticsignals). While psychoacousticstudiesof everydaylistening (asopposedto musical listening[1]) form an increasinglybroadbasis,the respective developmentof ecologicallyexpressi ve, flexible andcomputationallyaffordablesoundmodelshasgainedmuchlessattention so far.

Collisions of solid objectsform an importantclassof sonic events in everyday listening. The perception/estimationof ecological informationfrom contactsounds,structural invariants[1], i.e. attributesof involved objectssuchassize,shape,mass,elasticity, surfacepropertiesor material,aswell as transformational invariants, suchas velocities, forcesand position of interaction points, is commonexperience.The soundproducedby a rolling object is generallyparticularlyrich in ecologicalinformation. In additionto characteristicsof involvedobjectsthataregenerallyreflectedin contactsounds,rolling-soundsmaycarryfurtherdetails of form or surfaceaswell astransversalvelocity, gravity or acceleration/deceleration.

Photoacoustic generation by a gold nanosphere: From linear to nonlinear thermoelastics in the long-pulse illumination regime,"We investigate theoretically the photoacoustic generation by a gold nanosphere in water in the thermoelastic regime. Specifically, we consider the long-pulse illumination regime, in which the time for electron-phonon thermalization can be neglected and photoacoustic wave generation arises solely from the thermoelastic stress caused by the temperature increase of the nanosphere or its liquid environment. Photoacoustic signals are predicted based on the successive resolution of a thermal diffusion problem and a thermoelastic problem, taking into account the finite size of the gold nanosphere, thermoelastic and elastic properties of both water and gold, and the temperature dependence of the thermal expansion coefficient of water. For sufficiently high illumination fluences, this temperature dependence yields a nonlinear relationship between the photoacoustic amplitude and the fluence. For nanosecond pulses in the linear regime, we show that more than $90%$ of the emitted photoacoustic energy is generated in water, and the thickness of the generating layer around the particle scales close to the square root of the pulse duration. The amplitude of the photoacoustic wave in the linear regime is accurately predicted by the point-absorber model introduced by Calasso et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 86, 3550 (2001)], but our results demonstrate that this model significantly overestimates the amplitude of photoacoustic waves in the nonlinear regime. We therefore provide quantitative estimates of a critical energy, defined as the absorbed energy required such that the nonlinear contribution is equal to that of the linear contribution. Our results suggest that the critical energy scales as the volume of water over which heat diffuses during the illumination pulse. Moreover, thermal nonlinearity is shown to be expected only for sufficiently high ultrasound frequency. Finally, we show that the relationship between the photoacoustic amplitude and the equilibrium temperature at sufficiently high fluence reflects the thermal diffusion at the nanoscale around the gold nanosphere.",2015,Physical Review B
Extensions of â„“1 regularization increase detection specificity for cell-type specific parameters in dynamic models,"BackgroundOrdinary differential equation systems are frequently utilized to model biological systems and to infer knowledge about underlying properties. For instance, the development of drugs requires the knowledge to which extent malign cells differ from healthy ones to provide a specific treatment with least side effects. As these cell-type specific properties may stem from any part of biochemical cell processes, systematic quantitative approaches are necessary to identify the relevant potential drug targets. An â„“1 regularization for the maximum likelihood parameter estimation proved to be successful, but falsely predicted cell-type dependent behaviour had to be corrected manually by using a Profile Likelihood approach.ResultsThe choice of extended â„“1 penalty functions significantly decreased the number of falsely detected cell-type specific parameters. Thus, the total accuracy of the prediction could be increased. This was tested on a realistic dynamical benchmark model used for the DREAM6 challenge. Among Elastic Net, Adaptive Lasso and a non-convex â„“q penalty, the latter one showed the best predictions whilst also requiring least computation time. All extended methods include a hyper-parameter in the regularization function. For an Erythropoietin (EPO) induced signalling pathway, the extended methods â„“q and Adaptive Lasso revealed an unpublished alternative parsimonious model when varying the respective hyper-parameters.ConclusionsUsing â„“q or Adaptive Lasso with an a-priori choice for the hyper-parameter can lead to a more specific and accurate result than â„“1. Scanning different hyper-parameters can yield additional pieces of information about the system.",2019,BMC Bioinformatics
Comparison of whole-genome prediction models for traits with contrasting genetic architecture in a diversity panel of maize inbred lines,"BackgroundThere is increasing empirical evidence that whole-genome prediction (WGP) is a powerful tool for predicting line and hybrid performance in maize. However, there is a lack of knowledge about the sensitivity of WGP models towards the genetic architecture of the trait. Whereas previous studies exclusively focused on highly polygenic traits, important agronomic traits such as disease resistances, nutrifunctional or climate adaptational traits have a genetic architecture which is either much less complex or unknown. For such cases, information about model robustness and guidelines for model selection are lacking. Here, we compared five WGP models with different assumptions about the distribution of the underlying genetic effects. As contrasting model traits, we chose three highly polygenic agronomic traits and three metabolites each with a major QTL explaining 22 to 30% of the genetic variance in a panel of 289 diverse maize inbred lines genotyped with 56,110 SNPs.ResultsWe found the five WGP models to be remarkable robust towards trait architecture with the largest differences in prediction accuracies ranging between 0.05 and 0.14 for the same trait, most likely as the result of the high level of linkage disequilibrium prevailing in elite maize germplasm. Whereas RR-BLUP performed best for the agronomic traits, it was inferior to LASSO or elastic net for the three metabolites. We found the approach of genome partitioning of genetic variance, first applied in human genetics, as useful in guiding the breeder which model to choose, if prior knowledge of the trait architecture is lacking.ConclusionsOur results suggest that in diverse germplasm of elite maize inbred lines with a high level of LD, WGP models differ only slightly in their accuracies, irrespective of the number and effects of QTL found in previous linkage or association mapping studies. However, small gains in prediction accuracies can be achieved if the WGP model is selected according to the genetic architecture of the trait. If the trait architecture is unknown e.g. for novel traits which only recently received attention in breeding, we suggest to inspect the distribution of the genetic variance explained by each chromosome for guiding model selection in WGP.",2012,BMC Genomics
Effects of an excursion on mental health,"The increase of mental health disease, including depression, is a current social problem, and measures must be identified to prevent or reduce it in the future. This study examined the effect of mental health tours on the stress levels of persons with high-risk mental health. The stress levels of 65 men and women were investigated through a questionnaires and saliva samples both before and after they participated in a tour. Results .showed that, regardless of the tourâ€™s content, participants who went on a trip improved their mental health when compared with participants who did not go. Moreover, it was shown that thalassotherapy was effective at reducing the stress levels of persons with high levels of depression. Based on these findings, this study proposes mental health tourism as a measure to prevent mental health problems.",2011,
"Darstellung, ReaktivitÃ¤t und Struktur von Mono- und Di-Manganiophosphonium Salzen sowie Lewis-SÃ¤ure-Base-Addukte von Ferraten mit metallorganischen LewissÃ¤uren","Die Isolobal-Analogie ist ein nutzliches Konzept zur Systematisierung metallierter
Phosphor-Verbindungen, aber auch zur Synthesestrategie bzw. Abschatzung von
Reaktivitatspotentialen isolobaler Fragmente. Im ersten Teil der Arbeit werden
neue Beispiele von mono- bzw. dimetallierten Phosphonium-Salzen, namlich
Mono- und Dimanganiophosphonium-Salze mit dem 17-VE-Komplexfragment
Cpâ€™Mn(CO)(NO) vorgestellt.
Aus 1a,b lassen sich mit Ph2PH die Monomanganiophosphonium-Salze
[{Cp'Mn(CO)(NO)}PPh2H] +X- (X = BF4
-, PF6
-) (2a,b) darstellen. Diese werden mit
Hilfe von DABCO zum Monomanganiophosphan 3 deprotoniert, das allerdings so
instabil ist, das es nicht in reiner Form isoliert werden kann. Seine Existenz last
sich aber durch chemische Reaktionen indirekt nachweisen. So wird 3 mit MeI
bzw. MeSO3CF3 am Phosphor zum methylierten Monomanganiophosphonium-
Salz 4 umgesetzt. Das methylierte Manganiophosphoniumsalz 4 konnte auf
zweierlei Weise erhalten werden: es entsteht sowohl mit Methyliodid als auch mit
Trifluorsulfonsauremethylester als Methylierungsmittel aus 3. Die direkte
Methylierung mit MeI ist dabei vorzuziehen, da keine Base eingesetzt werden
mus. Aus 3 last sich durch Metallierung mit CpFe(CO)2Cl auch ein bisher
unbekanntes heterodimetalliertes Ferriomanganiophosphonium-Salz in Form von
8 synthetisieren. Die fur die Darstellung von Diferriophosphonium-Salzen gangige
Silylmethode aus FpCl und Ph2PSiMe3 last sich nicht auf Mangan ubertragen, weil
ein geeignetes Mangan-Edukt mit einem Halogeno-Liganden fehlt. Stattdessen
mus man von dem metallorganischen Salz [{Cp'Mn(CO)(NO)}PPh2H]BF4 mit demausgesprochen harten Anion BF4
- als Edukt ausgehen, dieses deprotonieren und
mit dem Epoxid C6H10O zu 7 umsetzen.
Dies hat zur Folge, das Dimanganiophosphonium-Salze praparativ aufwendiger
dargestellt werden mussen, da letztlich zwei Syntheseschritte notwendig sind.
Eine grose Schwierigkeit ist dabei die Produktisolierung, da die zunachst
eingesetzte Base DBU nur auserst schlecht abgetrennt werden kann. Bei
Verwendung der festen Base DABCO konnte diese durch mehrmaliges Waschen
mit n-Hexan/CH2Cl2 vollstandig entfernt werden und 7 sauber erhalten werden.
Eine Ubersicht der bisher behandelten Reaktionen mit dem Metallorest
CpMn(CO)NO ist in Schema 1 wiedergegeben.Im zweiten Teil der Arbeit wird die Lewis-Basen-Aktivitat von stark reduzierten
Carbonyl-Ferraten untersucht. Es wurde hauptsachlich das phosphansubstituierte
Eisen-Salz K2[Fe(CO)3PPh3] eingesetzt und mit verschiedenen metallorganischen
Lewissauren umgesetzt. Neben den erwarteten Produkten wurden auch einige
uberraschende Ergebnisse erzielt (Schema 2). Der Î·2-Digold-Komplex 9 entsteht
durch Umsetzung von K2[Fe(CO)3PPh3] mit zwei Aquivalenten Ph3PAuCl wobei
wegen der bei Gold(I) ausgepragten d10-d10-Wechselwirkung - von Schmidbaur
auch Aurophilie genannt - eine Au-Au-Bindung entsteht, die mit dem nucleophilen
Eisenatom eine Dreiringstruktur ausbildet.
Die Bildung von 9 stellt eine metallassoziierte Kopplungsreaktion fur Au(I)-Ionen
dar. Eine analoge Kopplungsreaktion wird beobachtet, wenn K2[Fe(CO)3PPh3] mit
Ph2SbCl zum Distiban-Komplex 13 umgesetzt wird. Das dabei im Sinne einer
""Wurtz-Reaktion"" gebildete Tetraphenyldistiban koordiniert einfach einzahnig an
das metallorganische Komplexfragment in trans-Position zum Phosphanliganden;
bisher waren in der Literatur nur zweifach verbruckende Distiban-Liganden
bekannt.
Eine Umsetzung mit dem gruppenhomologen Diphenylchlorarsan scheiterte, da es
nach o.g. Literaturvorschriften nicht genugend rein dargestellt werden konnte. Als
Hauptprodukt fiel stets Ph2AsBr an. Dessen analoge Umsetzung fuhrte nicht zum
erwarteten Ergebnis, da sich der Eisenkomplex zersetzte. Dagegen fuhrte die

Adjunctive interpulmonary isthmus ablation has no added effects on atrial fibrillation recurrence,"OBJECTIVE
Data on the efficacy of adjunctive interpulmonary isthmus ablation following completion of extensive encircling pulmonary vein isolation (EEPVI) on atrial fibrillation (AF) recurrence have still been insufficient. We aimed to compare the AF recurrence between EEPVI with and without adjunctive interpulmonary isthmus ablation.


METHODS
We enrolled 200 consecutive patients with paroxysmal AF (first session) who underwent EEPVI with double-Lasso technique. Patients were prospectively randomised into two groups: EEPVI with (group 1) and without (group 2) adjunctive interpulmonary isthmus ablation.


RESULTS
No differences were found in patients' clinical and echocardiographic backgrounds, including arrhythmia status, between the two groups. No differences were also observed in complications (two groin haematoma in both groups). All patients in both groups reached the EEPVI endpoint. The AF recurrence rate between groups 1 (32/100, 32%) and 2 (33/100, 33%; p=1.0) was quite similar during the follow-up period (45Â±5 months; 36-54 months). The two groups showed identical Kaplan-Meier AF-free curves (p=0.460; NS). Similar pulmonary vein (PV) reconnection incidence was observed in both groups during the second session. Durable isolation between the superior and inferior PVs was confirmed in 88% (21/27) of patients in group 1, indicating that interpulmonary isthmus ablation maintained a non-conducting state in a considerable number of patients. Nevertheless, AF recurrence was identical between the two groups.


CONCLUSION
The results of our study showed similar AF recurrence rates between the two groups, indicating that adjunctive interpulmonary isthmus ablation with EEPVI has no obvious effects on AF recurrence.",2017,Open Heart
Predicting clinically promising therapeutic hypotheses using tensor factorization,"BackgroundDetermining which target to pursue is a challenging and error-prone first step in developing a therapeutic treatment for a disease, where missteps are potentially very costly given the long-time frames and high expenses of drug development. With current informatics technology and machine learning algorithms, it is now possible to computationally discover therapeutic hypotheses by predicting clinically promising drug targets based on the evidence associating drug targets with disease indications. We have collected this evidence from Open Targets and additional databases that covers 17 sources of evidence for target-indication association and represented the data as a tensor of 21,437â€‰Ã—â€‰2211â€‰Ã—â€‰17.ResultsAs a proof-of-concept, we identified examples of successes and failures of target-indication pairs in clinical trials across 875 targets and 574 disease indications to build a gold-standard data set of 6140 known clinical outcomes. We designed and executed three benchmarking strategies to examine the performance of multiple machine learning models: Logistic Regression, LASSO, Random Forest, Tensor Factorization and Gradient Boosting Machine. With 10-fold cross-validation, tensor factorization achieved AUROCâ€‰=â€‰0.82â€‰Â±â€‰0.02 and AUPRCâ€‰=â€‰0.71â€‰Â±â€‰0.03. Across multiple validation schemes, this was comparable or better than other methods.ConclusionIn this work, we benchmarked a machine learning technique called tensor factorization for the problem of predicting clinical outcomes of therapeutic hypotheses. Results have shown that this method can achieve equal or better prediction performance compared with a variety of baseline models. We demonstrate one application of the method to predict outcomes of trials on novel indications of approved drug targets. This work can be expanded to targets and indications that have never been clinically tested and proposing novel target-indication hypotheses. Our proposed biologically-motivated cross-validation schemes provide insight into the robustness of the prediction performance. This has significant implications for all future methods that try to address this seminal problem in drug discovery.",2019,BMC Bioinformatics
Model-based sensorless robot collision detection under model uncertainties with a fast dynamics identification,"This article presents a novel model-based sensorless collision detection scheme for humanâ€“robot interaction. In order to recognize external impacts exerted on the manipulator with sensitivity and robustness without additional exteroceptive sensors, the method based on torque residual, which is the difference between nominal and actual torque, is adopted using only motor-side information. In contrast to classic dynamics identification procedure which requires complicated symbolic derivation, a sequential dynamics identification was proposed by decomposing robot dynamics into gravity and friction item, which is simple in symbolic expression and easy to identify with least squares method, and the remaining structure-complex torque effect. Subsequently, the remaining torque effect was reformulated to overcome the structural complexity of original expression and experimentally recovered using a machine learning approach named Lasso while keeping the involving candidates number reduced to a certain degree. Moreover, a state-dependent dynamic threshold was developed to handle the abnormal peaks in residual due to model uncertainties. The effectiveness of the proposed method was experimentally validated on a conventional industrial manipulator, which illustrates the feasibility and simplicity of the collision detection method.",2019,International Journal of Advanced Robotic Systems
"Prospective prediction of suicide attempts in community adolescents and young adults, using regression methods and machine learning.","BACKGROUND
The use of machine learning (ML) algorithms to study suicidality has recently been recommended. Our aim was to explore whether ML approaches have the potential to improve the prediction of suicide attempt (SA) risk. Using the epidemiological multiwave prospective-longitudinal Early Developmental Stages of Psychopathology (EDSP) data set, we compared four algorithms-logistic regression, lasso, ridge, and random forest-in predicting a future SA in a community sample of adolescents and young adults.


METHODS
The EDSP Study prospectively assessed, over the course of 10 years, adolescents and young adults aged 14-24 years at baseline. Of 3021 subjects, 2797 were eligible for prospective analyses because they participated in at least one of the three follow-up assessments. Sixteen baseline predictors, all selected a priori from the literature, were used to predict follow-up SAs. Model performance was assessed using repeated nested 10-fold cross-validation. As the main measure of predictive performance we used the area under the curve (AUC).


RESULTS
The mean AUCs of the four predictive models, logistic regression, lasso, ridge, and random forest, were 0.828, 0.826, 0.829, and 0.824, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
Based on our comparison, each algorithm performed equally well in distinguishing between a future SA case and a non-SA case in community adolescents and young adults. When choosing an algorithm, different considerations, however, such as ease of implementation, might in some instances lead to one algorithm being prioritized over another. Further research and replication studies are required in this regard.",2019,Journal of affective disorders
Aneurisma del setto interatriale di origine familiare: quali implicazioni?,"Lâ€™aneurisma del setto interatriale (ASA) e unâ€™anomalia cardiaca caratterizzata da assottigliamento e incurvamento del pavimento della fossa ovale che protrude nelle camere cardiache. Tale formazione puo essere fissa o fluttuare tra i due atri. Hanley et al.1 definiscono aneurismatico il setto interatriale quando la base della porzione protrudente e â‰¥15 mm e la protrusione dellâ€™aneurisma o di parte di esso e â‰¥15 mm oltre il piano del setto oppure le escursioni fasiche dellâ€™area aneurismatica durante il ciclo cardiaco sono di ampiezza â‰¥15 mm. Questa anomalia puo essere isolata ma spesso si associa ad altre anomalie strutturali, come per esempio il formale ovale pervio (FOP), i difetti interatriali tipo ostium secundum e il prolasso della valvola mitrale1-5. Molti studi hanno evidenziato una correlazione tra ASA e/o FOP e ictus criptogenetici6-15. Tuttavia, lâ€™assenza di criteri diagnostici omogenei ha portato a risultati diversi e contraddittori. Pertanto, anche se il FOP e lâ€™ASA sono attualmente riconosciuti come anomalie associate a embolia cardiogena, non e ancora certo un rapporto causa-effetto. Infatti, se da un lato il FOP puo essere responsabile di unâ€™embolia paradossa a partenza venosa, dallâ€™altro sia lâ€™ASA che il FOP stesso possono favorire la formazione di emboli in situ oppure innescare episodi ricorrenti di aritmie sopraventricolari16-18, come per esempio la fibrillazione atriale (FA). In ogni caso, soltanto la concomitante presenza di entrambe le anomalie sembra rappresentare una condizione favorente lâ€™ictus11,19,20, in particolare se e presente uno shunt a riposo, se lâ€™entita dello shunt a livello cerebrale e marcata (>10 bolle allâ€™eco-Doppler transcranico), se nellâ€™anamnesi vi sono eventi cerebrovascolari multipli, se lâ€™eta del paziente e >65 anni e se, verosimilmente, coesistono anomalie della coagulazione in senso trombofilico21. Recentemente Paraskevaidis et al.22 hanno segnalato una ricorrenza familiare dellâ€™ASA che sembra limitata al sesso femminile.

"Determination of environmental water requirements of Lake Urmia, Iran: an ecological approach","Lake Urmia is a thalassohaline ecosystem. It is an extremely simple ecological pyramid. This makes it a very sensitive ecosystem. This ecosystem has been facing various threats regarding the amount of water released from the associated basin. To calculate the lake water requirement with an ecological approach, we identified three variables: ecology, water quality, and water quantity indices as environmental indicators. The ecological index represented by Artemia urmiana is considered as an independent variable; while, the water quality index represented by concentration of NaCl, and the water quantity index represented by water elevation are regarded as dependent variables. The salinity threshold of 240 ppt (parts per thousand) is selected as the water quality requirement for Artemia urmiana. Finally, the aggregation of these variables shows that Lake Urmia requires annually 3086 MCM of inflow water to have a sustainable ecosystem.",2007,International Journal of Environmental Studies
Serum miRNA-based Prediction of Axillary Lymph Node Metastasis in Breast Cancer.,"PURPOSE
Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is the gold-standard procedure for evaluating axillary lymph node (ALN) status in patients with breast cancer. However, the morbidity of SLNB is not negligible, and the procedure is invasive for patients without ALN metastasis. Here, we developed a diagnostic model for evaluating ALN status using a combination of serum miRNAs and clinicopathologic factors as a novel less-invasive biomarker.Experimental Design: Preoperative serum samples were collected from patients who underwent surgery for primary breast cancer or breast benign diseases between 2008 and 2014. A total of 958 serum samples (921 cases of primary breast cancer, including 630 cases in the no ALN metastasis group and 291 cases in the ALN metastasis group, and 37 patients with benign breast diseases) were analyzed by miRNA microarray. Samples were randomly divided into training and test sets. Logistic LASSO regression analysis was used to construct diagnostic models in the training set, which were validated in the test set.


RESULTS
An optimal diagnostic model was identified using a combination of two miRNAs (miR-629-3p and miR-4710) and three clinicopathologic factors (T stage, lymphovascular invasion, and ultrasound findings), which showed a sensitivity of 0.88 (0.84-0.92), a specificity of 0.69 (0.61-0.76), an accuracy of 0.818, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.86 in the test set.


CONCLUSIONS
Serum miRNA profiles may be useful for the diagnosis of ALN metastasis before surgery in a less-invasive manner than SLNB.",2019,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research

An Additive Sparse Penalty for Variable Selection in High-Dimensional Linear Regression Model,"We consider a sparse high-dimensional linear regression model. Penalized methods using LASSO or nonconvex penalties have been widely used for variable selection and estimation in high-dimensional regression models. In penalized regression, the selection and prediction performances depend on which penalty function is used. For example, it is known that LASSO has a good prediction performance but tends to select more variables than necessary. In this paper, we propose an additive sparse penalty for variable selection using a combination of LASSO and minimax concave penalties (MCP). The proposed penalty is designed for good properties of both LASSO and MCP. We develop an efficient algorithm to compute the proposed estimator by combining a concave convex procedure and coordinate descent algorithm. Numerical studies show that the proposed method has better selection and prediction performances compared to other penalized methods.",2015,Communications for Statistical Applications and Methods
Variable Screening for High Dimensional Time Series,"Variable selection is a widely studied problem in high dimensional statistics, primarily since estimating the precise relationship between the covariates and the response is of great importance in many scientific disciplines. However, most of theory and methods developed towards this goal for the linear model invoke the assumption of iid sub-Gaussian covariates and errors. This paper analyzes the theoretical properties of Sure Independence Screening (SIS) (Fan and Lv [J. R. Stat. Soc. Ser. B Stat. Methodol. 70 (2008) 849-911]) for high dimensional linear models with dependent and/or heavy tailed covariates and errors. We also introduce a generalized least squares screening (GLSS) procedure which utilizes the serial correlation present in the data. By utilizing this serial correlation when estimating our marginal effects, GLSS is shown to outperform SIS in many cases. For both procedures we prove sure screening properties, which depend on the moment conditions, and the strength of dependence in the error and covariate processes, amongst other factors. Additionally, combining these screening procedures with the adaptive Lasso is analyzed. Dependence is quantified by functional dependence measures (Wu [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 102 (2005) 14150-14154]), and the results rely on the use of Nagaev type and exponential inequalities for dependent random variables. We also conduct simulations to demonstrate the finite sample performance of these procedures, and include a real data application of forecasting the US inflation rate.",2017,arXiv: Methodology
Grouped and Hierarchical Model Selection through Composite Absolute Penalties,"Extracting useful information from high-dimensional data is an important part of the focus of todayâ€™s statistical research and practice. Penalized loss function minimization has been shown to be eective for this task both theoretically and empirically. With the virtues of both regularization and sparsity, the L1-penalized L2 minimization method Lasso has been popular in regression models. In this paper, we combine dierent norms including L1 to form an intelligent penalty in order to add side information to the fitting of a regression or classification model to obtain reasonable estimates. Specifically, we introduce the Composite Absolute Penalties (CAP) family which allows the grouping and hierarchical relationships between the predictors to be expressed. CAP penalties are built by defining groups and combining the properties of norm penalties at the across group and within group levels. Grouped selection occurs for non-overlapping groups. In that case, we give a Bayesian",2007,
Low host specificity in the Kudoidae (Myxosporea: Multivalvulida) including seventeen new host records for Kudoa thalassomi.,"Kudoid parasites are known to infect a large variety of fish. A significant proportion of Kudoa species have relatively low host specificity, with a single species able to infect multiple host species representing various host families even from different host orders. Since DNA sequences have been associated with myxosporean species characterisations, it has become far easier to determine host range of new species and validate host records from earlier descriptions. This study investigated the host specificity of a kudoid parasite, Kudoa thalassomi Adlard, Bryant, Whipps et Kent, 2005, from the Great Barrier Reef in Australia using DNA sequence analysis and morphology. The results revealed the host specificity to be broad, with K. thalassomi identified in 18 different fish species representing six different fish families. This study also compares current genetic information from different host isolates of Kudoa Meglitsch, 1947 to their host ranges recorded in existing literature. From this analysis, only half of the Kudoa species with multiple host records (27 Kudoa species) have half or more isolates that are genetically characterised, and thus specifically identified with a high confidence, from their known hosts. Only five kudoid species have genetically characterised isolates from all of their recorded hosts.",2011,Folia parasitologica
Model selection via the lasso in conditional logistic regression,"We propose a model selection procedure in the context of matched case-control studies and, more specifically, for the conditional logistic regression. The method is based on penalized conditional likelihood with an L1-type penalty of the regression coefficients, the so-called lasso. This penalty, which shrinks coefficients to improve the accuracy of prediction, is particularly adapted when the number of covariates is large (with respect to the number of events) or in case of collinearity between them. An attractive property of the lasso is that it performs parameter estimation and variable selection simultaneously. The implementation of the method is based on a simple modification of the R-package ""penalized"" for fitting generalized linear and Cox proportional hazard models with L1 or L2 penalties, developed by J. Goeman. The effectiveness of the algorithms allows the use of resampling methods for choosing the regularization term and for evaluating the stability of the selected model. Thus, K-fold likelihood cross-validation and bootstrap are applied, both taking into account the dependent nature of data. The methodology is illustrated with some examples.",2009,
PrÃ©diction de la progression chez des patients atteints de myÃ©lome multiple avec des Random Survival Forest,"Introduction Le myelome multiple (MM) est un cancer de la moelle osseuse caracterise par une survie a 5Â ans de 54Â %. Tres peu dâ€™etudes sâ€™interessent a la prediction de la survie des patients atteints de MM et encore moins a partir de biomarqueurs par imagerie. Les methodes de Cox et de Kaplanâ€“Meier sont les plus utilisees dans le contexte de la survie. Cependant, les Random Survival Forest (RSF), une methode dâ€™ensemble dâ€™arbres, peut fournir un procede plus robuste pour lâ€™analyse de la survie et nâ€™est pour le moment pas etudie dans le cadre du MM et de lâ€™imagerie TEP. Nous proposons une methode pour la prediction de la progression dans le contexte du MM en utilisant des RSF avec la methode de selection par Â«Â variable importanceÂ Â» (VIMP) (Ishwaran et al., Annals of Applied Statistics, 2008). Methodes Cette etude est basee sur un essai clinique francais multicentrique et prospectif, IMAJEM, visant lâ€™evaluation du benefice potentiel de lâ€™imagerie TEP/TDM dans le diagnostic du MM (Moreau et al.

Scoring function to predict solubility mutagenesis,"BackgroundMutagenesis is commonly used to engineer proteins with desirable properties not present in the wild type (WT) protein, such as increased or decreased stability, reactivity, or solubility. Experimentalists often have to choose a small subset of mutations from a large number of candidates to obtain the desired change, and computational techniques are invaluable to make the choices. While several such methods have been proposed to predict stability and reactivity mutagenesis, solubility has not received much attention.ResultsWe use concepts from computational geometry to define a three body scoring function that predicts the change in protein solubility due to mutations. The scoring function captures both sequence and structure information. By exploring the literature, we have assembled a substantial database of 137 single- and multiple-point solubility mutations. Our database is the largest such collection with structural information known so far. We optimize the scoring function using linear programming (LP) methods to derive its weights based on training. Starting with default values of 1, we find weights in the range [0,2] so that predictions of increase or decrease in solubility are optimized. We compare the LP method to the standard machine learning techniques of support vector machines (SVM) and the Lasso. Using statistics for leave-one-out (LOO), 10-fold, and 3-fold cross validations (CV) for training and prediction, we demonstrate that the LP method performs the best overall. For the LOOCV, the LP method has an overall accuracy of 81%.AvailabilityExecutables of programs, tables of weights, and datasets of mutants are available from the following web page: http://www.wsu.edu/~kbala/OptSolMut.html.",2010,Algorithms for Molecular Biology : AMB
Tight Performance Bounds for Compressed Sensing With Conventional and Group Sparsity,"In this paper, we study the problem of recovering a group sparse vector from a small number of linear measurements. In the past, the common approach has been to use various â€œgroup sparsity-inducingâ€ norms such as the Group LASSO norm for this purpose. By using the theory of convex relaxations, we show that it is also possible to use <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\ell _1$</tex-math></inline-formula>-norm minimization for group sparse recovery. We introduce a new concept called group robust null space property (GRNSP), and show that, under suitable conditions, a group version of the restricted isometry property (GRIP) implies the GRNSP, and thus leads to group sparse recovery. When all groups are of equal size, our bounds are sometimes less conservative than known bounds. Moreover, our results apply even to situations where the groups have different sizes. When specialized to conventional sparsity, our bounds reduce to one of the well-known â€œbest possibleâ€ conditions for sparse recovery. This relationship between GRNSP and GRIP is new even for conventional sparsity, and substantially streamlines the proofs of some known results. Using this relationship, we derive bounds on the <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\ell _p$</tex-math></inline-formula>-norm of the residual error vector for all <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$p \in [1,2]$</tex-math></inline-formula>, and not just when <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$p = 2$</tex-math></inline-formula>. When the measurement matrix consists of random samples of a sub-Gaussian random variable, we present bounds on the number of measurements, which are sometimes less conservative than currently known bounds.",2019,IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing

Heatshock Protein (HSP) Family Expression Is Dichotomous and Prognostic in Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML),"Background. Heat shock family proteins (HSP) are induced by cellular stress, and act as molecular chaperones regulating protein folding, conformation and proteosomal degradation, thereby affecting cell stability, cycling, and apoptosis. High levels of some HSP have been observed in AML and high HSP90 is prognostically adverse. Cell line studies show that HSP protects AML cells against chemotherapy or other stresses and that inhibition of HSP 27, 70 or 90 has antileukemic activity. HSP proteins have typically been studied individually, and in small series. Interactions with multiple signaling and functional pathways are suspected, but the actual relationship in primary AML samples is unknown. We therefore investigated the protein expression of members of the HSPA, B and C groups, HSP 70, 27 and 90, Hugo Names HSPA1A_L, HSPB1 and HSP90AA1_B1, respectively, in a large series of 511 AML patients and compared expression to 228 other simultaneously measured proteins. Methods. We made a reverse phase protein array (RPPA) with protein from leukemia enriched cells from 511 new AML patients. Both bone marrow (BM, n=387) and peripheral blood (PB, n=283) samples were used, with 140 cases having both. The RPPA was probed with 231 strictly validated antibodies, including antibodies against HSP27, 70 and 90. Expression was compared to that of normal bone marrow derived CD34+ cells. Interaction networks with the other 228 proteins were generated from the RPPA data using glasso and supplemented by the literature of known interactions. Results: A heatmap of HSP27, 70 and 90 expression was generated and hierarchical k-and means clustering performed (Fig 1A). Using the â€œPrototype Clusteringâ€ method an optimal division into two clusters C1) characterized by High HSP27 and 70 but low HSP90 and C2) characterized by High HSP90 and low HSP27 and 70 expression. Patients with high HSP90 had significantly higher % BM Blasts (63.6% vs. 42%), WBC (40.8K vs 16.9K), %PB blasts (44 vs. 17%), LDH levels, concurrent infection 34% vs. 12%), FLT3-ITD (25 vs. 13%) or FLT3-D835 mutation (8% vs. 4%) (all P Conclusions. AML is characterized by dichotomous expression of HSP proteins 27, 70 and 90. HSP expression pattern is associated with FLT3 mutation but not cytogenetics. HSP90 expression is prognostically adverse, exclusively among those with intermediate cytogenetics. High HSP90 expression is associated with higher WBC and PB and BM blast percentages, suggesting a proliferative advantage. This may arise through the effects of Myc and through increased gene expression arising from increased histone3K4 trimethylation from ASH2L and decreased histone 3 acetylation due to increased Sirt1 levels. Therapeutics directed at interfering with HSP function will need to consider which HSP pattern a patient exhibits to target the correct family members.

9 Cellular Receptors for Alphaviruses,"Receptors on host cells that are used by viruses to enter cells and initiate infection have received a great deal of attention of late because of their obvious importance in determining in large part the host range, tissue tropism, and virulence of a virus. The alphaviruses represent an interesting and special situation. The members of this group have an enormous host range that comprises both invertebrate hosts and vertebrate hosts (Chamberlain 1980; Griffin 1986; Niklasson 1988; Peters and Dalrymple 1990). All alphaviruses are transmitted by arthropod vectors, in which the virus replicates. Mosquitoes are used as vectors by most alphaviruses, but Fort Morgan and Bijou Bridge viruses are vectored by swallow bugs, and several alphaviruses, including Sindbis virus (SIN) (Shah et al. 1960) and eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEE) (Scott and Weaver 1989), have been isolated from mites and other hematophagous arthropods as well as from mosquitoes. In the case of EEE, the major vector is the mosquito Culiseta melanura , but other mosquitoes can also transmit the virus and naturally infected chicken mites have been shown to be able to transmit the virus, albeit inefficiently. During the process of mosquito transmission, the virus must productively infect several tissues within the mosquito. The virus is ingested when the insect feeds on a viremic host and first infects cells of the midgut; later the infection must spread to the salivary glands in order for the mosquito to transmit the virus when it next feeds on a vertebrate. A wide variety of vertebrates,...",1994,Cold Spring Harbor Monograph Archive
An unbiased decoding of ventral striatal oscillations in a rat model of binge eating: Finding the balance between model complexity and performance,"The ventral striatum (VS) is a central node within a distributed network that controls appetitive behavior, and neuromodulation of the VS has demonstrated therapeutic potential for appetitive disorders. Local field potential (LFP) oscillations recorded from deep brain stimulation electrodes within the VS are a pragmatic source of neural systems-level information about appetitive behavior that could be used in responsive neuromodulation systems. Here, we recorded LFPs from the bilateral nucleus accumbens core and shell (subregions of the VS) during limited access to palatable food across varying conditions of hunger and food palatability in male rats. We used standard statistical methods (logistic regression) as well as the machine learning algorithm lasso to predict aspects of feeding behavior using VS LFPs. These models were able to predict the amount of food eaten, the increase in consumption following food deprivation, and the type of food eaten. Further, we were able to predict whether the initiation of feeding was imminent up to 42.5 seconds before feeding began and classify current behavior as either feeding or not-feeding. In classifying this behavior, we found an optimal balance between model complexity and performance with models using 3 LFP features primarily from the alpha and high gamma frequencies. As shown here, unbiased methods can identify systems-level neural activity linked to symptoms of mental illness with potential application to the development and personalization of novel treatments.",2018,bioRxiv
[Contrast-enhanced CT and texture analysis of mass-forming pancreatitis and cancer in the pancreatic head].,"Objective: To explore the value of contrast-enhanced CT combined with texture analysis in differentiating pancreatic cancer from mass-forming pancreatitis in pancreatic head. Methods: A retrospective study collected 21 patients with pancreatic head mass-forming pancreatitis confirmed by surgery or biopsy and 47 patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma confirmed by surgery. The patients visited the Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine and the First Affiliated Hospital of Wannan Medical College between January 2014 and December 2017. Gender, age and CT findings were collected. The parenchymal phase was selected for texture analysis. The minimum absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method was applied for dimensionality reduction.Two independent sample t-tests or Mann-Whitney U test were used for continuous variables based on the Shapiro-Wilks normality test results. Categorical variables were tested by Chi-square or Fisher test. By multivariable regression analysis, CT findings, CT texture analysis, CT findings combined with texture analysis prediction models were established. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the diagnostic performance of individual indicators and each prediction model. The Delong test was used to compare the area under the curve (AUC) of each model. Results: The CT findings prediction model consisted of CT value of lesion on pancreatic parenchymal phase and pancreatic duct penetrating sign. The texture analysis prediction model consists of root mean square and low grey level run emphasis_angle135. The AUC of them were not statistically different (Z=0.150,P>0.05). The combined predictive model had the better diagnostic performance (AUC 0.944, sensitivity 83.0%, specificity 95.2%, +LR 17.43, -LR 0.18) than CT sign prediction model (Z=2.008, P<0.05) and texture analysis prediction model(Z=2.236, P<0.05) were significantly different. Conclusions: The CT findings model and the texture analysis model have equivalent diagnostic performance in the differentiation of mass-forming pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. The enhanced CT combined with texture analysis model has the best diagnostic efficiency and can further improve the diagnostic ability.",2019,Zhonghua yi xue za zhi
Protein-protein interaction network construction for cancer using a new L1/2-penalized Net-SVM model.,"Identifying biomarker genes and characterizing interaction pathways with high-dimensional and low-sample size microarray data is a major challenge in computational biology. In this field, the construction of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks using disease-related selected genes has garnered much attention. Support vector machines (SVMs) are commonly used to classify patients, and a number of useful tools such as lasso, elastic net, SCAD, or other regularization methods can be combined with SVM models to select genes that are related to a disease. In the current study, we propose a new Net-SVM model that is different from other SVM models as it is combined with L1/2-norm regularization, which has good performance with high-dimensional and low-sample size microarray data for cancer classification, gene selection, and PPI network construction. Both simulation studies and real data experiments demonstrated that our proposed method outperformed other regularization methods such as lasso, SCAD, and elastic net. In conclusion, our model may help to select fewer but more relevant genes, and can be used to construct simple and informative PPI networks that are highly relevant to cancer.",2016,Genetics and molecular research : GMR

Cancer survivor. Benefits of thermal treatment,"The current approach to cancer has resulted in prolonged survival thanks to the improvement of treatments and care. In Spain it is estimated that there are around 1,500,000 survivors and an increase of 50% is foreseen for the year 2020. 
According to the Cancer Institute of the United States, ""when it comes to cancer, survival covers the physical, psychosocial and economic problems of cancer, from diagnosis to the end of life. It focuses on the health and life of a person with cancer beyond the phases of diagnosis and treatment. Survival includes matters related to the ability to obtain medical assistance, follow-up, attention to late effects of treatment, second primary cancers and quality of life. Relatives, friends and caregivers are also part of the survival experience. "" 
The care of the survivors is one more stage of the continuous care of the oncological patient that, among other questions, involves the follow-up after the primary treatment, detection of second primary neoplasms or relapses, prevention and early treatment of alterations of the psychological state secondary to the cancer or its treatment. , monitoring of the complications of the treatment while it is being carried out and that persist after its completion, and of the later effects that manifest themselves later and that may affect different organs - accumulated organ toxicity - and tissues, generating aesthetic and functional consequences of different intensity and severity, as well as providing psychosocial support. 
In addition, survivors have a higher risk of suffering from other health problems such as obesity, heart failure, osteoporosis, high blood pressure, endocrinopathies or cognitive disorders. Obesity, which in turn, has been linked to an increased risk of recurrence and death in several types of cancer, such as breast, colorectal and prostate cancers. 
There is enough evidence of how lifestyle can influence the appearance and development of some tumors, but also how they can improve the quality of life during and after cancer treatments. Thermal and thalassotherapy centers can offer programs for the treatment of these second effects or ""collateral damage"", such as weight gain, asthenia, changes in the skin and mucous membranes or joint pain, including group behavior interventions, as well as education for health, to return to normalization and maintain a good quality of life.",2018,
"QTL mapping, validation and candidate genes analysis for plant height in maize","Plant height is one of the most important agronomic traits closely associated with biomass, lodging resistance and grain yield in maize.

 two QTLs associated with plant height (PH) using the least absolute shrinkage selection operator (LASSO) method were identified. QTLs detected in this study were validated to find the stability and consistency in different environments. A total of 12
 QTLs detected in this study were similar to earlier reported QTLs, which may be the most reliable and stable. Genes underlying these QTLs (+50 kb from the significant markers) were analyzed and 10 genes were predicted as candidate genes for PH. The

A class of operator splitting methods for least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) models,"Sparsity of statistical models is important to interpret high dimensional data. Linear regression models with sparsity have various applications in many real-world processes, including signal processing, image processing, gene selection and comparative genomic hybridization. Commonly, it involves heavy computation for combinatorial search for finding such models with sparsity by model selection. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) is a popular technique for model selection and estimation in linear regression to induce sparsity. In this thesis, we study several general LASSO models, including group LASSO, sparse group LASSO and fused LASSO. We focus on the applications of alternating direction method (ADM) of multipliers to these LASSO models, including the applications of ADM to LASSO and group LASSO, and a linearized version of ADM to sparse group LASSO and fused LASSO. This approach can solve large scale problems efficiently. Some numerical study for colon cancer and leukemia cancer data sets are reported.",2013,
Quantile regression with group lasso for classification,"Applications of regression models for binary response are very common and models specific to these problems are widely used. Quantile regression for binary response data has recently attracted attention and regularized quantile regression methods have been proposed for high dimensional problems. When the predictors have a natural group structure, such as in the case of categorical predictors converted into dummy variables, then a group lasso penalty is used in regularized methods. In this paper, we present a Bayesian Gibbs sampling procedure to estimate the parameters of a quantile regression model under a group lasso penalty for classification problems with a binary response. Simulated and real data show a good performance of the proposed method in comparison to mean-based approaches and to quantile-based approaches which do not exploit the group structure of the predictors.",2016,Advances in Data Analysis and Classification

A Fused-Lasso-Based Doppler Imaging Algorithm for Spinning Targets With Occlusion Effect,"The occlusion effect of targets with the spinning motion is usually ubiquitous when illuminated by the radar. Considering this effect in a single range Doppler imaging for spinning targets is of practical significance. In this paper, we develop a novel approach to image spinning targets with occlusion effect, which is referred to as a fused-Lasso-based Doppler-only snapshot imaging. Due to the spinning motion, the radar illuminates different parts of the target at each observation instant, which causes the backscattering intensities of the scatterers, are slowly time-varying. The 2D fused-Lasso model is introduced to capture this time-varying characteristic. Furthermore, the underlying factors for the imaging performance are thoughtfully analyzed.

"Filterâ€feeding Ducks of the Kafue Flats, Zambia, 1971â€“1973","Summary 
 
The occurrence, chronology of breeding and wing-moult, and feeding habits of seven commonly occurring species of filter-feeding ducks on the Kafue Flats in Zambia are described, based on 20 aerial surveys over the central section of floodplain and intensive observations on the ground at Lochinvar National Park, between October 1970 and January 1974. 
 
 
 
At high flood levels ducks were almost restricted to areas heavily utilized by lechwe; this association persisted until the floodplain became dry, but during the dry season ducks were also found on vegetated lagoons. Five speciesâ€”Dendrocygna bicolor, Dendrocygna viduata, Thalassornis leuconotus, Netta erythropthalma and Anas erythrorhynchaâ€”were most abundant between June and September; a sixthâ€”Anas punctataâ€”was most abundant between December and March, while the seventhâ€”Anas undulataâ€”was probably resident. At times the numbers of D. bicolor, D. viduata and A. erythrorhyncha probably exceeded 25 000; those of N. erythropthalma reached 6500, but the numbers of T. leuconotus, A. punctata and A. undulata were much lower and at Lochinvar did not exceed 500. 
 
 
 
Small numbers of D. bicolor, N. erythropthalma, A. punctata and A. undulata nested on the floodplain in the vicinity of Lochinvar between March and July. All seven species completed their wing-moult between April and October in the area; large numbers, particularly of A. erythrorhyncha and D. bicolor, were involved. 
 
 
 
At Lochinvar, A. punctata fed mainly on aquatic invertebrates; the remaining species fed largely on shed fruits and seeds. The most important food plants were a terrestrial herb, Ambrosia maritima (Januaryâ€“April), two aquatic herbs, Nymphaea capensis and Nymphoides indica (Mayâ€“August), and two aquatic grasses, Echinochloa stagnina and Vossia cuspidata (Septemberâ€“December). The herbs grew where grassland had been suppressed by lechwe; fruits of the aquatic grasses were found where lechwe had removed the overlying mat of stems. Despite similarities in diet the ducks differed from each other in feeding behaviour and/or preferred habitat. 
 
 
 
Five other species of filter-feeding ducks, Anas capensis, Anas smithii, Anas clypeata, Anas acuta and Anas querquedula, have been recorded from the Flats, but all are rare.",2008,Ibis
Intestinal parasites from the 2nd-5th century AD latrine in the Roman Baths at Sagalassos (Turkey).,"The aim of this research was to determine the species of intestinal parasite present in a Roman Imperial period population in Asia Minor, and to use this information to improve our understanding of health in the eastern Mediterranean region in Roman times. We analyzed five samples from the latrines of the Roman bath complex at Sagalassos, Turkey. Fecal biomarker analysis using 5Î²-stanols has indicated the feces were of human origin. The eggs of roundworm (Ascaris) were identified in all five samples using microscopy, and the cysts of the protozoan Giardia duodenalis (which causes dysentery) were identified multiple times in one sample using ELISA. The positive G. duodenalis result at Sagalassos is particularly important as it represents the earliest reliable evidence for this parasite in the Old World (i.e. outside the Americas). As both these species of parasite are spread through the contamination of food and water by fecal material, their presence implies that Roman sanitation technologies such as latrines and public baths did not break the cycle of reinfection in this population. We then discuss the evidence for roundworm in the writings of the Roman physician Galen, who came from Pergamon, another town in western Asia Minor.",2017,International journal of paleopathology
Two predictive precision medicine tools for hepatocellular carcinoma,"BackgroundHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a serious threat to public health due to its poor prognosis. The current study aimed to develop and validate a prognostic nomogram to predict the overall survival of HCC patients.MethodsThe model cohort consisted of 24,991 mRNA expression data points from 348 HCC patients. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method (LASSO) Cox regression model was used to evaluate the prognostic mRNA biomarkers for the overall survival of HCC patients.ResultsUsing multivariate Cox proportional regression analyses, a prognostic nomogram (named Eight-mRNA prognostic nomogram) was constructed based on the expression data of N4BP3, -ADRA2B, E2F8, MAPT, PZP, HOXD9, COL15A1, and -NDST3. The C-index of the Eight-mRNA prognostic nomogram was 0.765 (95% CI 0.724â€“0.806) for the overall survival in the model cohort. The Harrellâ€™s concordance-index of the Eight-mRNA prognostic nomogram was 0.715 (95% CI 0.658â€“0.772) in the validation cohort. The survival curves demonstrated that the HCC patients in the high risk group had a significantly poorer overall survival than the patients in the low risk group.ConclusionIn the current study, we have developed two convenient and efficient predictive precision medicine tools for hepatocellular carcinoma. These two predictive precision medicine tools are helpful for predicting the individual mortality risk probability and improving the personalized comprehensive treatments for HCC patients.

Reference point insensitive molecular data analysis,"MOTIVATION
In biomedicine, every molecular measurement is relative to a reference point, like a fixed aliquot of RNA extracted from a tissue, a defined number of blood cells, or a defined volume of biofluid. Reference points are often chosen for practical reasons. For example, we might want to assess the metabolome of a diseased organ but can only measure metabolites in blood or urine. In this case, the observable data only indirectly reflects the disease state. The statistical implications of these discrepancies in reference points have not yet been discussed.


RESULTS
Here, we show that reference point discrepancies compromise the performance of regression models like the LASSO. As an alternative, we suggest zero-sum regression for a reference point insensitive analysis. We show that zero-sum regression is superior to the LASSO in case of a poor choice of reference point both in simulations and in an application that integrates intestinal microbiome analysis with metabolomics. Moreover, we describe a novel coordinate descent based algorithm to fit zero-sum elastic nets.

Lymphocytes Can Be Induced to Differentiate to CD 5 B Lymphocytes With Germinal Center Cell Features,"H UMAN B LYMPHOCYTES that express the T-ceblassociated antigen CD5 (CD5 B cells) are the major B cell population that forms primary follicles in fetal lymph nodes and spleenâ€™3 and circulates in cord blood.4 After birth, the proportion of these cells decreases. CD5 B cells are I 5% to 20% of all B cells in adult human blood and spleen and 5% to 10% of all B cells in tonsils and lymph nodes. 6 This numerically minor B cell population has been rebated to the development of B-cell chronic lymphoid malignancies and autoimmune disorders. The CD5 molecule is expressed by the monoclonab B cells of B-chronic bymphocytic leukemia B-CLL,7 which is the most frequent leukemia in adults. Normal CD5 B lymphocytes produce rheumatoid factor and auto-antibodies (Abs) to single-stranded DNA3â€™8 and are increased in the peripheral blood of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA),3â€™9 but no such cells could be demonstrated at the site of immune activation in the rheumatoid synovium. Thus, involvement of CD5 B cell subset in human autoimmune diseases is still controversial. In contrast, Lyl B cells, the murine homobog of human CD5 B cells, undoubtedly costitutiveby produce 1gM auto-Abs and are highly represented in NZB mice, the murine equivalent of human systemic lupus We wished to determine what regulates the cell cycle of normal CD5 B cells and how they relate to â€œconventionalâ€ CD5 B lymphocytes. We demonstrated that a significant proportion ofcord blood CD5 B cells express the activation molecules CD23, CD25, and transferrin receptor and are in the cell cycle. These cells can be induced to proliferate further by interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, or low-molecular-weight B-cell growth factor (lmw-BCGF): when exposed to IL-i and IL-2, these cells lose sIgD and CD5 and acquire CD1O and CD38 molecules. These findings indicate that CD5 B lymphocytes are preactivated and, in the presence of the lymphokines presumably recreating the suitable microenvironment, give rise to CD5 B cells with the features of B blasts proliferating in the germinal centers of secondary follicles.",2005,

"OLS, LASSO dan PLS Pada data Mengandung Multikolinearitas","Correlation between predictor variables (multicollinearity) become a problem in regression analysis. There are some methods to solve the problem and each method has its own complexity. This research aims to explore performance of OLS, LASSO and PLS on data that have correlation between predictor variables. OLS establishes model by minimizing sum square of residual. LASSO minimizes sum square of residual subject to sum of absolute coefficient less than a constant and PLS combine principal component analysis and multiple linear regression. By analyzing simulation and real data using R program, results of this research are that for data with serious multicollinearity (there are high correlations between predictor variables), LASSO tend to have lower bias average than PLS in prediction of response variable. OLS method has the greatest variance of MSEP, that is mostly not consistent in estimating the Mean Square Error Prediction (MSEP). MSEP that is resulted by using PLS is less than that by using LASSO.",2010,
"Hume's Correlationism: On Meillassoux, Necessity and Belief","The article argues that Meillassoux's 'After Finitude' underestimates the nature and profundity of Hume's sceptical challenge; it neglects the fact that Hume's scepticism concerns final causes (and agrees fundamentally with Bacon and Descartes in this respect), and that in Hume even the operations of reason do not furnish entirely a priori knowledge. We contend that Hume himself institutes a form of correlationism (which in part showed Kant the way to counter the sceptical challenge via transcendental idealism), and sought not merely to abolish the 'principle of sufficient reason' but to salvage it in a weak form, in turning his attention to the grounds for our beliefs in necessity. We argue further that the 'mathematizability' of properties is not a sufficient criterion to yield realist, non-correlational knowledge, or to demonstrate the 'irremediable realism' of the 'ancestral' statement. Finally, we contend that Meillassoux himself relies on a certain 'Kantian moment' which exempts the reasoning subject from otherwise 'omnipotent' chaos, and that ultimately the 'speculative materialist' position remains exposed to the original Humean sceptical challenge.",2013,Journal of French and Francophone Philosophy
Book Reviews,"Modern forestry is a very important sector of the Swedish economy. Despite of a very intensive wood exploitation (1.8% word production) the area of forests in Sweden is growing bigger all the time due to the efforts made by the forestry service of this country. The scientists who conduct research concerning forest ecosystems in Sweden are also a great help in modernizing the forest economy. One of the very important research projects made in Sweden is a multidisciplinary Sustainable Forestry in Southern Sweden (SUFOR) Project. It is run on the area of GÃ¶taland, in the southern Sweden. Almost 80% of this land consists of lowlands and the most important are Holland and Kalmar situated at the seaside. The middle part is covered by the SmÃ¥land upland, which is not higher than 380 m above the sea level. The climate of GÃ¶taland is moderate due to the warm north Atlantic current. The book Sustainable Forestry in Southern Sweden edited by Cristina Blennow and Mats Niklasson proves to be a very rich source of information concerning the research conduced in the forests of GÃ¶taland. The volume is divided into three chapters: I. The SUFOR setting: (1) Introduction to the SUFOR Program, (2) Biodiversity and sustainable forestry in changing landscapes-principles and southern Sweden as an example, (3) How to cross the valley of death-reflections on communication. II. Linking basics and management: (1) Deer browsing and impact on forest development, (2) Tracing the impact of adverse environmental conditions on the forest sensitivity in trees, (3) Functional biodiversity aspects on the nutrient sustainable in forests-importance of root distribution, (4) Mixed forests as a part of sustainable forestry in southern Sweden, (5) Estimating weathering rates of Swedish forest soils in different scales. Using the PROFILE model and affiliated databases. III. Synthesis: (1) Trade-offs in forest utilization from a sustainability perspective, (2) Application of natural, social, and economical sustainability limitations to forest management, based on Swedish experiences, (3) Multi-objective forest landscape projection modelling-problems and prospects, (4) Decision support for active risk management in sustainable forestry, (5) Sustainability and biodiversity: from policy to implementation, with examples from Swedish forests, and (6) Policy implications of the SUFOR Program. At the end of each chapter a reader can find literature covering the issues presented in the book. The book also contains the index. Nowadays, the priorities concerning functions of forests are changing because of the new expectations of the society, as well as of the growing threat to many factors. They are the main source of the changes in the environment caused by the human activities and as the consequence there is a constant demand for the improvement of the forestry economy and forestersâ€™ qualifications. If there is no approval and social support for the forestersâ€™ activities, it will be difficult to execute the protective, social and productive functions of forests.

CA9 transcriptional expression determines prognosis and tumour grade in tongue squamous cell carcinoma patients.,"CA9 is a member of the carbonic anhydrases' family, that is often expressed in cancer cells under hypoxic condition. However, the role of CA9 in the molecular mechanisms of tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) pathogenesis remains unclear. CA9 expression was analysed using the TCGA database, and its influence on survival was performed using Kaplan-Meier, LASSO and COX regression analyses. The correlation between CA9 and immune infiltration was investigated by CIBERSORT and ESTIMATE. Moreover, the relationship between CA9 expression and downstream molecular regulation pathways was analysed by GSEA, GO and WGCNA. CA9 expression correlated with clinical prognosis and tumour grade in TSCC. Moreover, CA9 expression potentially contributes to the regulation of cancer cell differentiation and mediates tumour-associated genes and signalling pathways, including apoptosis, hypoxia, G2M checkpoint, PI3K/AKR/mTOR signalling and TGF-beta signalling pathways. However, the follicular helper T cells, regulatory T cells, immune and stromal scores showed no significance between high and low CA9 expression groups. These findings suggested that CA9 plays a critical role of TSCC prognosis and tumour grade. CA9 expression significantly correlated with the regulation of cell differentiation, various oncogenes and cancer-associated pathways.",2020,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine
Dal russamento alle apnee del sonno,"I russamenti sono frequenti e possono essere associati a delle apnee/ipopnee. Essi sono legati al collasso faringeo durante il sonno e, secondo lâ€™importanza di questo, si osservano un russamento semplice, delle limitazioni inspiratorie di flusso, delle ipopnee e delle apnee. La sindrome delle apnee-ipopnee ostruttive del sonno (SAIOS) e definita da un numero di apnee e/o di ipopnee superiore a 5/h e la SAIOS e grave se lâ€™indice di apnee-ipopnee (IAI) e superiore a 30/h. Di fronte a un russamento, e importante escludere una SAIOS a causa delle sue conseguenze importanti sulla salute: sonnolenza con conseguente rischio di incidenti e ripercussione cardiovascolare (ipertensione arteriosa, malattia coronarica, disturbi del ritmo, ecc.) e metabolica (diabete, epatite steatosica, ecc.). La diagnosi si basa su registrazioni realizzate durante il sonno, o complete (polisonnografia) o valutando solo i parametri respiratori (poligrafia). Il ricorso allâ€™uno o allâ€™altro di questi due esami prende in considerazione i sintomi del paziente e il sospetto di patologie del sonno associate. Le possibilita terapeutiche sono molteplici e dipendono dalla gravita della roncopatia: chirurgia di riduzione tissutale tipo palatoplastica per un russamento semplice, ortesi di avanzamento mandibolare per una SAIOS moderata sonnolenta, ventilazione notturna in pressione positiva per una SAIOS grave e cosi via.

Impact of diastolic dysfunction on the outcome of catheter ablation in patients with atrial fibrillation.,"OBJECTIVE
To evaluate the impact of diastolic dysfunction on the outcome of atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation.


METHODS
Eighty consecutive patients with drug-refractory symptomatic AF who underwent AF ablation were enrolled (65 males, 58 Â± 10 years, 65 paroxysmal AF, 15 persistent AF). All patients underwent extensive pulmonary vein isolation with a double lasso technique using CARTO MERGE. Diastolic dysfunction was defined as a ratio of the mitral inflow early filling velocity to the velocity of the early medial mitral annular ascent of >10. The clinical and echocardiographic data were compared between the patients with and without diastolic dysfunction, and between the patients with and without AF recurrences after the AF ablation.


RESULTS
Twenty-nine out of all the patients (36.3%) had diastolic dysfunction. Compared with the patients without diastolic dysfunction, the patients with diastolic dysfunction had higher brain natriuretic peptide (p=0.001) and C-reactive protein (p=0.023) levels, and a larger left atrial diameter (P=0.019). The AF-free rate after a single or repeat AF ablation procedure in the patients with diastolic dysfunction was lower than that in those without diastolic dysfunction (p=0.005 and p=0.013 by the log-rank test, respectively). In the univariate analysis, the patients with persistent AF and diastolic dysfunction were likely to have AF recurrences after a single AF ablation. The multivariate analysis indicated diastolic dysfunction as the only independent predictor of an AF recurrence after a single AF ablation (P=0.023).


CONCLUSION
The patients with diastolic dysfunction had a worse outcome of the AF ablation not only for a single procedure but also a repeat procedure.",2013,International journal of cardiology
Comparison of the Leaching Behaviour of Alachlor and its Metabolites Under Field and Laboratory Conditions,"The aim of the investigation was to evaluate whether the results of field studies and those obtained from soil column experiments are comparable in order to describe leaching behaviour of pesticides. The fate of Alachlor and its metabolites 2,6-diethylaniline and 2-chloro-2',6-diethylacetanilide are described in this paper. Field leaching study and laboratory soil column experiments carried out with the formulated herbicide LASSOÂ® gave similar results. Applied Alachlor remained mostly in the top 10 cm soil layer representing a limited mobility. Very small amounts of Alachlor in ground and percolated water indicated only a slight leaching potential. The calculated half-life of 15 days and 90% loss after 335 days demonstrate a remarkable persistence of alachlor. Only 2-chloro-2',6'-diethylacetanilide but not 2,6-diethylaniline was detected in soil and percolated water. It is still uncertain if these residues originate from the formulated product or result partially from metabolism. Column experiments with the same soil carried out under undisturbed conditions are a simple alternative to field studies and allow quantitative estimations. The column experiments support the assumption that most of the alachlor that cannot be found after application is not lost by wind drifting or volatilization but due to formation of bound residues.",1995,International Journal of Environmental Analytical Chemistry
Cross-product Penalized Component Analysis (XCAN),"Matrix factorization methods are extensively employed to understand complex data. In this paper, we introduce the cross-product penalized component analysis (XCAN), a sparse matrix factorization based on the optimization of a loss function that allows a trade-off between variance maximization and structural preservation. The approach is based on previous developments, notably (i) the Sparse Principal Component Analysis (SPCA) framework based on the LASSO, (ii) extensions of SPCA to constrain both modes of the factorization, like co-clustering or the Penalized Matrix Decomposition (PMD), and (iii) the Group-wise Principal Component Analysis (GPCA) method. The result is a flexible modeling approach that can be used for data exploration in a large variety of problems. We demonstrate its use with applications from different disciplines.",2019,ArXiv
Bridging the Gap: A Research-Based Approach for Teaching Interdisciplinary Science to Undergraduate Freshman Students.,"COLLEGE SCIENCE TEACHING M any studies published within the past decade evaluating college science teaching have resonated with a common theme: Teach what you practice (Deutch 1994; Dimaculangan et al. 2000; Glasson and McKenzie 1997; Gottfried et al. 1993; Harker 1999; Lawson 1999; Stukus and Lennox 1995; Tolman 1999). This common-sense advice often gets lost in the demands for covering the increasingly voluminous background materials of introductory science courses, and the process of scientifi c discovery is lost. Specifi cally, three common recommendations for changes in college science teaching are: (1) Place an emphasis on science as it is practiced by scientists rather than simply verifying information that is already known (Stukus and Lennox 1995; Lawson 1999; Leonard 1991), (2) Engage students in the design and conduct of scientifi c research that promotes independent learning and critical thinking (Tolman 1999; Dimaculangan et al. 2000), and (3) Increase emphasis on the studentsâ€™ ability to effectively present and communicate scientifi c information. Related to these recommendations, Gottfried and colleagues (1993) suggest that college science instruction should demonstrate the nature of science by specifi cally introducing students to the processes and methods of scientifi c discovery. As a means to develop critical-thinking skills and facilitate understanding of science, students should formulate and test hypotheses, design experiments, develop research plans, control variables, and communicate scientifi c ideas. In response to these suggestions and with initial funding provided by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Emory College, and the Emory School of Medicine, we introduced a program entitled On Recent Discoveries by Emory Researchers (ORDER).

"Fish Remains as Indicators of Changes in Environment, Technology, and Sociopolitical Organization on Santa Cruz Island","Author(s): Gusick, Amy E.; Glassow, Michael G.; Paige, Peter F. | Abstract: Subsistence strategies of the hunter-gatherer-fishers who inhabited the Northern Channel Islands have included fishingsince at least 9,000 B.P. While there has been a steady increase of fish meat to the diet over this extended time period, there was a pronounced increase identified during the Middle and Late periods (2,600 â€“ 200 B.P.). This increase occurred during a time of significant technological innovation, marked population growth, and expansive environmental stress. Recent data collected from numerous sites across the Northern Channel Islands have been critical in understanding the behavioral response to the significant environmental stress and cultural changes characteristic of the transition from the Middle Period to the Late Period on the Islands. We contribute to this growing body of data with an analysis of fish remains from CA-SCRI-195, a well-preserved site deposit on Santa Cruz Island that spans a 1,500-year time period inclusive of the Middle and Late periods. The data from CA-SCRI-195 suggest that evidence of environmental variation, technological development, and changes in sociopolitical organization can all be identified in the data and all uniquely contributed to subsistence changes identified at the site. The patterns of distribution and the trends apparent in the identified fish remains from this study are an important contribution to the larger goal of understanding developments in economic and sociopolitical organization on the Northern Channel Islands.",2015,Journal of California and Great Basin Anthropology
Change-Point Estimation in High Dimensional Regression Models,"We consider high dimensional nonhomogeneous linear regression models with p n 9 0 or p >> n, where p is the number of features and n is the number of observations. In the model considered, the underlying true regression coefficients undergo multiple changes. Our goal is to estimate the number and locations of these change-points and estimate sparse coefficients in each of the intervals between changepoints. This paper develops an approach to solve multiple change-points estimation problem in high dimensional linear regression model based on sparse group Lasso (SGL). We analyze the performance of our approach and prove several consistency results. In particular, under certain assumptions and using a properly chosen regularization parameter, we show that the estimation errors of linear coefficients and change-point locations can be expressed as functions of n, p and s, where s is the sparse level of each coefficient. From these functions, we can understand how the estimation errors scale with system parameters and identify conditions on system parameters under which the estimation errors diminish. Furthermore, we show that the estimation of change-points is always overfitting, which eliminates the risk of missing true change-points, and the isolated estimated change-points between true change-points does not occur, which implies that the estimated change-points are clustered around the true change points. We further extend our studies to general linear models (GLM) and prove similar results. Numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of our approach.",2016,
Regularized Bayesian estimation for GEV-B-splines model,"Abstract Large observed datasets are not stationary and/or depend on covariates, especially, in the case of extreme hydrometeorological variables. This causes the difficulty in estimation, using classical hydrological frequency analysis. A number of non-stationary models have been developed using linear or quadratic polynomial functions or B-splines functions to estimate the relationship between parameters and covariates. In this article, we propose regularised generalized extreme value model with B-splines (GEV-B-splines models) in a Bayesian framework to estimate quantiles. Regularisation is based on penalty and aims to favour parsimonious model especially in the case of large dimension space. Penalties are introduced in a Bayesian framework and the corresponding priors are detailed. Five penalties are considered and the corresponding priors are developed for comparison purpose as: Least absolute shrinkage and selection (Lasso and Ridge) and smoothing clipped absolute deviations (SCAD) methods (SCAD1, SCAD2 and SCAD3). Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms have been developed for each model to estimate quantiles and their posterior distributions. Those approaches are tested and illustrated using simulated data with different sample sizes. A first simulation was made on polynomial B-splines functions in order to choose the most efficient model in terms of relative mean biais (RMB) and the relative mean-error (RME) criteria. A second simulation was performed with the SCAD1 penalty for sinusoidal dependence to illustrate the flexibility of the proposed approach. Results show clearly that the regularized approaches leads to a significant reduction of the bias and the mean square error, especially for small sample sizes (nÂ <Â 100). A case study has been considered to model annual peak flows at Fort-Kent catchment with the total annual precipitations as covariates. The conditional quantile curves were given for the regularized and the maximum likelihood methods.",2016,Stochastic Environmental Research and Risk Assessment
Group-lasso Estimation in High-dimensional Factor Models with Structural Breaks,"In this major paper, we study the influence of structural breaks in the financial market model with high-dimensional data. We present a model which is capable of detecting changes in factor loadings, determining the number of factors and detecting the break date. We consider the case where the break date is both known and unknown and identify the type of instability. For the unknown break date case, we propose a group-LASSO estimator to determine the number of preand post-break factors, the break date and the existence of instability of factor loadings when the number of factor is constant. We also present the asymptotic properties of penalized least square estimator with both the cross-sections and the time dimensions tend to infinity. Further, we develop a cross-validation procedure to obtain the tuning parameters to fine-tune the penalty terms and use the least square approach to estimate the break date after the number of factors is obtained. We also present a Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate the performance of the proposed procedure and analyze real data from 2007-09 Great Recession. The proposed procedure generally detects the break date correctly during the Great Recession while the procedure performs relatively poorly in estimating the number of factors in the preand post-break date case.",2018,
Growth of HIV-1 Molecular Transmission Clusters in New York City,"Background
HIV-1 genetic sequences can be used to infer viral transmission history and dynamics. Throughout the United States, HIV-1 sequences from drug resistance testing are reported to local public health departments.


Methods
We investigated whether inferred HIV transmission network dynamics can identify individuals and clusters of individuals most likely to give rise to future HIV cases in a surveillance setting. We used HIV-TRACE, a genetic distance-based clustering tool, to infer molecular transmission clusters from HIV-1 pro/RT sequences from 65736 people in the New York City surveillance registry. Logistic and LASSO regression analyses were used to identify correlates of clustering and cluster growth, respectively. We performed retrospective transmission network analyses to evaluate individual- and cluster-level prioritization schemes for identifying parts of the network most likely to give rise to new cases in the subsequent year.


Results
Individual-level prioritization schemes predicted network growth better than random targeting. Across the 3600 inferred molecular transmission clusters, previous growth dynamics were superior predictors of future transmission cluster growth compared to individual-level prediction schemes. Cluster-level prioritization schemes considering previous cluster growth relative to cluster size further improved network growth predictions.


Conclusions
Prevention efforts based on HIV molecular epidemiology may improve public health outcomes in a US surveillance setting.",2018,The Journal of Infectious Diseases
Development and validation of a nomogram based on CT images and 3D texture analysis for preoperative prediction of the malignant potential in gastrointestinal stromal tumors,"Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), which are the most common mesenchymal tumors of the digestive system, are treated varyingly according to the malignancy. The purpose of this study is to develop and validate a nomogram for preoperative prediction of the malignant potential in patients with GIST. A total of 440 patients with pathologically confirmed GIST after surgery in our hospital from January 2011 to July 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. They were randomly divided into the training set (nâ€‰=â€‰308) and validation set (nâ€‰=â€‰132). CT signs and texture features of each patient were analyzed and predictive model were developed using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) regression. Then a nomogram based on selected parameters was developed. The predictive effectiveness of nomogram was evaluated by the area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). Concordance index (C-index) and calibration plots were formulated to evaluate the reliability and accuracy of the nomogram by bootstrapping based on internal (training set) and external (validation set) validity. The clinical application value of the nomogram was determined through the decision curve analysis (DCA). Totally 156 GIST patients with low-malignant (very low and low risk) and 284 ones with high-malignant potential (intermediate and high risk) are enrolled in this study. The prediction nomogram consisting of size, cystoid variation and meanValue had an excellent discrimination both in training and validation sets (AUCs (95% confidence interval(CI)): 0.935 (0.908, 0.961), 0.933 (0.892, 0.974); C-indices (95% CI): 0.941 (0.912, 0.956), 0.935 (0.901, 0.982); sensitivity: 81.4, 90.6%; specificity: 75.0, 75.7%; accuracy: 88.0, 88.6%, respectively). The calibration curves indicated a good consistency between the actual observation and nomogram prediction for differentiating GIST malignancy. Decision curve analysis demonstrated that the nomogram was clinically useful. This study presents a prediction nomogram that incorporates the CT signs and texture parameter, which can be conveniently used to facilitate the preoperative individualized prediction of malignancy in GIST patients.",2020,Cancer Imaging
Implementations of geographically weighted lasso in spatial data with multicollinearity (Case study: Poverty modeling of Java Island),"Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) is a regression model that takes into account the spatial heterogeneity effect. In the application of the GWR, inference on regression coefficients is often of interest, as is estimation and prediction of the response variable. Empirical research and studies have demonstrated that local correlation between explanatory variables can lead to estimated regression coefficients in GWR that are strongly correlated, a condition named multicollinearity. It later results on a large standard error on estimated regression coefficients, and, hence, problematic for inference on relationships between variables. Geographically Weighted Lasso (GWL) is a method which capable to deal with spatial heterogeneity and local multicollinearity in spatial data sets. GWL is a further development of GWR method, which adds a LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) constraint in parameter estimation.

Multistep model for predicting upper-limb 3D isometric force application from pre-movement electrocorticographic features.,"Neural correlates of movement planning onset and direction may be present in human electrocorticography in the signal dynamics of both motor and non-motor cortical regions. We use a three-stage model of jPCA reduced-rank hidden Markov model (jPCA-RR-HMM), regularized shrunken-centroid discriminant analysis (RDA), and LASSO regression to extract direction-sensitive planning information and movement onset in an upper-limb 3D isometric force task in a human subject. This mode achieves a relatively high true positive force-onset prediction rate of 60% within 250ms, and an above-chance 36% accuracy (17% chance) in predicting one of six planned 3D directions of isometric force using pre-movement signals. We also find direction-distinguishing information up to 400ms before force onset in the pre-movement signals, captured by electrodes placed over the limb-ipsilateral dorsal premotor regions. This approach can contribute to more accurate decoding of higher-level movement goals, at earlier timescales, and inform sensor placement. Our results also contribute to further understanding of the spatiotemporal features of human motor planning.",2016,Conference proceedings : ...

L'eloignement chronique, le statut de SDF sur les documents, engendrent des difficultes d'insertion. Leur retour vers le monde du travail passe par le developpement de leurs propres emplois. L'Unisat (Union nationale des institutions sociales d'action pour les Tsiganes) anime le projet Codipe (Contre la discrimination, pour l'emploi) pour developper des formations adaptees, un test d'activites et structures innovantes, et des outils d'accompagnement. Ainsi, l'Association des amis des Voyageurs de la Gironde (Adav 33), membre de l'Unisat, travaille avec l'Afpa, le Centre academique de formation de l'administration, et les Compagnons du devoir. Ils vont creer un Reseau grand Sud-Ouest, avec de multiples initiatives de formation et d'information. Dans le Morbihan, l'association Reseaux d'accueil de Lorient a lance Genesis' (programme en faveur de l'insertion professionnelle et economique des Gens du voyage du departement du Morbihan), une formation Gerer sa micro-entreprise individuelle, etc. Dans les Hautes-Pyrenees, Solidarite avec les Gens du voyage 65 (SAGV 65) a prepare des kits mallettes sur la gestion administrative de l'activite independante. En Haute-Savoie, lAssociation logement, accueil et promotion des travailleurs et familles (Alap) lutte contre l'illettrisme et promeut une cooperative sociale. A la fin de l'annee 2005, les partenaires de Codipe souhaitent lancer la troisieme phase du projet, qui correspondra a la capitalisation et la diffusion des resultats du projet.",2005,
Support Union Recovery in High-dimensional Multivariate Regression,"multivariate group Lasso, in which block regularization based on the â€˜1/â€˜2 norm is used for support union recovery, or recovery of the set of s rows for which B is non-zero. Under high-dimensional scaling, we show that the multivariate group Lasso exhibits a threshold for the recovery of the exact row pattern with high probability over the random design and noise that is specified by the sample complexity parameter (n,p,s) := n/[2 (B )log(p s)]. Here n is the sample size, and (B ) is a sparsity-overlap function measuring a combination of the sparsities and overlaps of the K-regression coecient vectors that constitute the model. We prove that the multivariate group Lasso succeeds for problem sequences (n,p,s) such that (n,p,s) exceeds a critical level u, and fails for sequences such that (n,p,s) lies below a critical level â€˜. For the special case of the standard Gaussian ensemble, we show that â€˜ = u so that the characterization is sharp. The sparsity-overlap function (B ) reveals that, if the design is uncorrelated on the active rows, â€˜1/â€˜2 regularization for multivariate regression never harms performance relative to an ordinary Lasso approach, and can yield substantial improvements in sample complexity (up to a factor of K) when the regression vectors are suitably orthogonal. For more general designs, it is possible for the ordinary Lasso to outperform the multivariate group Lasso. We complement our analysis with simulations that demonstrate the sharpness of our theoretical results, even for relatively small problems.",2011,Annals of Statistics
Predicting gene expression using DNA methylation in three human populations,"Background
DNA methylation, an important epigenetic mark, is well known for its regulatory role in gene expression, especially the negative correlation in the promoter region. However, its correlation with gene expression across genome at human population level has not been well studied. In particular, it is unclear if genome-wide DNA methylation profile of an individual can predict her/his gene expression profile. Previous studies were mostly limited to association analyses between single CpG site methylation and gene expression. It is not known whether DNA methylation of a gene has enough prediction power to serve as a surrogate for gene expression in existing human study cohorts with DNA samples other than RNA samples.


Results
We examined DNA methylation in the gene region for predicting gene expression across individuals in non-cancer tissues of three human population datasets, adipose tissue of the Multiple Tissue Human Expression Resource Projects (MuTHER), peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) from Asthma and normal control study participates, and lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) from healthy individuals. Three prediction models were investigated, single linear regression, multiple linear regression, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) penalized regression. Our results showed that LASSO regression has superior performance among these methods. However, the prediction power is generally low and varies across datasets. Only 30 and 42 genes were found to have cross-validation R2 greater than 0.3 in the PBMC and Adipose datasets, respectively. A substantially larger number of genes (258) were identified in the LCL dataset, which was generated from a more homogeneous cell line sample source. We also demonstrated that it gives better prediction power not to exclude any CpG probe due to cross hybridization or SNP effect.


Conclusion
In our three population analyses DNA methylation of CpG sites at gene region have limited prediction power for gene expression across individuals with linear regression models. The prediction power potentially varies depending on tissue, cell type, and data sources. In our analyses, the combination of LASSO regression and all probes not excluding any probe on the methylation array provides the best prediction for gene expression.",2019,PeerJ
Effect of top-down connections in Hierarchical Sparse Coding,"Hierarchical Sparse Coding (HSC) is a powerful model to efficiently represent multi-dimensional, structured data such as images. The simplest solution to solve this computationally hard problem is to decompose it into independent layer-wise subproblems. However, neuroscientific evidence would suggest inter-connecting these subproblems as in the Predictive Coding (PC) theory, which adds top-down connections between consecutive layers. In this study, a new model called 2-Layers Sparse Predictive Coding (2L-SPC) is introduced to assess the impact of this inter-layer feedback connection. In particular, the 2L-SPC is compared with a Hierarchical Lasso (Hi-La) network made out of a sequence of independent Lasso layers. The 2L-SPC and the 2-layers Hi-La networks are trained on 4 different databases and with different sparsity parameters on each layer. First, we show that the overall prediction error generated by 2L-SPC is lower thanks to the feedback mechanism as it transfers prediction error between layers. Second, we demonstrate that the inference stage of the 2L-SPC is faster to converge than for the Hi-La model. Third, we show that the 2L-SPC also accelerates the learning process. Finally, the qualitative analysis of both models dictionaries, supported by their activation probability, show that the 2L-SPC features are more generic and informative.",2020,ArXiv
Genomic Prediction and Genome-Wide Association Studies of Flour Yield and Alveograph Quality Traits Using Advanced Winter Wheat Breeding Material,"Use of genetic markers and genomic prediction might improve genetic gain for quality traits in wheat breeding programs. Here, flour yield and Alveograph quality traits were inspected in 635 F6 winter wheat breeding lines from two breeding cycles. Genome-wide association studies revealed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on chromosome 5D significantly associated with flour yield, Alveograph P (dough tenacity), and Alveograph W (dough strength). Additionally, SNPs on chromosome 1D were associated with Alveograph P and W, SNPs on chromosome 1B were associated with Alveograph P, and SNPs on chromosome 4A were associated with Alveograph L (dough extensibility). Predictive abilities based on genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) models ranged from 0.50 for flour yield to 0.79 for Alveograph W based on a leave-one-out cross-validation strategy. Predictive abilities were negatively affected by smaller training set sizes, lower genetic relationship between lines in training and validation sets, and by genotype-environment (GÃ—E) interactions. Bayesian Power Lasso models and genomic feature models resulted in similar or slightly improved predictions compared to GBLUP models. SNPs with the largest effects can be used for screening large numbers of lines in early generations in breeding programs to select lines that potentially have good quality traits. In later generations, genomic predictions might be used for a more accurate selection of high quality wheat lines.",2019,Genes
Novel radiomic signature as a prognostic biomarker for locally advanced rectal cancer,"BACKGROUND
Locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) patient stratification by clinicoradiologic factors may yield variable results. Therefore, more efficient prognostic biomarkers are needed for improved risk stratification of LARC patients, personalized treatment, and prognostication.


PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS
To compare the ability of a radiomic signature to predict disease-free survival (DFS) with that of a clinicoradiologic risk model in individual patients with LARC.


STUDY TYPE
Retrospective study.


POPULATION
In all, 108 consecutive patients (allocated to a training and validation set with a 1:1 ratio) with LARC treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) followed by total mesorectal excision (TME).


FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE
Axial 3D LAVA multienhanced MR sequence at 3T.


ASSESSMENT
ITK-SNAP software was used for manual segmentation of 3D pre-nCRT MR images. All manual tumor segmentations were performed by a gastrointestinal tract radiologist, and validated by a senior radiologist. The clinicoradiologic risk factors with potential prognostic outcomes were identified in univariate analysis based on the Cox regression model for the whole set. The results showed that ypT, ypN, EMVI, and MRF were potential clinicoradiologic risk factors. Interestingly, only ypN and MRF were identified as independent predictors in multivariate analysis based on the Cox regression model.


STATISTICAL TESTS
A radiomic signature based on 485 3D features was generated using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression model. The association of the radiomic signature with DFS was investigated by Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Survival curves were compared by the log-rank test. Three models were built and assessed for their predictive values, using the Harrell concordance index and integrated time-dependent area under the curve.


RESULTS
The novel radiomic signature stratified patients into low- and high-risk groups for DFS in the training set (hazard ratio [HR]â€‰=â€‰6.83; P < 0.001), and was successfully validated in the validation set (HRâ€‰=â€‰2.92; P < 0.001). The model combining the radiomic signature and clinicoradiologic findings had the best performance (C indexâ€‰=â€‰0.788, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72-0.86; integrated time-dependent area under the curve of 0.837 at 3 years).


DATA CONCLUSION
The novel radiomic signature could be used to predict DFS in patients with LARC. Furthermore, combining this radiomic signature with clinicoradiologic features significantly improved the ability to estimate DFS (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.001, 0.005 in training set and in validation set, respectively), and may help guide individualized treatment in such patients.

"Karakteristik Morfologi Lamun Thalassodendron ciliatum (Forsskall) Hartog 1970 (Kelas: Magnoliopsida,Famili : Cymodoceaceae) Berdasarkan Tipe Substrat di Perairan Pantai Timur Kabupaten Bulukumba","This study aims to determine the seagrass morphological characteristic based on substrates and analyze the relationship of environmental factors with the morphology of Thalassodendron ciliatum. A sampling at each station was done purposively according to the substrate. Sampling was carried out in 3 areas as replication by digging and taking seagrass complete with rhizome and its roots as many as 25 stands. Then the seagrass was cleaned from the sand and put into a sample bag and stored in a cooler. At the same time, sand and water samples were also taken to measure the nitrate and phosphate. The measured water quality in situ includes current speed, temperature, salinity, depth, and wave height. In the laboratory, measurements of morphological parameters of seagrass were done on the leaves, stems, rhizomes, and roots. The results showed that the sandy substrate (Kasuso Station: more protected) showed a longer and thicker leaf character, and a longer root with a greater number of roots, but had a number of leaves, rhizoma length, internode distance, and root diameter smaller than the area with the substrate was dominated by coral fragments (Panrangluhu Station). Under weak current conditions with high nitrate and phosphate content, they were characterized by the larger stem and leaf lengths with a large number of roots. Whereas in strong currents, seagrass was characterized by a greater number and area of leaves and root diameter. Areas with high waves, characterized by seagrasses that have larger stem diameters, longer rhizomes with larger diameters, and also longer internode distances Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mendeterminasi karakter morfologi lamun berdasarkan tipe substrat dan menganalisis keterkaitan faktor lingkungan dengan morfologi lamun Thalassodendron ciliatum. Sampling pada setiap stasiun dilakukan secara purposif dengan memperhatikan susbstrat dasar.Â  Sampling dilakukan pada 3 area sebagai ulangan denganÂ  cara menggali dan mengambil lamun lengkap dengan rhizoma dan akarnya sebanyak 25 tegakan. Kemudian lamun dibersihkan dari pasir dan dimasukkan ke dalam kantong sampel yang berisi air laut dan disimpan dalam kotak pendingin.Â  Bersamaan dengan itu, juga diambil sampel pasir dan air untuk diukur kandungan nitrat dan posfatnya.Â  Kualitas air yang diukur secara insitu meliputi kecepatan arus, suhu, salinitas, kedalaman, dan tinggi gelombang.Â  Di laboratorium diukur parameter morfologi lamun pada bagian daun, batang, rhizoma, dan akar.Â  Hasil analisis menunjukkan bahwa pada substrat berpasir (Stasiun Kasuso: lebih terlindung) memperlihatkan karakter daun yang lebih panjang dan tebal, serta akar yang lebih panjang dengan jumlah akar yang lebih banyak, namun memiliki jumlah daun, panjang rhizoma, jarak internode, dan diameter akar yang lebih kecil dibandingkan dengan daerah yang substratnya didominasi oleh pecahan karang (Stasiun Panrangluhu). Pada kondisi arus yang lemah dengan kandungan nitrat dan posfat yang tinggi, dicirikan oleh panjang batang dan daun yang lebih besar dengan jumlah akar yang banyak. Sedangkan pada arus yang kuat, lamun dicirikan oleh jumlah dan luasan daun serta diameter akar yang lebih besar.Â  Daerah dengan gelombang yang tinggi, dicirikan oleh lamun yang memiliki diameter batang yang lebih besar, rhizoma yang lebih panjang dengan diameter yang besar, dan jarak internode yang juga lebih panjang.",2020,
"Hydrophilous pollination of a dioecious seagrass, Thalassodendron ciliatum (Cymodoceaceae) in Kenya","The flowering of the dioecious seagrass Thalassodendron ciliatum (Cymodoceaceae) in Kenya is coincident with extremely low spring tides. Staminate plants release their flowers underwater immediately before the low tide begins to return. These float to the surface and there they expel the filamentous pollen. The pollen form floating snowflakelike rafts (search vehicles) that collide on the water surface with the female stigmas. Since pollination occurs on the water surface, T. ciliatum has a category 2 hydrophilous pollination system, strikingly similar to that of Amphibolis. Seeds of the developing fruit germinate precociously and seedling development is viviparous.",1991,Biotropica
Increased Regulatory T-Cell Activity and Enhanced T-Cell Homeostatic Signaling in Slow Progressing HIV-infected Children,"Pediatric slow progressors (PSP) are rare ART-naÃ¯ve, HIV-infected children who maintain high CD4 T-cell counts and low immune activation despite persistently high viral loads. Using a well-defined cohort of PSP, we investigated the role of regulatory T-cells (TREG) and of IL-7 homeostatic signaling in maintaining normal-for-age CD4 counts in these individuals. Compared to children with progressive disease, PSP had greater absolute numbers of TREG, skewed toward functionally suppressive phenotypes. As with immune activation, overall T-cell proliferation was lower in PSP, but was uniquely higher in central memory TREG (CM TREG), indicating active engagement of this subset. Furthermore, PSP secreted higher levels of the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10 than children who progressed. The frequency of suppressive TREG, CM TREG proliferation, and IL-10 production were all lower in PSP who go on to progress at a later time-point, supporting the importance of an active TREG response in preventing disease progression. In addition, we find that IL-7 homeostatic signaling is enhanced in PSP, both through preserved surface IL-7receptor (CD127) expression on central memory T-cells and increased plasma levels of soluble IL-7receptor, which enhances the bioactivity of IL-7. Combined analysis, using a LASSO modeling approach, indicates that both TREG activity and homeostatic T-cell signaling make independent contributions to the preservation of CD4 T-cells in HIV-infected children. Together, these data demonstrate that maintenance of normal-for-age CD4 counts in PSP is an active process, which requires both suppression of immune activation through functional TREG, and enhanced T-cell homeostatic signaling.",2019,Frontiers in Immunology

Forecasting Electricity Spot Prices Using Lasso: On Capturing the Autoregressive Intraday Structure,"In this paper we present a regression based model for day-ahead electricity spot prices. We estimate the considered linear regression model by the lasso estimation method. The lasso approach allows for many possible parameters in the model, but also shrinks and sparsifies the parameters automatically to avoid overfitting. Thus, it is able to capture the autoregressive intraday dependency structure of the electricity price well. We discuss in detail the estimation results which provide insights to the intraday behavior of electricity prices. We perform an out-of-sample forecasting study for several European electricity markets. The results illustrate well that the efficient lasso based estimation technique can exhibit advantages from two popular model approaches.",2016,IEEE Transactions on Power Systems
