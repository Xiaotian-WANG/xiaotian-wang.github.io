Die Umschichtung im polyphonen Denken,"Angesichts der Tatsache, dass Wort und Ausdruck im Zentrum von Lassoâ€™s musikalischem Denken stehen, steigt die Frage auf: Warum brach Lasso nicht mit den traditionellen Mitteln musikalischer Gestaltung? Warum gab er nicht die niederlandische Polyphonie auf? Warum schuf er nicht den monodischen Stil, wenn es ihm doch nur auf Ausdruck ankam ? Lag das wirklich daran, dass die â€ž technische Entwicklungâ€œ noch nicht soweit gediehen, dass die â€žZeit dafur noch nicht reif warâ€œ? Diese Anschauung steht doch wohl hinter der mehrfach geausserten Meinung: Lasso ware â€” eine Generation spater geboren â€” ein beruhmter Opernkomponist geworden.",1937,
Multiple Equivalent Solutions for the Lasso.,"Feature selection is an important problem studied in data analytics seeking to identify a minimal-size feature subset that is optimally predictive for an outcome of interest. It is also a powerful tool in Knowledge Discovery as a means for gaining domain insight, e.g., identifying which medical quantities carry unique information for the disease status. It is arguably less recognized however, that the problem may have multiple, equivalent solutions. In that case, it is misleading to domain experts to report only one of them and ignore all other equivalent solutions. In this paper, we extend a well-established single, feature selection algorithm (i.e., reporting a single solution), namely the Lasso algorithm, to the multiple solution problem based on formalized notion of equivalence for both classification and regression tasks. Empirical results are obtained using a fully automated pipeline called Just Add Data Bio or JAD Bio training and selecting multiple, linear as well as nonlinear learners, optimizing hyper-parameter values, and correcting for the bias of multiple inductions (model selection). The results show that multiple solutions do exist in real datasets, as well as the ability of the algorithm to identify a subset of them. A comparison with the Statistical Equivalent Solutions (SES) algorithm shows that Lasso equivalent solutions have better prediction performance at the cost of selecting more features.",2017,arXiv: Statistics Theory

DualitÃ©s de forme de pratique fÃ©minine de ski et de consommation de matÃ©riel de glisse,"Lâ€™objectif de cet article est dâ€™ameliorer la connaissance de la pratiquante de ski alpin et de ses logiques de consommation de materiel de glisse. Quelques questions simples peuvent schematiser notre reflexionÂ : Qui est la pratiquante de skiÂ ? Que fait-elle sur les planchesÂ ? Comment achete-t-elle son materiel de glisseÂ ? Sa consommation est-elle influencee par sa position sociale et sa modalite de pratiqueÂ ? Ces questions seront etudiees dans le cadre des theories sociologiques des pratiques sportives et de la consommation. La methodologie repose sur un sondage (n=318) par questionnaire en station de sports dâ€™hiver. On repere deux dimensions-profils de pratiquantesÂ : lâ€™une majoritaire, que nous avons qualifiee de Â«Â jouisseuseÂ Â», a la recherche de convivialite, de detente et de contemplation, lâ€™autre minoritaire, que nous avons appelee Â«Â performeuseÂ Â» et dont la pratique repond a une depense dâ€™energie, une prise de risque et un souci technique. Paradoxalement, câ€™est ce second profil que visent prioritairement les marques dans leur communication. En ce qui concerne le materiel de glisse, la segmentation du marche entre location (70%) et achat (30%) conduit a des criteres de choix communs dâ€™abord centres sur une technologie adaptee aux femmes, facile a skier, legere, mais qui se differencient en demandant un rapport qualite/prix avantageux chez les acheteuses alors que les loueuses avouent aussi un Â«Â choix par defautÂ Â». Ce dernier renvoie au role essentiel du conseilleur loueur ou vendeur et aux repercussions manageriales que cela implique. Les criteres esthetiques souvent evoques pour la consommation feminine ne sont pas mis en avant ici. La segmentation acheteuse versus loueuse est operee par la technique statistique innovante de la regression logistique avec lasso qui releve dâ€™abord des elements spatiaux et temporels de la sociodemographie et des formes de pratiques et, secondairement, motivationnels. Enfin, les deux profils de pratiquantes seront relies a leurs formes de pratique et modes de consommation.",2012,Management & Avenir
"Paper 1 ( Work in progress ) Adolescents sexual behavior and risk of HIV in Bobo-Dioulasso , Burkina Faso","Based on the sentinel sites information, the HIV rate was estimated to 7.2% for Burkina Faso at the end of 1997. In order to have thinner data, useful for designing local interventions, a representative cross-sectional survey was conducted in Bobo-Dioulasso in year 2000. Behavioural and biological information were collected on 2400 people aged between 13 and 49. The current study is related to the sub-sample of adolescent people (13-19 years). It first analyses the sero-status and then, some sexual behaviours considered in the literature as risky in regard of HIV infection. The results show that six adolescents (5 girls and 1 boy) are infected by HIV. It is however surprising to notice that five of the six infected adolescents (the boy and 4 of the 5 girls) say they never had sex. If their statements were true, it would require to look for ways of HIV transmission in BoboDioulasso, other than sex, for more appropriate strategies to fight against the disease. The analysis of the adolescentsâ€™ sexual behaviours (sexually active adolescents) show however risky behaviours regarding HIV infection and therefore, early interventions towards this category of the population are needed.",2003,
Statistical process adjustment of multivariate processes with minimum control efforts,"In controlling a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) process, usually all control variables have to be adjusted at each step, which may incur high adjustment cost. This paper proposes a Lasso adjustment algorithm, which minimizes the number of variables to be adjusted at each step. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can maintain acceptable output deviations while reduce the number of variables need to be adjusted significant.",2010,2010 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management

Sparse Additive Interaction Learning,"A conceptual paradigm for onset of a new disease is often considered to be the result of changes in entire biological networks whose states are affected by a complex interaction of genetic and environmental factors. However, when modelling a relevant phenotype as a function of high dimensional measurements, power to estimate interactions is low, the number of possible interactions could be enormous and their effects may be non-linear. Existing approaches for high dimensional modelling such as the lasso might keep an interaction but remove a main effect, which is problematic for interpretation. In this work, we introduce a method called sail for detecting non-linear interactions with a key environmental or exposure variable in high-dimensional settings which respects either the strong or weak heredity constraints. We prove that asymptotically, our method possesses the oracle property, i.e., it performs as well as if the true model were known in advance. We develop a computationally efficient fitting algorithm with automatic tuning parameter selection, which scales to high-dimensional datasets. Through an extensive simulation study, we show that sail outperforms existing penalized regression methods in terms of prediction accuracy and support recovery when there are non-linear interactions with an exposure variable. We then apply sail to detect non-linear interactions between genes and a prenatal psychosocial intervention program on cognitive performance in children at 4 years of age. Results from our method show that individuals who are genetically predisposed to lower educational attainment are those who stand to benefit the most from the intervention. Our algorithms are implemented in an R package available on CRAN https://cran.r-project.org/package=sail.",2018,bioRxiv

Gli studi di politica,"Non sempre e facile rintracciare una linea unitaria, sia culturale, sia editoriale, in una rivista di Â« politica Â» che vive da cinquantanni . Il caso de Â« Il Politico Â» e tuttavia una felice eccezione che appare ancor piu emblematico se si considera la personalita del suo fondatore, il fatto che essa e edita, quasi voce ufficiale, da una Facolta, quella di Pavia, gloriosa ma aperta alle novita, e soprattutto se si considerano i profondi mutamenti registratisi, in questo lasso di tempo, nel campo di quella che oggi viene chiamata Â« filosofia delle scienze sociali Â». Eppure, uno sguardo retrospettivo mostra come Â« Il Politico Â» abbia mantenuto una linea costante e fedele ad un progetto iniziale decisamente originale. Soprattutto se lo si confronta con quelle che erano allora le poche riviste che in Italia si occupavano di Â« politica Â». Tale progetto venne enunciato con chiarezza da Bruno Leoni nel primo numero, e il fatto che si sia potuto mantenere nei decenni successivi costituisce prova della lungimiranza e della larghezza d'orizzonti del suo fondatore e di quello che fin dagli inizi fu l'artefice materiale della rivista e poi il suo valido direttore. Leoni voleva fare una rivista in cui l'analisi scientifica dei problemi politici non fosse disgiunta da finalita pratiche. Credeva che tali problemi dovessero essere indagati Â« al di fuori e al di sopra degli interessi, delle pregiudiziali e dei dogmi dei cosiddetti ""partiti politici"" Â», perche era convinto che anche per la loro analisi il rapporto tra fini e mezzi fosse fondamentale. L'esempio di tale approccio alla politica egli lo individuo nell'economia. Scrisse, in quella circostanza, che Â« l'economia e scienza politica Â», senza pero nascondersi che Â« l'economia non copre tutto il campo d'indagine proprio della scienza politica. Esistono fini e mezzi di natura concettuale, che l'economista non sottopone alle sue analisi.

Cio che gli stava a cuore era quindi il Â« rapporto di compatibilita, o di incompatibilita tra fini di diversa natura concettuale Â» e tra questi e l'idoneita o l'inidoneita dei mezzi: Â« fra mezzi concettuali disponibili e i fini concettuali perseguiti Â».

The Analystâ€™s Act of Freedom as Agent of Therapeutic Change,"In this paper I intend to explore a phenomenon with which all analysts are familiar. I will first describe it and then examine what its implications are for theory. I shall refer to it as the 'x-phenomenon'. I shall start with some clinical examples. I was charging Miss M a little more than half what my other patients were paying. She had been a clinic patient and I used to sigh to myself and say inwardly, 'Poor Miss M, Â£X is the most that I can charge her'. I did not in fact articulate it so clearly as that. In my mind it was like an acknowledged fact that everyone knows, like the unreliability of the English weather. It was part of the furniture of my mind and I had resigned myself to it in the same way as I reluctantly resign myself to the English weather. So the analysis went on and on with that assumption as its unquestioned concomitant until one day a startling thought occurred to me: 'Why can't Miss M pay the same as all my other patients?' Then I remembered the resentment she frequently expressed towards her boss who always called her 'Little Mary'. A certainty began to grow in me that I was the prisoner of an illusion about the patient's capacities. I had been lassoed into the patient's self-perception and I was just beginning to extricate myself from it. I then brought up the question of her fee and in the course of a discussion she said, 'If I had to pay more then I know I would'. She had now clearly told me that she had the capacity in her to pay more and that this could be mobilized if I changed my inner attitude towards her. A few sessions later I said to her, 'I have been thinking over our discussion about the fee. I charge most of my other patients Â£X and in our discussion I have not heard anything that makes me think that I should not charge you the same'. For two sessions she cried rather pitifully but then became resolved that she would meet the challenge. Soon she found a job that paid her one third more than her previous salary. In moving job she extricated herself from the patronizing tutelage of the boss who called her 'Little Mary'. She had been able to do this because she had first been freed from the patronizing attitude of her analyst. Shortly after this she finally gave the push to a parasitic boyfriend. Again I think she had been able to do this because she had been able to give the push to a parasitic analyst. These two events were soon followed by other favourable developments. I think the source of these beneficial changes was in that moment of inner freedom when I had the unexpected thought: 'Why can't Miss M pay the same as my other patients?' I am calling this act of inner freedom the 'x-phenomenon'. Now I want to take another example. This patient was an obsessional man who used to hesitate sometimes in the middle of telling me something, usually as he was about to tell me some thought he had had since the previous session. As he had often expressed his apprehension that I would think him pathetic I would say to him something like, 'I think you are afraid that if you tell me about the incident in your mind I shall think you are pathetic'. Of course I was thereby clearly inferring that I would not think him pathetic. With this assurance he would then obligingly tell me the thought in his mind. Then one day I was reading the following passage from 'Four Discussions with W. R. Biori:",2017,
The Relation Water Structures Have with Culture and Architecture: ACase Study from Sagalassos,"Lorem throughout history human settlements have been shaped by water to a great extent. Besides being a source of sustenance, humans have needed water for several other needs including transportation and recreation. It is a known fact that past civilizations have built their cities and villages near rivers, streams, lakes or other water sources throughout the historical process. Even in modern cities, water remains an important factor in the design of open spaces and for the quality of human life. For designers, water is one of the most attractive and entrancing design elements in the design and organization of urban open spaces. Sometimes water is used as an element of aesthetics, sometimes to cool the air, supress noise, irrigate or for recreation. Over time, humans have developed several water structures like canals, fountains and ponds in an attempt to benefit from the aesthetic, psychological and vital qualities of water. In particular, street fountains situated in town centers were also a place for locals to socialize. The shapes and decorations on fountains essentially reflect social culture. This study will first briefly mention the place of water in the mythology and cosmology of different cultures before looking at the development of water structures in Anatolian culture during the Ancient and Byzantine periods with a special focus on fountains (in streets and squares). The ancient city of Sagalassos was the capital of Psiydia and was built on terraces on the SW hills of Akdag and this study will culturally and architecturally examine the monumental fountain in this settlement that was built between AD 161-180, during the reign of Marcus Aurelius to signify the prestige of the Roman Empire.",2016,Arts and social sciences journal
Genome-wide screening diagnostic biomarkers and the construction of prognostic model of hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Although methods in diagnosis and therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have made significant progress in decades, the overall survival (OS) of HCC remains dissatisfactory, so it is particularly important to find better diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. In this study, we found a more reliable potential diagnostic biomarkers and constructed a more accurate prognostic evaluation model based on integrated transcriptome sequencing analysis of multiple independent data sets. First, we performed quality evaluation and differential analysis on seven Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data sets, and then comprehensively analyzed the differentially expressed genes with a robust rank aggregation algorithm. Next,Â Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was used to establish an 8-gene prognostic risk score (RS) model. Finally, the prognostic model was further validated in the GEO data set. Also, RS has independence on other clinicopathological characteristics but has similarities in prognostic assessment compared with the T stage. Moreover, the combination of T stage and prognostic RS model based on the 8-gene had a better prognostic evaluation effect. In brief, our research suggest that the prognostic risk model of 8 genes has important clinical significance in HCC patients, and can further enrich the prognostic guidance value of the traditional T stage.",2019,Journal of cellular biochemistry
De-Biasing The Lasso With Degrees-of-Freedom Adjustment,"This paper studies schemes to de-bias the Lasso in sparse linear regression where the goal is to estimate and construct confidence intervals for a low-dimensional projection of the unknown coefficient vector in a preconceived direction $a_0$. We assume that the design matrix has iid Gaussian rows with known covariance matrix $\Sigma$. Our analysis reveals that previous propositions to de-bias the Lasso require a modification in order to enjoy asymptotic efficiency in a full range of the level of sparsity. This modification takes the form of a degrees-of-freedom adjustment that accounts for the dimension of the model selected by the Lasso. 
Let $s_0$ denote the number of nonzero coefficients of the true coefficient vector. The unadjusted de-biasing schemes proposed in previous studies enjoys efficiency if $s_0\lll n^{2/3}$, up to logarithmic factors. However, if $s_0\ggg n^{2/3}$, the unadjusted scheme cannot be efficient in certain directions $a_0$. In the latter regime, it it necessary to modify existing procedures by an adjustment that accounts for the degrees-of-freedom of the Lasso. The proposed degrees-of-freedom adjustment grants asymptotic efficiency for any direction $a_0$. This holds under a Sparse Riecz Condition on the covariance matrix $\Sigma$ and the sample size requirement $s_0/p\to0$ and $s_0\log(p/s_0)/n\to0$. 
Our analysis also highlights that the degrees-of-freedom adjustment is not necessary when the initial bias of the Lasso in the direction $a_0$ is small, which is granted under more stringent conditions on $\Sigma^{-1}$. This explains why the necessity of degrees-of-freedom adjustment did not appear in some previous studies. 
The main proof argument involves a Gaussian interpolation path similar to that used to derive Slepian's lemma. It yields a sharp $\ell_\infty$ error bound for the Lasso under Gaussian design which is of independent interest.",2019,arXiv: Statistics Theory

MultiDimensional Sparse Super-Resolution,"This paper studies sparse super-resolution in arbitrary dimensions. More precisely, it develops a theoretical analysis of support recovery for the so-called BLASSO method, which is an off-the-grid generalisation of l1 regularization (also known as the LASSO). While super-resolution is of paramount importance in overcoming the limitations of many imaging devices, its theoretical analysis is still lacking beyond the 1-dimensional (1-D) case. The reason is that in the 2-dimensional (2-D) case and beyond, the relative position of the spikes enters the picture, and different geometrical configurations lead to different stability properties. Our first main contribution is a connection, in the limit where the spikes cluster at a given point, between solutions of the dual of the BLASSO problem and Hermite polynomial interpolation ideals. Polynomial bases for these ideals, introduced by De Boor, can be computed by Gaussian elimination, and lead to an algorithmic description of limiting solutions to the dual problem. With this construction at hand, our second main contribution is a detailed analysis of the support stability and super-resolution effect in the case of a pair of spikes. This includes in particular a sharp analysis of how the signal-to-noise ratio should scale with respect to the separation distance between the spikes. Lastly, numerical simulations on different classes of kernels show the applicability of this theory and highlight the richness of super-resolution in 2-D.",2019,SIAM J. Math. Analysis
The Indian Ocean Coast of Somalia,"Abstract Somalia has the longest national coastline (3025 km) in Africa with an estimated shelf area (depth 0â€“200 m) of 32Â 500 km2. The country is divided into the northern coastal plain of Guban, which has a semi-arid terrain; the northern highlands with rugged mountain ranges containing the countryâ€™s highest peak (2407 m); and the Ogaden region which descends to the south from the highlands and which consists of shallow plateau valleys, wadis and broken mountains. The latter region continues to the Mudug plain in central Somalia. From Ras Caseyr to the Kenya border, the coast runs north-east to south-west, coinciding with the displacement caused by the Mesozoic marginal subsidence. This general structure is complicated by sedimentary troughs crossing the Horn of Africa, and by large sedimentary basins, cutting the coastline and extending inland into Southern Somalia and Northern Kenya (Jubaâ€“Lamu embayment, Mogadishu basin). Offshore, the western Somali Basin extends from Socotra to the Comores. The open shelf environments developed along the Somali coast are a consequence of an extensive marine transgression, connected to coastal subsidence or inland uplift. The rocks along the southern coastal belt are Plioceneâ€“Pleistocene, and are characterized by a sequence of both marine and continental deposits of skeletal sands, coral build-ups, eolian sands and paleosols. As well as eolian and biogenic sedimentary processes, sea-level fluctuations, Holocene climatic changes and neotectonic movements have combined to produce the modern coastline. A notable feature is an ancient dune ridge complex, known as the Merka red dune, which rims the coast extending beyond the Kenyan border and which separates the narrow coastal belt from the Uebi Shebeli alluvial plain. Two features of note are the Bajuni Archipelago, which consists of islands, islets and skerries, forming a barrier island separated from the coast by a narrow marine sound, and a braided, channelized coastal area, which originated from the drowning of a paleofluvial net. The southern Somali coast, with that of Kenya and Tanzania, forms part of the Somali Current Large Marine Ecosystem, encompassing 700Â 000 km2, and extending 800 km between Dar es Salaam and Ras Hafun. Abundant biomass develops here due to upwelling. The shelf area has a wide variety of coral reefs, mangroves, seagrass meadows, beaches and estuaries. In shallow water areas the abraded flats are colonized by scattered coral communities with variable cover. A true fringing reef is achieved in places only in the Bajuni archipelago. All along the southern Somali coastal shelf there are spreading meadows of Thalassodendron seagrass, and benthic communities typical of mobile sandy substrates are limited to beach ridges and shoals developed along the coastline. Around the Bajuni barrier island and the channelized area there is more diversity. Mangroves grow on the tidal belts of the channels, and there are expanses of salt flats. Large-scale alteration produced by man on the Somali coast is relatively recent, but has accelerated in the last few decades, especially around major cities. This alteration affects especially backshore areas where the Pleistocene coral reefs are quarried. At present, the continental shelf is not adequately monitored or protected, so coastal habitats are being degraded, living marine resources are overexploited, and pollution levels are increasing, all of which affect natural resources and biodiversity. Somalia is one of the worldâ€™s poorest and least developed countries, with few resources and devastated by civil war, but since 1993 it has been part of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA). This will affect fisheries and aquaculture in terms of the investment, production, trade and fish consumption of the member states. There are currently no marine protected areas and no legislation concerning their establishment and management, although the World Conservation Monitoring Centre (WCMC) Protected Areas Database lists Busc Busc Game Reserve as an MPA. In 1992, The WCMC also listed the following coastal sites as proposed protected areas: Zeila (important sea bird colonies on offshore islets), Jowharâ€“Warshek, Awdhegleâ€“Gandershe. The area from Kisimayo to Ras Chiambone is probably of highest priority, as it is important for coral reefs, marine turtles, and mangrove resources, although it is still poorly known.",2000,Marine Pollution Bulletin
Lâ€™Italia e il sistema internazionale (PDF),"Lâ€™Italia e il sistema internazionale. Dalla formazione del governo Mussolini alla Grande Depressione, in due volumi, ricostruisce la politica estera della prima fase del fascismo, affrontando l'intero complesso dei problemi che ineriscono all'azione internazionale dell'Italia fin dalla sua partecipazione alla prima guerra mondiale: struttura e gestione del Ministero degli Esteri, questioni territoriali e coloniali, problemi finanziari e monetari. Sulla base della documentazione e dei dati economici esistenti, lo studio intende rispondere criticamente non solo agli interrogativi di fondo che ha posto la politica estera fascista, quali la continuita o discontinuita con quella dei governi liberali o le specificita strutturali e di metodo della diplomazia mussoliniana, ma - soprattutto - interrogarsi sugli obiettivi di fondo di una politica posta di fronte allâ€™alternativa fra inserire l'Italia nel sistema internazionale a direzione anglo-franco-statunitense o puntare, al contrario, alla sua trasformazione e infine al suo rovesciamento.

Predicting the tumor response to chemoradiotherapy for rectal cancer: Model development and external validation using MRI radiomics.,"BACKGROUND
In well-responding patients to chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC), a watch-and-wait strategy can be considered. To implement organ-sparing strategies, accurate patient selection is needed. We investigate the use of MRI-based radiomics models to predict tumor response to improve patient selection.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Models were developed in a cohort of 70 patients and validated in an external cohort of 55 patients. Patients received chemoradiation followed by surgery and underwent T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) before and after chemoradiation. The outcome measure was (near-)complete pathological tumor response (ypT0-1N0). Tumor segmentation was done on T2-images and transferred to b800-images and ADC maps, after which quantitative and four semantic features were extracted. We combined features using principal component analysis and built models using LASSO regression analysis. The best models based on precision and performance were selected for validation.


RESULTS
21/70 patients (30%) achieved ypT0-1N0 in the development cohort versus 13/55 patients (24%) in the validation cohort. Three models (t2_dwi_pre_post, semantic_dwi_adc_pre, semantic_dwi_post) were identified with an area-under-the-curve (AUC) of 0.83 (95% CI 0.70-0.95), 0.86 (95% CI 0.75-0.98) and 0.84 (95% CI 0.75-0.94) respectively. Two models (t2_dwi_pre_post, semantic_dwi_post) validated well in the external cohort with AUCs of 0.83 (95% CI 0.70-0.95) and 0.86 (95% CI 0.76-0.97). These models however did not outperform a previously established four-feature semantic model.


CONCLUSION
Prediction models based on MRI radiomics non-invasively predict tumor response after chemoradiation for rectal cancer and can be used as an additional tool to identify patients eligible for an organ-preserving treatment.",2019,Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology
Experimental study of atrial fibrillation cycle length during rapid atrial septal pacing,"Computer model-based simulations have shown that rapid stimulation at 60â€“100% of atrial fibrillation cycle length (AFCL) from a ring of electrodes located around the septum may induce local capture in both atria for most AF dynamics. The present study aims to investigate whether model-based results on AF septal pacing can be translated to experimental simulations. Acute experiments on swine hearts were performed in vivo. The septal ring of electrodes was experimentally implemented using a decapolar lasso catheter placed against the septal wall. Rapid septal pacing was applied in sequences of 10-sec simultaneously on four electrodes on the septal ring. The extent of local AF capture, defined as the ability of the rapid pacing sequence to take control over certain areas of the atria, was assessed via two decapolar mapping catheters in the right and left atrium. AFCL was measured on bipolar electrograms using a nonlinear filtering technique that uses short- and long-term electrogram energies for a robust CL extraction. AFCL was significantly higher in the right atrium compared to the AFCL in left atrium which indicates the existence of different AF dynamics in the two atria. Local capture was observed in both atria when pacing from four electrodes on the septum.",2017,2017 Computing in Cardiology (CinC)
"New Information on the Osteology and A Taxonomic Revision of the Genus Thalassodromeus (Pterodactyloidea, Tapejaridae, Thalassodrominae)","ABSTRACT Thalassodromeus sethi (Pterodactyloidea, Tapejaridae, Thalassodrominae) is a unique pterosaur from the Romualdo Formation, Araripe Basin (Early Cretaceous, Albian). A large sagittal cranial crest (the largest known ossified crest of any pterosaur) and unusual toothless bladed jaws constitute some of its outstanding anatomical features. Its holotype (DGM 1476-R, almost complete skull and mandible in three dimensions) represents one of the largest pterosaur skulls ever found. Here, we provide a detailed osteological redescription of the holotype, which has only been preliminarily described. We also describe and depict for the first time some skeletal regions of Th. sethi, including the occiput, the palatal openings, and a dentary fragment. Finally, in the light of new information concerning this species, we revisited the specimen NMSG SAO 251093 (an incomplete mandible), also from the Romualdo Formation and originally referred to Th. sethi but recently redescribed as a new species of dsungaripterid pterosaur named Banguela oberlii. Here, the analysis of a cast (MN 4703-V) and its inclusion in a phylogenetic analysis recovered NMSG SAO 251093 within the Thalassodrominae, as a sister taxon of Th. sethi and indeed different from it at the species level. We hereby rename it Thalassodromeus oberlii, comb. nov. These considerations provide new data for discussions concerning the morphology of the Tapejaridae, the diversity of the Araripe pterosaur fauna, and the complex evolution of the pterodactyloid palatal region, as well as data for future morphofunctional studies of Thalassodromeus.",2018,Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology

"A Tribute from Johannes Eccard to Orlando di Lasso at Concordia Seminary, St. Louis","A few years ago the library of Concordia Seminary, St. Louis, Missouri, obtained an unusual copy of the 1590 second edition of Icones sire Imagines virorum literis illustrium by Nicolaus Reusner (1545-1602). (1) It contains many blank leaves bound in and several tipped in among the biographical sketches in leones. The tipped-in leaves include handwritten pages by Martin Luther and Philipp Melanchthon. The bound-in blank leaves contain some two hundred inscriptions and signatures related to the nearby biographical subjects. Among the latter is a handwritten tribute from Johannes Eccard to Orlando di Lasso, dated 1593 (fig. 1). How this copy of Icones came to include Eccard's tribute, along with those of so many of his contemporaries, and how the book found its way over the centuries from Europe to St. Louis would make a fascinating story, if only more details were known. Nevertheless, the story of Icones and its dependence on other early printed books is no less interesting, and it is the logical starting point for an examination of Concordia's copy of the book. [FIGURE 1 OMITTED] Icones is a collection of portraits of noted theologians, historians, poets, jurists, and other learned persons, most of whom lived during the sixteenth century in German-speaking realms. The first edition of Icones was issued in 1587 by the same publisher as in 1590, Bernhard Jobin, with the same tide, followed in a few months by an edition with German rather than Latin text. (2) A facsimile of the first edition was published in 1973. (3) Most of the portraits have brief biographies appended, and many of them are also followed by several poems in praise of their subjects. The selection of subjects is heavily weighted towards reformers of the church, including Martin Luther himself. The only musician to have an entry in the collection is Orlando di Lasso, whose music was highly esteemed by the evangelical church, though his own sympathies undoubtedly lay with the Counter-Reformation. (4) The idea of issuing a collection of portraits of famous men was not new when Icones was first published. According to Manfred Lemmer, an important model for their enterprise was provided in Basel by Peter Perna, (5) who in 1571 began to issue a series of Elogia (inscriptions or epitaphs) of famous men that had been collected in Como by Paolo Giovio (1483-1552), a courtier and historian who eventually became bishop of Nocera. Giovio's inscriptions were in effect a descriptive catalog of a gallery of portraits he had assembled that became famous far and wide. Perna published copies of many of these portraits in three volumes, based on Giovio's collection; these volumes included copies of the portraits and also short biographies (the Elogia) of the illustrious warriors, men of letters, and other notables they portrayed. The portraits were printed from woodcuts made by the illustrator and portrait painter Tobias Stimmer (1539-1584), who had been sent by Perna to Como for the purpose of copying the portraits in Giovio's collection. Among Stimmer's many publications after Perna's collections are the portraits in Reusner's Icones. Perna's Elogia contained few entries for individuals from German realms, which was also true of similar collections that were published soon afterwards. Reusner's Icones filled that gap. Collections of portraits might be considered a subgenre within the larger category of collections of biographies, which has its roots in classical antiquity with writers such as Plutarch and Suetonius. In connection with Lasso, one such sixteenth-century collection is of special interest, Heinricus Pantaleon's Prosopographiae. (6) Among the political figures and learned men whose biographies appear there, Lasso is the only musician, indeed the only representative of the fine arts in general. (7) Since this is also true of Reusner's Icones, one may reasonably ask if there is any connection between the two books. One connection may be the biography itself. â€¦",2004,Notes
A warning thresholds scheme with dynamic oil parameters based on lasso regression and 6sigma,"Dynamic early warning makes great sense for oil management to keep safety and stability of oil production. In this paper, we derive the production regression model, predict production with 10 oil parameters based on Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Lasso) and Least Angle Regression (LARS) methods. The 10 most relevant oil parameters are decided by the warning parameters selection method from kinds of different parameters, which makes the prediction more reliable. The accuracy of regression model achieves 97%. Then we get the warning thresholds based on 6Ïƒ. Oil parameters for warning threshold partition experiment are from the database of Tianjin oilfield. The experiment results show that our method is capable of warning both mild and severe situation, and the accuracy is 95%, which runs ahead in oil industry and has great popularization value.",2016,2016 IEEE International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)

Robust Flexible Feature Selection via Exclusive L21 Regularization,"Recently, exclusive lasso has demonstrated its promising results in selecting discriminative features for each class. The sparsity is enforced on each feature across all the classes via `1,2-norm. However, the exclusive sparsity of `1,2-norm could not screen out a large amount of irrelevant and redundant noise features in high-dimensional data space, since each feature belongs to at least one class. Thus, in this paper, we introduce a novel regularization called â€œexclusive `2,1â€, which is short for â€œ`2,1 with exclusive lassoâ€, towards robust flexible feature selection. The exclusive `2,1 regularization is the mix of `2,1-norm and `1,2-norm, which brings out joint sparsity at inter-group level and exclusive sparsity at intra-group level simultaneously. An efficient augmented Lagrange multipliers based optimization algorithm is proposed to iteratively solve the exclusive `2,1 regularization in a row-wise fashion. Extensive experiments on twelve benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed regularization and the optimization algorithm as compared to state-of-the-arts.",2019,
Fast Screening Technology for Drug Emergency Management: Predicting Suspicious SNPs for ADR with Information Theory-based Models.,"OBJECTIVE
The genetic polymorphism of Cytochrome P450 (CYP 450) is considered as one of the main causes for adverse drug reactions (ADRs). In order to explore the latent correlations between ADRs and potentially corresponding single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) in CYP450, three algorithms based on information theory are used as the main method to predict the possible relation.


METHODS
The study uses a retrospective case-control study to explore the potential relation of ADRs to specific genomic locations and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). The genomic data collected from 53 healthy volunteers are applied for the analysis, another group of genomic data collected from 30 healthy volunteers excluded from the study are used as the control group. The SNPs respective on five loci of CYP2D6*2,*10,*14 and CYP1A2*1C, *1F are detected by the Applied Biosystem 3130xl. The raw data is processed by ChromasPro to detect the specific alleles on the above loci from each sample. The secondary data are reorganized and processed by R combined with the reports of ADRs from clinical reports. Three information theory based algorithms are implemented for the screening task: JMI, CMIM, and mRMR. If a SNP is selected by more than two algorithms, we are confident to conclude that it is related to the corresponding ADR. The selection results are compared with the control decision tree + LASSO regression model.


RESULTS
In the study group where ADRs occur, 10 SNPs are considered relevant to the occurrence of a specific ADR by the combined information theory model. In comparison, only 5 SNPs are considered relevant to a specific ADR by the decision tree + LASSO regression model. In addition, the new method detects more relevant pairs of SNP and ADR which are affected by both SNP and dosage. This implies that the new information theory based model is effective to discover correlations of ADRs and CYP 450 SNPs and is helpful in predicting the potential vulnerable genotype for some ADRs.


CONCLUSION
The newly proposed information theory based model has superiority performance in detecting the relation between SNP and ADR compared to the decision tree + LASSO regression model. The new model is more sensitive to detect ADRs compared to the old method, while the old method is more reliable. Therefore, the selection criteria for selecting algorithms should depend on the pragmatic needs.",2018,Combinatorial chemistry & high throughput screening
The Effectiveness of Western Creative Teaching Methods in China: An Action Research Project,"A total of 54 students from a design department in a Chinese higher education institution took part in a7-week action research project, which was intended to test the efficacy of U.K. creative teachingapproaches in the Chinese educational context. The study took the form of a quasi-field experiment. Acreative pedagogic model developed in the U.K. was used to deliver the Chinese curriculum to a classof second-year Bachelor of Arts Graphic Design students (the experimental class), while another class ofstudents with similar student composition (the control class) received the traditional Chinese model ofeducation. Visual outcomes produced by students from the two classes before and during the teachingintervention were evaluated for overall creativity, originality, design quality, and experimental range.Levels of student effort, motivation, enjoyment, and confidence in experimentation were measuredthrough a student questionnaire examining the impact of different pedagogic models on student creativeabilities and other related attributes. Both quantitative and qualitative results suggest that the creativemethods developed in the U.K. were highly effective in encouraging learner creativity and relatedattributes such as intrinsic motivation, enjoyment, and confidence.Keywords: creativity, pedogogy, motivationImagination is more important than knowledge, for knowledge islimited whereas imagination embraces the entire world, stimulatingprogress, giving birth to evolution.Â–Albert Einstein",2008,"Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts"
Sharp Thresholds for High-Dimensional and Noisy Sparsity Recovery Using $\ell _{1}$ -Constrained Quadratic Programming (Lasso),"The problem of consistently estimating the sparsity pattern of a vector beta* isin Rp based on observations contaminated by noise arises in various contexts, including signal denoising, sparse approximation, compressed sensing, and model selection. We analyze the behavior of l1-constrained quadratic programming (QP), also referred to as the Lasso, for recovering the sparsity pattern. Our main result is to establish precise conditions on the problem dimension p, the number k of nonzero elements in beta*, and the number of observations n that are necessary and sufficient for sparsity pattern recovery using the Lasso. We first analyze the case of observations made using deterministic design matrices and sub-Gaussian additive noise, and provide sufficient conditions for support recovery and linfin-error bounds, as well as results showing the necessity of incoherence and bounds on the minimum value. We then turn to the case of random designs, in which each row of the design is drawn from a N (0, Sigma) ensemble. For a broad class of Gaussian ensembles satisfying mutual incoherence conditions, we compute explicit values of thresholds 0 < thetasl(Sigma) les thetasu(Sigma) < +infin with the following properties: for any delta > 0, if n > 2 (thetasu + delta) klog (p- k), then the Lasso succeeds in recovering the sparsity pattern with probability converging to one for large problems, whereas for n < 2 (thetasl - delta)klog (p - k), then the probability of successful recovery converges to zero. For the special case of the uniform Gaussian ensemble (Sigma = Iptimesp), we show that thetasl = thetas<u = 1, so that the precise threshold n = 2 klog(p- k) is exactly determined.",2009,IEEE Transactions on Information Theory
Computed Tomography Features associated With the Eighth Edition TNM Stage Classification for Thymic Epithelial Tumors,"Purpose: The eighth edition of the TNM classification of malignant tumors for the first time includes an official staging system for thymic epithelial tumors (TETs) recognized by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC). Staging is critical for the management of TETs, and determining stage accurately from imaging has the potential to improve clinical outcomes. We examine preoperative computed tomography (CT) characteristics of TETs associated with AJCC/UICC pathologic TNM stage. Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, patients were included if they met all the following criteria: (1) diagnosis of TET, (2) had primary curative intent surgery performed at Stanford University, and (3) had available preoperative CT imaging for review. Tumor pathology was staged according to the eighth edition TNM classification. Fifteen CT scan features were examined from each patient case according to the International Thymic Malignancy Interest Group standard report terms in a blinded manner. A Lasso-regularized multivariate model was used to produce a weighted scoring system predictive of pathologic TNM stage. Results: Examining the 54 patients included, the following CT characteristics were associated with higher pathologic TNM stage when using the following scoring system: elevated hemidiaphragm (score of 6), vascular endoluminal invasion (score of 6), pleural nodule (score of 2), lobulated contour (score of 2), and heterogeneous internal density (score of 1). Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.76. Conclusions: TETs with clearly invasive or metastatic features seen on CT are associated with having higher AJCC/UICC pathologic TNM stage, as expected. However, features of lobulated contour and heterogeneous internal density are also associated with higher stage disease. These findings need to be validated in an independent cohort.",2018,Journal of Thoracic Imaging
Precise prediction of the radiation pneumonitis in lung cancer: an explorative preliminary mathematical model using genotype information,"Purpose: Radiation pneumonitis (RP) is the most significant dose-limiting toxicity and is one major obstacle for lung cancer radiotherapy. Grade â‰¥2 RP usually needs clinical interventions and serve RP could be life threatening. Clinically, tissue response could be strikingly different even two similar patients after identical radiotherapy. Previous methods for the RP prediction can hardly distinguish substantial variations among individuals. Reliable predictive factors or methods emphasizing the individual differences are strongly desired by clinical radiation oncologists. The purpose of this study is to develop an approach for the personalized RP risk prediction. Experimental Design: One hundred eighteen lung cancer patients who received radiotherapy were enrolled. Seven hundred thousand single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites were assessed via Generalized Linear Models via Lasso and Elastic-Net Regularization (GLMNET) to determine their synergistic effects on the RP risk prediction. Non-genetic factors including patient's phenotypes and clinical interventional parameters were separately assessed by statistic test. Based on the results of the aforementioned analysis, a multiple linear regression model named Radiation Pneumonitis Index (RPI) was built, for the assessment of Grade â‰¥2RP risk. Results: Only previous surgery and fractional dose were discovered statistical significantly associated with grade â‰¥2RP. Thirty-nine effective SNPs for predicting the Grade â‰¥2RP risk were discovered and their coefficients of the synergistic effect were determined. The RPI score can successfully distinguish the RPâ‰¥2 population with 92.0% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Conclusions: Individual radiation sensitivity can be determined with genotype information and personalized radiotherapy could be achieved based on mathematical model result.",2020,Journal of Cancer
Hypernetwork Construction and Feature Fusion Analysis Based on Sparse Group Lasso Method on fMRI Dataset,"Recent works have shown that the resting-state brain functional connectivity hypernetwork, where multiple nodes can be connected, are an effective technique for brain disease diagnosis and classification research. The lasso method was used to construct hypernetworks by solving sparse linear regression models in previous research. But, constructing a hypernetwork based on the lasso method simply selects a single variable, in that it lacks the ability to interpret the grouping effect. Considering the group structure problem, the previous study proposed to create a hypernetwork based on the elastic net and the group lasso methods, and the results showed that the former method had the best classification performance. However, the highly correlated variables selected by the elastic net method were not necessarily in the active set in the group. Therefore, we extended our research to address this issue. Herein, we propose a new method that introduces the sparse group lasso method to improve the construction of the hypernetwork by solving the group structure problem of the brain regions. We used the traditional lasso, group lasso method, and sparse group lasso method to construct a hypernetwork in patients with depression and normal subjects. Meanwhile, other clustering coefficients (clustering coefficients based on pairs of nodes) were also introduced to extract features with traditional clustering coefficients. Two types of features with significant differences obtained after feature selection were subjected to multi-kernel learning for feature fusion and classification using each method, respectively. The network topology results revealed differences among the three networks, where hypernetwork using the lasso method was the strictest; the group lasso, most lenient; and the sgLasso method, moderate. The network topology of the sparse group lasso method was similar to that of the group lasso method but different from the lasso method. The classification results show that the sparse group lasso method achieves the best classification accuracy by using multi-kernel learning, which indicates that better classification performance can be achieved when the group structure exists and is properly extended.",2020,Frontiers in Neuroscience
Hairpin ribozyme-antisense RNA constructs can act as molecular lassos,"We have developed a novel class of antisense agents, RNA Lassos, which are capable of binding to and circularizing around complementary target RNAs. The RNA Lasso consists of a fixed sequence derived from the hairpin ribozyme and an antisense segment whose size and sequence can be varied to base pair with accessible sites in the target RNA. The ribozyme catalyzes self-processing of the 5'- and 3'-ends of a transcribed Lasso precursor and ligates the processed ends to produce a circular RNA. The circular and linear forms of the self-processed Lasso coexist in an equilibrium that is dependent on both the Lasso sequence and the solution conditions. Lassos form strong, noncovalent complexes with linear target RNAs and form true topological linkages with circular targets. Lasso complexes with linear RNA targets were detected by denaturing gel electrophoresis and were found to be more stable than ordinary RNA duplexes. We show that expression of a fusion mRNA consisting of a sequence from the murine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) gene linked to luciferase reporter can be specifically and efficiently blocked by an anti-TNF Lasso. We also show in cell culture experiments that Lassos directed against Fas pre-mRNA were able to induce a change in alternative splicing patterns.",2008,Nucleic Acids Research

Numerical method for analysing open thin-walled structures under interaction of bending and torsion,"Abstract A computer program is developed to analyse concrete beams of open thin-walled sections, at different stages of loading from zero load to failure. The program is divided into two parts; the first part deals with the beam from zero load to cracking. Of course, loading is combined bending, shear and torsion (warping torsion and St Venant's torsion). In this part of the program, Vlassov's theory has been used. The cracking load is defined as that load which causes principal tensile stresses equal to the tensile strength of concrete. The second part of the program deals with all post-cracking stages of loading from cracking point to failure. An iteration procedure is used until full convergence occurs at a particular cross-section. The geometrical properties are calculated; these include the contribution of steel in the cross-section and that of concrete in the compressive zones. The mathematical model is given. The computer results are compared with earlier experimental results, and the two sets of results show reasonable agreement. The program is written in FORTRAN.",1990,Computers & Structures

Sparse Estimation of Movie Preferences via Constrained Optimization,"We propose extensions to traditional low-rank matrix completion methods used in movie recommendation systems, with the ability to recommend out-of-sample movies. We have implemented three recommendation systems; the first is a standard SVD model which learns abstract features for prediction and generalizes to out-of-sample movies using a nearest neighbor search. The second model is a constrained matrix completion using interpretable features instead of latent features. The third model is constrained matrix completion using LASSO regularization. We found that model 3 generalizes best due to the intrinsic sparsity of user preferences.",2016,
Variable Selection and Prediction with Incomplete High-dimensional Data.,"We propose a Multiple Imputation Random Lasso (mirl) method to select important variables and to predict the outcome for an epidemiological study of Eating and Activity in Teens. In this study 80% of individuals have at least one variable missing. Therefore, using variable selection methods developed for complete data after listwise deletion substantially reduces prediction power. Recent work on prediction models in the presence of incomplete data cannot adequately account for large numbers of variables with arbitrary missing patterns. We propose MIRL to combine penalized regression techniques with multiple imputation and stability selection. Extensive simulation studies are conducted to compare MIRL with several alternatives. MIRL outperforms other methods in high-dimensional scenarios in terms of both reduced prediction error and improved variable selection performance, and it has greater advantage when the correlation among variables is high and missing proportion is high. MIRL is shown to have improved performance when comparing with other applicable methods when applied to the study of Eating and Activity in Teens for the boys and girls separately, and to a subgroup of low social economic status (ses) Asian boys who are at high risk of developing obesity.",2016,The annals of applied statistics
Title Variable Selection via Penalized Likelihood Permalink,"Variable selection is vital to statistical data analyses. Many of procedures in use are ad hoc stepwise selection procedures, which are computationally expensive and ignore stochastic errors in the variable selection process of previous steps. An automatic and simultaneous variable selection procedure can be obtained by using a penalized likelihood method. In traditional linear models, the best subset selection and stepwise deletion methods coincide with a penalized leastsquares method when design matrices are orthonormal. In this paper, we propose a few new approaches to selecting variables for linear models, robust regression models and generalized linear models based on a penalized likelihood approach. A family of thresholding functions are proposed. The LASSO proposed by Tibshirani (1996) is a member of the penalized leastsquares with the L1-penalty. A smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) penalty function is introduced to ameliorate the properties of L1-penalty. A uni ed algorithm is introduced, which is backed up by statistical theory. The new approaches are compared with the ordinary leastsquares methods, the garrote method by Breiman (1995) and the LASSO method by Tibshirani (1996). Our simulation results show that the newly proposed methods compare favorably with other approaches as an automatic variable selection technique. Because of simultaneous selection of variables and estimation of parameters, we are able to give a simple estimated standard error formula, which is tested to be accurate enough for practical applications. Two real data examples illustrate the versatility and e ectiveness of the proposed approaches.",1999,

In contrast to the cases with peripheral nerve injury or polio, the availability of active muscles for transfers is very limited in tetraplegics. In both hands of a tetraplegic patient with Group 4 according to the international classification the brachioradialis was transferred to FPL and ECRL to FDP 2-5. The Zancolli-Lasso-procedure was performed in both hands as well as tenodesis of EPL proximally to the wrist. On the right side stabilisation of the thumb was achieved by CMS-1-fusion and on the left side the thumb got control by an abductor transfer using pronator teres and an interpositional tendon graft of the paralysed FDS 2. The result is described. Grip strength and Sollerman test were measured. Advantages and disadvantages of the two different procedures for thumb control are discussed, and the different abilities of gripping are shown.",1992,Helvetica chirurgica acta

Learning with Heterogeneous Side Information Fusion for Recommender Systems,"Recommender System (RS) is a hot area where artificial intelligence (AI) techniques can be effectively applied to improve performance. Since the well-known Netflix Challenge, collaborative filtering (CF) has become the most popular and effective recommendation method. Despite their success in CF, various AI techniques still have to face the data sparsity and cold start problems. Previous works tried to solve these two problems by utilizing auxiliary information, such as social connections among users and meta-data of items. However, they process different types of information separately, leading to information loss. In this work, we propose to utilize Heterogeneous Information Network (HIN), which is a natural and general representation of different types of data, to enhance CF-based recommending methods. HIN-based recommender systems face two problems: how to represent high-level semantics for recommendation and how to fuse the heterogeneous information to recommend. To address these problems, we propose to applying meta-graph to HIN-based RS and solve the information fusion problem with a ""matrix factorization (MF) + factorization machine (FM)"" framework. For the ""MF"" part, we obtain user-item similarity matrices from each meta-graph and adopt low-rank matrix approximation to get latent features for both users and items. For the ""FM"" part, we propose to apply FM with Group lasso (FMG) on the obtained features to simultaneously predict missing ratings and select useful meta-graphs. Experimental results on two large real-world datasets, i.e., Amazon and Yelp, show that our proposed approach is better than that of the state-of-the-art FM and other HIN-based recommending methods.",2018,ArXiv
Identification of a prognostic 5-Gene expression signature for gastric cancer,"PurposeGastric cancer (GC) is a major tumor throughout the world with remaining high morbidity and mortality. The aim is to generate a gene model to assess the prognoses risk of patients with GC.MethodsGene expression profiling of gastric cancer patients, GSE62254 (300 samples) and GSE26253 (432 samples), was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Univariate survival analysis and LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selectionator operator) (1000 iterations) of differentially expressed genes in GSE62254 was assessed using survival and glmnet in R package, respectively. Kaplanâ€“Meier analysis on the clustering algorithm from each regression model was performed to calculate the influence to the prognosis. Random samples in GSE26253 were analyzed in multivariate and univariate survival analysis for one thousand times to calculate statistical stability of each regression model.ResultsA total of 854 Genes were identified differentially expressed in GSE62254, among which 367 Genes were found influencing the prognoses. Six gene clusters were selected with good stability. Hereinto, five or more genes in 11-Gene model, TRPC1, SGCE, TNFRSF11A, LRRN1, HLF, CYS1, PPP1R14A, NOV, NBEA, CES1 and RGN, was available to evaluate the prognostic risk of GC patients in GSE26253 (P = 0.00445). The validity and reliability was validated.ConclusionIn conclusion, we successfully generated a stable 5-Gene model, which could be utilized to predict prognosis of GC patients and would contribute to postoperational treatment and follow-up strategies.",2016,Journal of Cancer Research and Clinical Oncology
Preoperative Prediction of Extracapsular Extension: Radiomics Signature Based on Magnetic Resonance Imaging to Stage Prostate Cancer,"PurposeTo investigate and validate the potential role of a radiomics signature in predicting the side-specific probability of extracapsular extension (ECE) of prostate cancer (PCa).ProceduresThe preoperative magnetic resonance imaging data of 238 prostatic samples from 119 enrolled PCa patients were retrospectively assessed. The samples with were randomized in a two-to-one ratio into training (nâ€‰=â€‰74) and validation (nâ€‰=â€‰45) datasets. The radiomics features were derived from T2-weighted images (T2WIs). The optimal radiomics features were identified from the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression model and were used to construct a predictive radiomics signature via dimension reduction and selection approaches. The association between the radiomics signatures and pathological ECE status was explored. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to assess the discriminatory ability of the signature. The calibration performance and clinical usefulness of the radiomics signature were subsequently assessed by calibration curve and decision curve analyses.ResultsThe proposed radiomics signature that incorporated 17 selected radiomics features was significantly associated with pathological ECE outcomes (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) in both the training and validation datasets. The constructed model displayed good discrimination, with areas under the curve (AUC) of 0.906 (95Â % confidence interval (CI), 0.847, 0.948) and 0.821 (95Â % CI, 0.726, 0.894) for the training and validation datasets, respectively, and had a good calibration performance. The clinical utility of this model was confirmed through decision curve analysis.ConclusionsThe radiomics signature based on T2WIs showed the potential to predict the side-specific probability of pathological ECE status and can facilitate the preoperative individualized predictions for PCa patients.",2019,Molecular Imaging and Biology
ParNes: a rapidly convergent algorithm for accurate recovery of sparse and approximately sparse signals,"In this article, we propose an algorithm, nesta-lasso, for the lasso problem, i.e., an underdetermined linear least-squares problem with a 1-norm constraint on the solution. We prove under the assumption of the restricted isometry property (rip) and a sparsity condition on the solution, that nesta-lasso is guaranteed to be almost always locally linearly convergent. As in the case of the algorithm nesta, proposed by Becker, Bobin, and CandÃ¨s, we rely on Nesterovâ€™s accelerated proximal gradient method, which takes $O(\sqrt {1/\varepsilon })$ iterations to come within $\varepsilon > 0$ of the optimal value. We introduce a modification to Nesterovâ€™s method that regularly updates the prox-center in a provably optimal manner. The aforementioned linear convergence is in part due to this modification. In the second part of this article, we attempt to solve the basis pursuit denoising (bpdn) problem (i.e., approximating the minimum 1-norm solution to an underdetermined least squares problem) by using nesta-lasso in conjunction with the Pareto root-finding method employed by van den Berg and Friedlander in their spgl1 solver. The resulting algorithm is called parnes. We provide numerical evidence to show that it is comparable to currently available solvers.",2012,Numerical Algorithms
Response of atrial fibrillation to pulmonary vein antrum isolation is directly related to resumption and delay of pulmonary vein conduction.,"BACKGROUND
The role of pulmonary vein (PV) isolation in ablative treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) has been debated in conflicting reports. We sought to compare PV conduction in patients who had no AF recurrence (group I), patients who could maintain sinus rhythm on antiarrhythmic medication (group II), and patients who had recurrent AF despite antiarrhythmic medication (group III) after PV antrum isolation (PVAI).


METHODS AND RESULTS
PV conduction was examined in consecutive patients undergoing second PVAI for AF recurrence. We also recruited some patients cured of AF to undergo a repeat, limited electrophysiological study at >3 months after PVAI. All patients underwent PVAI with an intracardiac echocardiography (ICE)-guided approach with complete isolation of all 4 PV antra (PVA). The number of PVs with recurrent conduction and the shortest atrial to PV (A-PV) conduction delay was measured with the use of consistent Lasso positions defined by ICE. Late AF recurrence was defined as AF >2 months after PVAI with the patient off medications. Patients in groups I (n=26), II (n=37), and III (n=44) did not differ at baseline (38% permanent AF; ejection fraction 53+/-6%). Recurrence of PV-left atrial (LA) conduction was seen in 1.7+/-0.8 and 2.2+/-0.8 PVAs for groups II and III but only in 0.2+/-0.4 for group I (P=0.02). In patients with recurrent PV-LA conduction, the A-PV delay increased from the first to second procedure by 69+/-47% for group III, 267+/-110% for group II, and 473+/-71% for group I (P<0.001). When pacing was at a faster rate, A-PV block developed in all 5 of the group I patients with recurrent PV-LA conduction.


CONCLUSIONS
The majority of patients with drug-free cure show no PV-LA conduction recurrence. Substantial A-PV delay is seen in patients able to maintain sinus rhythm on antiarrhythmic medication or cured of AF compared with patients who fail PVAI.",2005,Circulation
Connection between SPICE and Square-Root LASSO for sparse parameter estimation,In this note we show that the sparse estimation technique named Square-Root LASSO (SR-LASSO) is connected to a previously introduced method named SPICE. More concretely we prove that the SR-LASSO with a unit weighting factor is identical to SPICE. Furthermore we show via numerical simulations that the performance of the SR-LASSO changes insignificantly when the weighting factor is varied. SPICE stands for sparse iterative covariance-based estimation and LASSO for least absolute shrinkage and selection operator.,2014,Signal Process.
Hyperparameter-selection for sparse regression: A probablistic approach,"The choice of hyperparameter(s) notably affects the support recovery in LASSO-like sparse regression problems, acting as an implicit model order selection. Parameters are typically selected using cross-validation or various ad hoc approaches. These often overestimates the resulting model order, aiming to minimize the prediction error rather than maximizing the support recovery. In this work, we propose a probabilistic approach to selecting hyperparameters in order to maximize the support recovery, quantifying the type I error (false positive rate) using extreme value analysis, such that the regularization level is selected as an appropriate quantile. By instead solving the scaled LASSO problem, the proposed choice of hyperparameter becomes almost independent of the noise variance. Simulation examples illustrate how the proposed method outperforms both cross-validation and the Bayesian Information Criterion in terms of computational complexity and support recovery.",2017,"2017 51st Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers"

Expression Status And Prognostic Value Of M6A-associated Genes in Gastric Cancer,"Purpose: Gastric cancer (GC) is a primary cause of cancer-associated mortality worldwide. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is one of the most common RNA modifications that involves in the progression of numerous cancers. However, the expression status and function of m6A-related genes in gastric cancer is still not well understood. The current study is aimed to investigate the expression status and determinate prognostic value of m6A-related genes in gastric cancer. Methods: m6A-asssociated gene expression was evaluated via analyzing the expression data of GC patients from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The protein expression levels of m6A-associated molecules were further validated by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining data from GC tissue microarray (TMA) cohort and Human Protein Atlas (HPA) database. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to assess the prognostic value of m6A-associated genes in gastric cancer. Risk score model was established by lasso COX regression analysis and its prognostic predicted efficiency was assessed by the receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve. Cox regression analyses were used for exploring risk factors related to GC patient prognosis. Results: Most of m6A-related genes were upregulated at both mRNA and protein levels in gastric cancer tissues compared with that in normal gastric tissues. The expression levels of m6A-related genes were associated with clinicopathological features including race, age and TNM stage. High expression of WTAP and FTO predicted poor prognosis of GC patients. Survival analysis demonstrated that patients with high-risk scores had worse overall survival (OS) and ROC curves suggested the prediction performance for gastric patients. Moreover, Cox regression analyses indicated that m6A risk model score was a prognostic factor for OS and FTO upregulation might be a potential independent prognostic factor for recurrence-free survival (RFS) in gastric cancer patients. Conclusion: m6A-related genes were dysregulated in GC and were closely associated with prognosis of GC patients. FTO might serve as a novel prognostic biomarker for gastric cancer, while the m6A-related risk score might be informative for risk assessment and prognostic stratification.",2020,Journal of Cancer
"Identifying drug-pathway association pairs based on L1L2,1-integrative penalized matrix decomposition","The traditional methods of drug discovery follow the ""one drug-one target"" approach, which ignores the cellular and physiological environment of the action mechanism of drugs. However, pathway-based drug discovery methods can overcome this limitation. This kind of method, such as the Integrative Penalized Matrix Decomposition (iPaD) method, identifies the drug-pathway associations by taking the lasso-type penalty on the regularization term. Moreover, instead of imposing the L1-norm regularization, the L2,1-Integrative Penalized Matrix Decomposition (L2,1-iPaD) method imposes the L2,1-norm penalty on the regularization term. In this paper, based on the iPaD and L2,1-iPaD methods, we propose a novel method named L1L2,1-iPaD (L1L2,1-Integrative Penalized Matrix Decomposition), which takes the sum of the L1-norm and L2,1-norm penalties on the regularization term. Besides, we perform permutation test to assess the significance of the identified drug-pathway association pairs and compute the P-values. Compared with the existing methods, our method can identify more drug-pathway association pairs which have been validated in the CancerResource database. In order to identify drug-pathway associations which are not validated in the CancerResource database, we retrieve published papers to prove these associations. The results on two real datasets prove that our method can achieve better enrichment for identified association pairs than the iPaD and L2,1-iPaD methods.",2017,Oncotarget
Linguistic Structured Sparsity in Text Categorization,"We introduce three linguistically motivated structured regularizers based on parse trees, topics, and hierarchical word clusters for text categorization. These regularizers impose linguistic bias in feature weights, enabling us to incorporate prior knowledge into conventional bagof-words models. We show that our structured regularizers consistently improve classification accuracies compared to standard regularizers that penalize features in isolation (such as lasso, ridge, and elastic net regularizers) on a range of datasets for various text prediction problems: topic classification, sentiment analysis, and forecasting.",2014,
[Morbidity and mortality in obstetrical referral patients admitted to Bobo-Dioulasso hospital Burkina Faso],In 1991 in Burkina Faso 741 pregnant women were referred and admitted to Sanon Souro National Hospital in Bobo-Dioulasso due to an obstetrical emergency. The median age and parity were 22 years and 3 respectively. Median distance between the referral center and the hospital was 33 km. The chief modes of transport were the fire department especially for women from Bobo-Dioulasso state or private ambulances and a nongovernmental organizations vehicle. 84.5% of the women delivered at the hospital while the other were admitted postpartum. The leading conditions responsible for referrals were obstructed labor hemorrhaging and infections. Uterine rupture was most common among women coming from a distance of at least 50 km (p = 0.0004). 5.4% of the referrals died. The maternal death rate increased as the distance from the referral center and the hospital increased (relative risk [RR] for >100 km = 2.9; p = 0.006). Neither parity nor maternal age affected maternal mortality. The perinatal mortality rate was 42%. Perinatal deaths increased with distance from the referral center [RR = 1.6; p = 0.0001). Maternal age was not associated with perinatal deaths. Women who had already had 4 children were more likely to experience perinatal death than those with fewer than 4 children (RR = 1.4; p = 0.0001). No significant seasonal variation in the number of referrals or mortality rates occurred during the 12-month study period.,1993,Annales de la Societe belge de medecine tropicale
81 Identifying and predicting novel classes of long-term disease trajectories for patients with juvenile dermatomyositis using growth mixture models,"Objectives Uncertainty around clinical heterogeneity and outcomes for patients with juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) represents a major burden of disease and a challenge for clinical management. We sought to identify novel classes of patients having similar temporal patterns in disease activity and clinical features at baseline that predict class membership. Methods Data were obtained for n=519 patients, including demographic and clinical features at baseline, and the physicianâ€™s global assessment of disease (PGA) and the modified disease activity score for skin at all recorded visits. Growth mixture models (GMM) were fit to identify classes of patients with similar trajectories. Baseline predictors of class membership were analysed using lasso regression. Results GMM analysis of global disease activity identified 2 classes of patients. Patients in Class 1 (88.6%) tended to improve their PGA over time, while patients in Class 2 (11.6%) tended to have more ongoing disease. Lasso regression analysis identified abnormal respiration, lipodystrophy and an interaction between them as baseline predictors of Class 2 membership, with odds ratios of 1.71, 1.91 and 1.66, respectively. GMM analysis of skin disease activity identified 3 classes of patients. Patients in Classes 1 (14%) and 2 (11%) had higher levels of skin disease at diagnosis that steadily improved or remained high, respectively. Patients in Class 3 (66%) began with lower levels of skin disease that improved more quickly. Conclusions GMM analysis identified novel JDM sub-phenotypes based on longitudinal global and skin disease activities. Abnormal respiration and lipodystrophy at baseline predicted the group of patients with ongoing disease.",2019,Archives of Disease in Childhood
The expanding structural variety among bacteriocins from Gram-positive bacteria.,"Bacteria use various strategies to compete in an ecological niche, including the production of bacteriocins. Bacteriocins are ribosomally synthesized antibacterial peptides, and it has been postulated that the majority of Gram-positive bacteria produce one or more of these natural products. Bacteriocins can be used in food preservation and are also considered as potential alternatives to antibiotics. The majority of bacteriocins from Gram-positive bacteria had been traditionally divided into two major classes, namely lantibiotics, which are post-translationally modified bacteriocins, and unmodified bacteriocins. The last decade has seen an expanding number of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) in Gram-positive bacteria that have antibacterial activity. These include linear azol(in)e-containing peptides, thiopeptides, bottromycins, glycocins, lasso peptides and lipolanthines. In addition, the three-dimensional (3D) structures of a number of modified and unmodified bacteriocins have been elucidated in recent years. This review gives an overview on the structural variety of bacteriocins from Gram-positive bacteria. It will focus on the chemical and 3D structures of these peptides, and their interactions with receptors and membranes, structure-function relationships and possible modes of action.",2018,FEMS microbiology reviews
Subsurface characterization with localized ensemble Kalman filter employing adaptive thresholding,"Abstract Ensemble Kalman filter, EnKF, as a Monte Carlo sequential data assimilation method has emerged promisingly for subsurface media characterization during past decade. Due to high computational cost of large ensemble size, EnKF is limited to small ensemble set in practice. This results in appearance of spurious correlation in covariance structure leading to incorrect or probable divergence of updated realizations. In this paper, a universal/adaptive thresholding method is presented to remove and/or mitigate spurious correlation problem in the forecast covariance matrix. This method is, then, extended to regularize Kalman gain directly. Four different thresholding functions have been considered to threshold forecast covariance and gain matrices. These include hard, soft, lasso and Smoothly Clipped Absolute Deviation (SCAD) functions. Three benchmarks are used to evaluate the performances of these methods. These benchmarks include a small 1D linear model and two 2D water flooding (in petroleum reservoirs) cases whose levels of heterogeneity/nonlinearity are different. It should be noted that beside the adaptive thresholding, the standard distance dependant localization and bootstrap Kalman gain are also implemented for comparison purposes. We assessed each setup with different ensemble sets to investigate the sensitivity of each method on ensemble size. The results indicate that thresholding of forecast covariance yields more reliable performance than Kalman gain. Among thresholding function, SCAD is more robust for both covariance and gain estimation. Our analyses emphasize that not all assimilation cycles do require thresholding and it should be performed wisely during the early assimilation cycles. The proposed scheme of adaptive thresholding outperforms other methods for subsurface characterization of underlying benchmarks.",2014,Advances in Water Resources
Identifizierung und Trennung flÃ¼chtiger Stoffe durch Cosublimation und Codestillation im CADY-Rohr,"SummaryA method for the separation and identification of small amounts of volatile substances by a carrier-gas volatilization technique, previously reported by Cady and Siegwarth [1], has been improved by the development of an apparatus which permits to conduct the volatilization with high reproducibility and at constant temperatures. The composition of the evaporating gas mixtures is recorded by a Gow-Mac gas density balance. The new technique allows the evaluation of vapour pressures, thermodynamic data of vaporization, molar masses, the separation of subliming and distilling mixtures, and gives information on the ideal or non-ideal behaviour of low boiling mixtures (formation of azeotropes). Finally, molecular complexes can be recognized and characterized thermodynamically.ZusammenfassungDas erstmals von Cady u.

Zur olfaktorischen Navigation der VÃ¶gel,"In contrast to earlier navigation hypotheses, based as they are on theoretical constructs deduced from our knowledge of the physical world, the notion of olfactory navigation is an unexpected outcome of empirical research. Referring to sceptical articles on the issue in this journal and elsewhere (e.g. Schmidt-Koenig 1985, 1987, 2001, Wiltschko 1996), and in order to fill a gap in a recent review on avian navigation (Wiltschko & Wiltschko 1999), I describe the most instructive experiments providing evidence that birds are able to home by utilizing atmospheric trace gases perceived by the sense of smell. (1) When released in an unfamiliar distant area, homing pigeons with bisected olfactory nerves fly considerable distances, but fail to approach the home site (Fig. 1, 2, 3). Largely analogous treatments in control birds and experimentals make it extremely unlikely that the failures are due to non-olfactory side-effects. (2) Elimination of trace gases from the inhaled air by means of charcoal filters prior to release, combined with nasal anaesthesia upon release, prevents initial homeward orientation, whereas nasal anaesthesia alone (after smelling of natural release-site air) does not (Fig. 5). (3) Pigeons exposed to natural air at one site and released, without access to natural air, at a quite different site, fly in a direction corresponding to homeward from the site of exposure, but not from the current actual position (Fig. 6). (4) Long-term screening from winds in an aviary at home prevents subsequent homeward orientation from distant sites. Deflecting or reversing winds in a home aviary results in accordingly deflected or reversed orientation (Fig. 7). (5) From areas made familiar by previous flights homing is possible also on a non-olfactory basis. This can be explained in terms of the utilisation of visual landscape features. In as far as related experiments were conducted using reliable methods, the results are unequivocal. On the whole, they can be understood only provided that the birds are able to deduce their position relative to the home site from atmospheric trace gases, and that this ability requires previous opportunity to correlate current wind conditions with simultaneous olfactory conditions at the home site over a lengthy period of time. As an attempt to explain the underlying system, a working hypothesis is presented which postulates that (a) long-range gradients exist in the ratios among several airborne trace substances and that (b) their directions can be derived, at the home site, from changes of ratios in dependence on wind direction. Atmospheric hydrocarbons investigated by means of gas chromatography in an area covering 400 km in diameter did in fact include such postulated ratio gradients (Fig. 8). Their directions were fairly stable even under varying conditions of weather and winds. Correlations among gradient directions and changes of ratios according to wind directions were also found, but the long-term angular relationships have not yet been definitely determined. By means of computer simulations using actually measured atmospheric values as inputs, navigational performances could be created corresponding to those observed in homing pigeons (Fig. 9). Experiments with swifts and starlings indicate that olfactory navigation methods are applied also by wild-living species (Fig. 10 and Fig. 11). A schematic model (Fig. 12) illustrates how they might be integrated in the process of long-distance migratory orientation. Also, the question is raised whether long-distance foraging flights of albatrosses (Fig. 13) and other oceanic birds might be controlled by olfactory signals involving long-range ratio gradients of atmospheric trace gases (Fig. 14). A few experiments are suggested for testing the potential application of olfactory navigation in natural bird life. Die Schlussfolgerung, dass VÃ¶gel auf geruchlicher Basis mit Hilfe atmosphÃ¤rischer Spurenstoffe aus unbekannten Gebieten zu ihrem Heimatort zurÃ¼ck finden, ergibt sich nicht, wie frÃ¼here Hypothesen Ã¼ber. das HeimfindevermÃ¶gen, aus einem theoretischen Ansatz, sondern aus einer Reihe von Experimentalbefunden. (1) In entfernte fremde Regionen verfrachtete Brieftauben fliegen nur dann heimwÃ¤rts, wenn sie riechen kÃ¶nnen; Tauben mit durchtrennten Geruchsnerven fliegen zwar oft weite Strecken, nÃ¤hern sich aber nicht der Heimat. Weitgehend analoge Behandlungen der Versuchs- und KontrollvÃ¶gel machen es sehr unwahrscheinlich, dass das Versagen der Ersteren auf geruchsunabhÃ¤ngigen Nebenwirkungen beruht. (2) Die Entfernung von Spurengasen aus der Atemluft durch Aktivkohlefilter vor der Auflassung, kombiniert mit nasaler Lokalnarkose wÃ¤hrend des Abflugs, verhindert heimgerichtete AbflÃ¼ge, wÃ¤hrend die Lokalnarkose allein (nach dem Riechen ungefilterter Luft am Auflassort) das nicht tut. (3) Tauben, die an einem Ort der natÃ¼rlichen Umgebungsluft exponiert, aber dann ohne Zugang zur natÃ¼rlichen Luft an einem entgegengesetzt gelegenen Ort aufgelassen werden, fliegen so ab, als wÃ¤ren sie am olfaktorischen Expositionsort und nicht am tatsÃ¤chlichen Auflassungsort. (4) Langfristiges Abschirmen des Windes in der Heimatvoliere bewirkt vÃ¶lliges Versagen der Heimorientierung, Umlenken oder Umkehren des Windes bewirkt voraussagbare Ablenkung oder Umkehrung der Abflugrichtungen am Auflassort. (5) Aus durch frÃ¼here FlÃ¼ge bekannten Gebieten ist auch nicht-olfaktorisches Heimfinden mÃ¶glich. Es ist durch Nutzung visueller Landschaftskenntnis erklÃ¤rbar. Soweit entsprechende Versuche methodisch einwandfrei durchgefÃ¼hrt wurden, sind die Resultate widerspruchsfrei. In ihrer Gesamtheit sind sie nur dann verstÃ¤ndlich, wenn man folgert, dass die VÃ¶gel Spurengase der AtmosphÃ¤re verwerten, aus denen sie ihre Position relativ zum Heimatort ableiten kÃ¶nnen, vorausgesetzt, dass sie dort Ã¼ber lÃ¤ngere Zeit die jeweilige Wind-Situation mit der gleichzeitigen Geruchs-Situation korrelieren konnten. Zur ErklÃ¤rung des zugrunde liegenden Systems dient eine Arbeitshypothese, die postuliert, dass es (a) weitrÃ¤umige Gradienten in den ProportionsverhÃ¤ltnissen zwischen verschiedenen Spurensubstanzen gibt und dass (b) deren Richtungen sich am Heimatort aus der Ã„nderung der Proportionen in AbhÃ¤ngigkeit von der Windrichtung ermitteln lassen. Gaschromatische Untersuchungen atmosphÃ¤rischer Kohlenwasserstoffe in einem Areal von 400 km Durchmesser haben gezeigt, dass das erste Postulat grundsÃ¤tzlich erfÃ¼llt ist und dass die Richtungen rÃ¤umlicher Proportionsgradienten unter verschiedenen Wetter und WindverhÃ¤ltnissen relativ stabil erhalten bleiben. Korrelationen im Sinne des zweiten Postulats sind ebenfalls erwiesen, doch sind die langfristigen Richtungsbeziehungen noch nicht hinreichend geklÃ¤rt. In Computersimulationen mit gemessenen AtmosphÃ¤renwerten als EingangsgrÃ¶ÃŸen konnten Navigationsleistungen erzeugt werden, die denen von Brieftauben entsprechen. Versuche mit Mauerseglern und Staren weisen darauf hin, dass die olfaktorische Navigation eine auch unter WildvÃ¶geln verbreitete FÃ¤higkeit ist. Die Vermutung liegt nahe, dass sie beim Vogelzug zum Auffinden des engeren Brut- bzw. Ãœberwinterungsareals dient. Es sollte geprÃ¼ft werden, ob sie auch bei den weitrÃ¤umigen Exkursionen von Albatrossen und anderen HochseevÃ¶geln eine Rolle spielt.",2006,Journal fÃ¼r Ornithologie

However, in the past, their use in the field of robotics has been limited to simple target designation, without exploring their potential as versatile input devices. This paper proposes to create a laser pointer-based user interface for giving various instructions to a robot by applying stroke gesture recognition to the laser's trajectory. Through this interface, the user can draw stroke gestures using a laser pointer to specify target objects and commands for the robot to execute accordingly. This system, which includes lasso and dwelling gestures for object selection, stroke gestures for robot operation, and push-button commands for movement cancellation, has been refined from its prototype form through several user-study evaluations. Our results suggest that laser pointers can be effective not only for target designation but also for specifying command and target location for a robot to perform.",2009,
Optimization of turn-back primers in isothermal amplification,"The application of isothermal amplification technologies is rapidly expanding and currently covers different areas such as infectious disease, genetic disorder and drug dosage adjustment. Meanwhile, many of such technologies have complex reaction processes and often require a fine-tuned primer set where existing primer design tools are not sufficient. We have developed a primer selection system for one important primer, the turn-back primer (TP), which is commonly used in loop-mediated amplification (LAMP) and smart amplification process (SmartAmp). We chose 78 parameters related to the primer and target sequence, and explored their relationship to amplification speed using experimental data for 1344 primer combinations. We employed the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method for parameter selection and estimation of their numerical coefficients. We subsequently evaluated our prediction model using additional independent experiments and compared to the LAMP primer design tool, Primer Explorer version4 (PE4). The evaluation showed that our approach yields a superior primer design in isothermal amplification and is robust against variations in the experimental setup. Our LASSO regression analysis revealed that availability of the 3'- and 5'-end of the primer are particularly important factors for efficient isothermal amplification.

Boosting ridge regression,"There are several possible approaches to combining ridge regression with boosting techniques. In the simple or naive approach the ridge estimator is used to fit iteratively the current residuals yielding an alternative to the usual ridge estimator. In partial boosting only part of the regression parameters are reestimated within one step of the iterative procedure. The technique allows to distinguish between mandatory variables that are always included in the analysis and optional variables that are chosen only if relevant. The resulting procedure selects optional variables in a similar way as the Lasso, yielding a reduced set of influential variables, while allowing for regularized estimation of the mandatory parameters. The suggested procedures are investigated within the classical framework of continuous response variables as well as in the case of generalized linear models. The performance in terms of prediction and the identification of relevant variables is compared to several competitors as the Lasso and the more recently proposed elastic net. For the evaluation of the identification of relevant variables pseudo ROC curves are introduced.",2007,Comput. Stat. Data Anal.
Die Kirchenmusik in Ã–sterreich,"Laienkreise und viele Fachmusiker denken bei der Bezeichnung Kirchenmusik zunÃ¤chst an einige kirchliche Standardwerke, etwa an die Missa solemnis von Beethoven oder an die Hohe Messe von Badi, und verbinden mit dem Ã¼brigen kirchenmusikalischen Schaffen die Vorstellung eines abseits des eigentlichen Musiklebens bestehenden Arbeitsgebietes, dem keine allgemeine Anteilnahme zukommt, das vom groÃŸen Kulturgeschehen der Zeit unberÃ¼hrt bleibt und rein zweckmÃ¤ÃŸig orientiert ist, das infolgedessen auch hinsichtlich seiner inneren Bedeutung gegenÃ¼ber der weltlichen Musik eine nicht unbetrÃ¤chtliche Minderbewertung erfÃ¤hrt. Diese Einstellung ist abwegig. Sie bleibt an der OberflÃ¤che der Erscheinungen haften und dringt nicht zum Wesen der Sache vor. Sie berÃ¼cksichtigt weder die psychologischen Voraussetzungen des kÃ¼nstlerischen Schaffens noch das im Verlaufe der Jahrhunderte gewachsene kirchenmusikalische Werk selbst. Jedes Kunstwerk entsteht durch die Auswirkung aller geistigen und seelischen KrÃ¤fte, kurz der ganzen PersÃ¶nlichkeit des Schaffenden. Der kirchliche, auÃŸerweltliche, transzendentale Erlebniskreis des KÃ¼nstlers wird in gleicher Weise aus den tiefsten Quellen der PersÃ¶nlichkeit gespeist wie der Bereich des weltverbundenen Daseins. Die kirchliche SphÃ¤re ist, vergleichsweise gesagt, kein Segment des seelischen Lebens, sondern ein Sektor. Sie erfaÃŸt alle Schichten des inneren Lebens. Derselbe Mozart spricht aus dem Requiem und dem Don Giovanni, derselbe J. Seb. Bach aus der Hohen Messe und aus der Kunst der Fuge, derselbe Orlando di Lasso aus dem Magnum opus musicum und den Deutschen Liedlein und Madrigalen. Eine grundsÃ¤tzliche Scheidung der geistlichen und der weltlichen Kunst ist nicht mÃ¶glich. Beide Gebiete sind in der Person des schaffenden KÃ¼nstlers untrennbar vereinigt. Es kann vorkommen, daÃŸ die auf das Ãœberweltliche hingerichteten KrÃ¤fte verkÃ¼mmert sind. Doch dieser Fall stellt keinen Normalzustand dar, sondern eine Unteroder Fehlentwicklung. Selbst der vollkommene Materialist fÃ¼hlt in dem Wirken der NaturkrÃ¤fte eine seinem EinflÃ¼sse oft weitgehend entzogene, auÃŸerhalb seiner Macht stehende, diese Ã¼bersteigende und in diesem Sinne transzendentale Komponente seines Daseins, die oft schicksalhaft und unabwendbar in sein Leben eingreift.

Leveraging Loyalty Programs Using Competitor Based Targeting,"Loyalty programs are widely used by firms but their effectiveness is subject to debate. These programs provide discounts and perks to loyal customers and are costly to administer, and with uncertain effectiveness at increasing spending or stealing business from rivals. We use a large new dataset on retail purchases before and after joining a loyalty program (LP) at the customer level to evaluate what determines LP effectiveness. We exploit detailed spatial data on customer and store locations, including locations of competing firms. A simple analysis shows that location relative to competitors is the strongest predictor of LP effectiveness, suggesting that LPs work primarily through business stealing and not through other demand expansion. We next estimate what variables best predict LP effectiveness using high-dimensional data on spatial relationships between customers, the focal firmâ€™s stores, and competing stores as well as customersâ€™ historical spending patterns. We use LASSO regularization to show that spatial relationships are more predictive of LP effects than are past sales data. Finally, we show how firms can use this type of predictive analytics model to leverage customer and competitor location data to substantially increase the performance of their LP through spatially driven targeting rules.",2019,

Arte Import/Export. Il caso della Galleria Niccoli e lâ€™attivitÃ  espositiva del Centro per lâ€™Arte Contemporanea Italia Giappone,"Nel 1986 Giuseppe Niccoli e Chifuku Kubota fondano il Centro per lâ€™Arte Contemporanea Italia Giappone, mossi dal desiderio di creare una via di comunicazione che favorisse gli scambi artistici e il mercato in entrambe le direzioni. Lâ€™ACIG ha promosso unâ€™intensa attivitÃ  espositiva che ha portato in Italia alcuni dei piÃ¹ importanti artisti giapponesi contemporanei e in Giappone il meglio dei movimenti artistici italiani del Novecento. In particolare, il Centro ha trovato grande entusiasmo da parte di rinomati musei giapponesi, permettendo alla Galleria di affermarsi come realtÃ  di spicco anche nel sistema dellâ€™arte internazionale. In questi mesi la mostra Arte cinetica e programmata in Italia 1958-1968 attraversa il Giappone, fino al settembre 2015. Il saggio vuole ricostruire lâ€™attivitÃ  espositiva del Centro su tutti i livelli. Ai fini della completezza, il contributo Ã¨ integrato da unâ€™intervista allo stesso Giuseppe Niccoli. In 1986 Giuseppe Niccoli and Chifuku Kubota establish the Italy-Japan Center for Contemporary Art (Centro per lâ€™Arte Contemporanea Italia Giappone, ACIG), aimed to create a communication channel that encouraged artistic exchanges and the market in both directions. ACIG promoted many exhibitions, that imported in Italy some of the most important japanese contemporary artists and exported in Japan the best italian artistic movements of Nineteenth century. ACIG especially found enthusiasm from famous japanese museums, allowing the Niccoli Gallery to become a prominent reality inside the international art system. In recent months, the exhibition Arte cinetica e programmata in Italia 19581968 goes across Japan, until September 2015. The present essay wants to outline ACIGâ€™s history and exhibitions on all levels. For clarity, the essay is accomplished by an interview with Giuseppe Niccoli himself.

Sparse inverse covariance estimation with the graphical lasso.,"We consider the problem of estimating sparse graphs by a lasso penalty applied to the inverse covariance matrix. Using a coordinate descent procedure for the lasso, we develop a simple algorithm--the graphical lasso--that is remarkably fast: It solves a 1000-node problem ( approximately 500,000 parameters) in at most a minute and is 30-4000 times faster than competing methods. It also provides a conceptual link between the exact problem and the approximation suggested by Meinshausen and BÃ¼hlmann (2006). We illustrate the method on some cell-signaling data from proteomics.",2008,Biostatistics
On the Equivalence of Sparse Statistical Problems,"Sparsity is a widely used and theoretically well understood notion that has allowed inference to be statistically and computationally possible in the high-dimensional setting. Sparse Principal Component Analysis (SPCA) and Sparse Linear Regression (SLR) are two problems that have a wide range of applications and have attracted a tremendous amount of attention in the last two decades as canonical examples of statistical problems in high dimension. A variety of algorithms have been proposed for both SPCA and SLR, but their literature has been disjoint for the most part. We have a fairly good understanding of conditions and regimes under which these algorithms succeed. But is there be a deeper connection between computational structure of SPCA and SLR? In this paper we show how to efficiently transform a blackbox solver for SLR into an algorithm for SPCA. Assuming the SLR solver satisfies prediction error guarantees achieved by existing efficient algorithms such as those based on the Lasso, we show that the SPCA algorithm derived from it achieves state of the art performance, matching guarantees for testing and for support recovery under the single spiked covariance model as obtained by the current best polynomial-time algorithms. Our reduction not only highlights the inherent similarity between the two problems, but also, from a practical standpoint, it allows one to obtain a collection of algorithms for SPCA directly from known algorithms for SLR. Experiments on simulated data show that these algorithms perform well. Thesis Supervisor: Guy Bresler Title: Assistant Professor",2017,
Evidence for a herpesvirus as an etiologic agent of marek's disease.,"Studies were conducted to determine the relationship of a cellassociated herpesvirus (MDHV), which was isolated from chickens with Marek's disease (MD), to the etiology of MD. The following obervations were made: 1) MDHV was isolated from 85 of 86 chickens with MD lesions but from only 20 of 58 similarly-exposed chicks lacking lesions and none of 43 control chicks. 2) Of 70 tissue samples assayed by parallel inoculation of chicks and cell cultures, 64 produced similar results by both. 3) MDHV was isolated from each of 6 laboratory MD strains. 4) Fifty-five of 57 MD-inoculated cultures with MDHV plaques produced MD when inoculated into chicks and the overall agreement between plaque response and in-",1969,Avian diseases
Application of GLASSO in Variable Selection and Crash Prediction at Unsignalized Intersections,"AbstractIn this paper, a new promising variable screening technique is proposed to select important covariates and to improve crash prediction; the group least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (GLASSO). The GLASSOâ€™s main power lies in its ability to deal with data sets havinga large number of categorical variables, the case in this study. Identifying the significant factors affecting the safety of unsignalized intersections was also an essential objective. Two applications of GLASSO were investigated: before fitting the negative binomial (NB) model, and before fitting the promising multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) technique using extensive data representing 2,475 unsignalized intersections. Regarding the NB models, GLASSO yielded close prediction capability to the backward deletion and random forest techniques. Also, MARS model fitting after using GLASSO relatively outperformed that after using random forest, with similar prediction performance.

"Academic medical centers, private industry, and clinical trials: how do we achieve fairness, objectivity, and balance?","The availability of funding for biomedical research frompublic sources is diminishing in industrialized nations.Many of these countries have historically committedenormous resources to the medical research process. Inthe US, the budget of the National Institutes of Health(NIH), which provides the majority of public researchfunding for clinical and basic science investigations, hasremained nearly unaltered for four consecutive years. Infact, the NIH budget has consistently been $28 billion(USD) for the last 2 years and is already projected toremain at this level for the next fiscal year, despite therising cost of research related to inflation in our economy[1]. As investigators, we must seek other funding opportu-nities to continue the acquisition of new knowledge at apace demanded by our patients.As clinical research funding becomes less of a priorityfor some governments, academic medical centers are morefrequently turning to private industry to sustain theircommitment to research. A recent survey of 122 majoracademic medical centers in the US revealed that 79% of allclinical trials were sponsored by private industry, and 76%of funding for clinical investigations came from private,for-profit companies [2]. The 4th Report of the HealthSelect Committee 2005 [3] reports that 75% of clinicaltrials reported in Lancet, the New England Journal ofMedicine,andtheJournal of the American MedicalAssociation are industry sponsored and that over 50% ofthese manuscripts may be ghost-written. It is unlikely thatthis trend of increasing industry-supported clinical researchwill reverse or even slow down.Medical school faculty, community physicians, hospitaladministrators, pharmaceutical and medical device compa-nies, and many other members of the health care commu-nity share a common, altruistic goal: we must provide thebest possible care for our patients. Few would disagree withthis assertion. Indeed, our dilemma arises from the otherresponsibilities that each of these entities maintains.These â€œother responsibilitiesâ€ are the source of ourconflicting interests that can lead to ethical problems thatundermine our common goal of quality patient care.Certainly, those with faculty appointments must be aca-demically productive. In the US, community physiciansmust meet realistic reimbursement goals to sustain the ever-increasing cost of operating a medical practice. Those whomanage and direct hospitals must demonstrate financialstability to hospital boards and investors. Pharmaceuticaland medical device companies are beholden to shareholders and board members.Clinical investigators, research sponsors, peer reviewers,institutional review boards, department chairmen, andjournal editors are charged to ensure that research isconducted, analyzed, and published in a safe, objectivefashion with full disclosure of all possible conflicts ofinterest. Furthermore, it is equally important that theseentities ensure registration and/or publication of trials thatshow no benefit of a particular medication or medicaldevice.In the US, the academic community and the pharmaceu-tical industry are exploring innovative ways to allow patientcare to remain the priority, while allowing each member ofthe research team to realize his or her own secondary goals.It is encouraging that the problems associated withindustry-sponsored research have recently gained attention",2006,International Urogynecology Journal
Form and Relation. Materialism on an Uncanny Stage,"This article seeks a materialism that is largely ignored in current philosophical discussion, which originates from speculation on the materiality of forms. Following the critique of Simondon and Heidegger, this article rejects hylomorphism which gives substantiality to forms rather than matter ; at the same time, this proposition also wants to distinguish itself from the current proposals of a return to matter, such as the vibrant matter of Jane Bennett or the principle of factuality of Quentin Meillassoux, by outlining a genealogy of the material conditions for the individuation of forms. The article endeavours to understand the evolution of the concept of form in different stages of technological development : crafts, machines, technological systems exemplified by the web. The article suggests that the materiality of form is not only thinkable, but also necessary for the development of a speculative metaphysics and critical theory of machines.",2014,Intellectica
Sparse Dynamic Filtering via Earth Mover's Distance Regularization,"Tracking time-varying signals is an important task for practical systems working with large discretized domains. Under such settings, sparsity-based approaches improve tracking accuracy since typically few targets appear in the scene (i.e. few locations in the discretized space are occupied). Discretization introduces a unique challenge: the traditional $\ell_{p}$ -norm dynamic constraints produce significant errors when there is even a small spatial mismatch between the predicted and true state. To overcome this, we present a tracking algorithm leveraging concepts from optimal transport, namely utilizing the earth-movers distance (EMD) as a dynamic regularizer to the $\ell_{1}$ -regularized inference problem (i.e., LASSO [1], or BPDN [2]). We extend the problem formulation to complex valued signals and modify the optimization program to reduce the computational burden. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in imaging and frequency tracking applications.",2018,"2018 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)"
Gravitational bounce,"SummaryA solution of Einsteinâ€™s field equations is derived which represents a thin spherical shell of charged dust falling in the spherically symmetric field of a charged massive body placed at its centre. Under suitable conditions the shell bounces reversibly at a nonzero minimal radius. A bounce is still possible even after the shell has collapsed inside the Schwarzschild sphere, so that the collapse as viewed externally is irreversible. The apparent paradox is explained in terms of the latticelike structure of the analytically extended Reissner-NordstrÃ¶m manifold. The possible relevance of the results to the problem of realistic gravitational collapse is discussed.RiassuntoSi deduce una soluzione delle equazioni del campo di Einstein che rappresenta un sottile strato sferico di polvere carica che cade nel campo a simmetria sferica di un corpo carico dotato di massa posto al centro. In opportune condizionilo strato rimbalza in modo reversibile a un raggio minimo non nullo. Ãˆ possibile un rimbalzo anche dopo che lo strato Ã¨ crollato entro la sfera di Schwarschild, cosicchÃ¨ il collasso visto dallâ€™esterno Ã¨ irreversibile. Si spiega lâ€™apparente paradosso per mezzo della struttura reticolare della molteplicitÃ  di Reissner-NordstrÃ¶m estesa analiticamente. Si discute la possibile influenza dei risultati sul problema del collasso gravitazionale realistico.Ð ÐµÐ·Ð¹Ð¼ÐµÐ’Ñ‹Ð²Ð¾Ð´Ð¸Ñ‚ÑÑ Ñ€ÐµÑˆÐµÐ½Ð¸Ðµ Ð¿Ð¾Ð»ÐµÐ²Ñ‹Ñ… ÑƒÑ€Ð°Ð²Ð½ÐµÐ½Ð¸Ð¹ Ð­Ð¹Ð½ÑˆÑ‚ÐµÐ¹Ð½Ð°, ÐºÐ¾Ñ‚Ð¾Ñ€Ð¾Ðµ Ð¿Ñ€ÐµÐ´ÑÑ‚Ð°Ð²Ð»ÑÐµÑ‚ Ñ‚Ð¾Ð½ÐºÐºÑƒÑŽ ÑÑ„ÐµÑ€Ð¸Ñ‡ÐµÑÐºÑƒÑŽ Ð¾Ð±Ð¾Ð»Ð¾Ñ‡ÐºÑƒ Ð·Ð°Ñ€Ñ‡Ð¶ÐµÐ½Ð½Ð¾Ð¹ Ð¿Ñ‹Ð»Ð¸, Ð¿Ð°Ð´Ð°ÑŽÑ‰ÐµÐ¹ Ð² Ñ†ÐµÐ½Ñ‚Ñ€Ð°Ð»ÑŒÐ½Ð¾-ÑÐ¸Ð¼Ð¼ÐµÑ‚Ñ€Ð¸Ñ‡Ð½Ð¾Ð¼ Ð¿Ð¾Ð»Ðµ Ð·Ð°Ñ€ÑÐ¶ÐµÐ½Ð½Ð¾Ð³Ð¾ Ð¼Ð°ÑÑÐ¸Ð²Ð½Ð¿Ð³Ð¾ Ñ‚ÐµÐ»Ð°, Ð¿Ð¾Ð¼ÐµÑ‰ÐµÐ½Ð½Ð¾Ð³Ð¾ Ð² Ñ†ÐµÐ½Ñ‚Ñ€Ðµ.

Asymmetric information in loan contracts: A game-theoretic and statistical approach,"In this work, we apply game-theoretic and statistical models to an open problem regarding asymmetric information in loan contracts. Under these asymmetries, the effect of higher collateral requirements on the interest rates applied by banks to borrowers is not clear. The literature has argued both for positive and a negative links, based on different hypotheses and econometric analyses. We discuss how this effect cannot be decided a-priori. In the first part we construct three game-theoretic models under different hypotheses, proving the impossibility of an univocal effect. Then, to assess what is the prevailing effect in the reality, we analyze for the first time loan big-data for millions of borrowers among various European countries, as collected by the European DataWarehouse. We examine some mathematical and practical aspects of: the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the Principal Component Regression (PCR), the regularization theory, the LASSO and RIDGE regressions, applying them to our datasets. Finally, we combine a regression model with the Probabilistic PCA, discussing the EM algorithm in presence of sparse datasets. These datasets are characteristic of our database and others, and defining the Probabilistic PCR we propose a new technique which may show itself useful if the availability of loan data will increase over time conserving some data sparsity.",2016,

The Oxford Handbook of the Italian Economy Since Unification,"This Oxford Handbook provides a fresh overall view and interpretation of the modern economic growth of one of the largest European countries, whose economic history is less known internationally than that of other comparably large and successful economies. It will provide, for the first time, a comprehensive, quantitative ""new economic history"" of Italy. The handbook offers an interpretation of the main successes and failures of the Italian economy at a macro level, the research--conducted by a large international team of scholars --contains entirely new quantitative results and interpretations, spanning the entire 150-year period since the unification of Italy, on a large number of issues.

Statistical validation of normal tissue complication probability models.,"PURPOSE
To investigate the applicability and value of double cross-validation and permutation tests as established statistical approaches in the validation of normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) models.


METHODS AND MATERIALS
A penalized regression method, LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator), was used to build NTCP models for xerostomia after radiation therapy treatment of head-and-neck cancer. Model assessment was based on the likelihood function and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.


RESULTS
Repeated double cross-validation showed the uncertainty and instability of the NTCP models and indicated that the statistical significance of model performance can be obtained by permutation testing.


CONCLUSION
Repeated double cross-validation and permutation tests are recommended to validate NTCP models before clinical use.",2012,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics"
Detecting multivariate interactions in spatial point patterns with Gibbs models and variable selection,"We propose a method for detecting significant interactions in very large multivariate spatial point patterns. This methodology develops high dimensional data understanding in the point process setting. The method is based on modelling the patterns using a flexible Gibbs point process model to directly characterise point-to-point interactions at different spatial scales. By using the Gibbs framework significant interactions can also be captured at small scales. Subsequently, the Gibbs point process is fitted using a pseudo-likelihood approximation, and we select significant interactions automatically using the group lasso penalty with this likelihood approximation. Thus we estimate the multivariate interactions stably even in this setting. We demonstrate the feasibility of the method with a simulation study and show its power by applying it to a large and complex rainforest plant population data set of 83 species.",2017,arXiv: Methodology
Constrained correspondence analysis for seriation of Sagalassos tablewares,"Reconstructing the time dimension is a crucial aspect of archaeological activity. Various methods are available based on a variety of scientific concepts. Often, correspondence analysis is used to obtain a seriation. However, the seriation solution does not produce explicit time frames, only a relative ordering. Furthermore, correspondence analysis ignores additional absolute dating information that may be available for some deposits. Also, correspondence analysis does not use criteria that logically restrict the order of the seriation. In this paper, we propose a constrained form of correspondence analysis that takes such restrictions into account. Using these constraints we are able to assign explicit dates to a seriated solution. We present a case-study that takes the 'Classical' methodology as a starting-point, and tests the established chronological framework of the Roman to early Byzantine tableware produced at Sagalassos against the application of constrained correspondence analysis. Interestingly, the results prove to be largely compatible.",2003,
A Study of Social Media Reviews Effects on the Success of Crowdfunding Projects,"Crowdfunding has become one of the important channels of getting fund for many start-ups. But, the low success rate has been a critical issue. Therefore, how to increase the success rate of fundraising projects is one of the main concerns of all fundraising activities. This work aims to study the effect of sentiment of reviews for the success of crowdfunding projects. We will use data mining and text mining to analyze the collected data. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and back-propagation networks (BPN) based feature selection will be employed to find the important factors for the success of crowdfunding projects. Next, support vector machines (SVM) will be employed to evaluate the performance of selected factors set. Experiment results can help fundraisers to increase the success rate of crowdfunding projects.",2019,2019 IEEE 10th International Conference on Awareness Science and Technology (iCAST)
Entire Regularization Path for Sparse Nonnegative Interaction Model,"Building sparse combinatorial model with non-negative constraint is essential in solving real-world problems such as in biology, in which the target response is often formulated by additive linear combination of features variables. This paper presents a solution to this problem by combining itemset mining with non-negative least squares. However, once incorporation of modern regularization is considered, then a naive solution requires to solve expensive enumeration problem many times for every regularization parameter. In this paper, we devise a regularization path tracking algorithm such that combinatorial feature is searched and included one by one to the solution set. Our contribution is a proposal of novel bounds specifically designed for the feature search problem. In synthetic dataset, the proposed method is demonstrated to run orders of magnitudes faster than a naive counterpart which does not employ tree pruning. We also empirically show that non-negativity constraints can reduce the number of active features much less than that of LASSO, leading to significant speed-ups in pattern search. In experiments using HIV-1 drug resistance dataset, the proposed method could successfully model the rapidly increasing drug resistance triggered by accumulation of mutations in HIV-1 genetic sequences. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of non-negativity constraints in suppressing false positive features, resulting in a model with smaller number of features and thereby improved interpretability.",2018,2018 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM)

Impact of ethanol blending into gasoline on aromatic compound evaporation and particle emissions from a gasoline direct injection engine,"Abstract This study examined the interactions of ethanol with aromatic compounds on aromatic species evolution during gasoline evaporation and the consequent impacts on particle emissions from a single-cylinder, gasoline direct injection engine. From a chemical kinetic standpoint, the dilution of the aromatic species in gasoline by ethanol blending should reduce particle emissions because aromatics are the primary species that form particles during gasoline combustion. However, increased evaporative cooling from the ethanol and ethanolâ€™s effect on when aromatics in the fuel droplet (or surface film or pool) evaporate can drive an increase in particle emissions. The objective of this study was to quantify these competing effects. The results show that a combination of ethanolâ€™s increased evaporative cooling and impact on aromatic compound vapor-liquid equilibrium can extend droplet lifetime and cause aromatics to evaporate later in the droplet evaporation process than would be the case without ethanol. When fuels were burned in a direct-injection single-cylinder engine at high speed (2500â€¯rpm) and relatively high load, ethanol blending caused an increase in particle emissions for fuels containing a low vapor pressure aromatic. At a lower speed (1500â€¯rpm), no statistically significant increase in particle emissions was observed, likely because more time was available for evaporation and mixing to occur. In contrast, particle emissions from a fuel blended with a high vapor pressure aromatic were either insensitive to or reduced by ethanol blending, likewise to engine operating conditions. Current models for predicting particle emissions from gasoline engines, such as particulate matter index (PMI), generally lack variables for non-linear interactions between ethanol and gasoline hydrocarbons. To identify nonlinear interactions between predictor variables that might better explain the observed particle emissions, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regularized regression approach was employed. Among the predictor variables evaluated was the Yield Sooting Index (YSI) which is as an improved measure to quantify the aromaticâ€™s chemical tendency to generate particle emissions. Following this analysis, two variables were selected based on their frequent appearance. The first was ethanol mole percent multiplied by aromatic mole percent divided by aromatic vapor pressure [(EtOH%â€¯*â€¯Aro%)/Aro VP@443â€¯K]. The second was aromatic mole percent multiplied by aromatic YSI divided by aromatic molecular weight [(Aro%â€¯*â€¯Aro YSI)/Aro MW]. The results of linear regression including only these two combined explanatory variables achieved an r2â€¯=â€¯0.959, substantially improved over the PMI model (r2â€¯=â€¯0.688) and provides insight into how the PMI formalism might be modified to account for non-linear oxygenate-hydrocarbon coupling.",2019,Applied Energy

Load-enhanced Movement Quality Screening and Tactical Athleticism: an Extension of Evidence.,"BACKGROUND
Military organizations use movement quality screening for prediction of injury risk and performance potential. Currently, evidence of an association between movement quality and performance is limited. Recent work has demonstrated that external loading strengthens the relationship between movement screens and performance outcomes. Such loading may therefore steer us toward robust implementations of movement quality screens while maintaining their appeal as cost effective, field-expedient tools.


PURPOSE
The purpose of the current study was to quantify the effect of external load-bearing on the relationship between clinically rated movement quality and tactical performance outcomes while addressing the noted limitations.


STUDY DESIGN
Crossover Trial.


METHODS
Fifty young adults (25 male, 25 female, 22.98â€‰Â±â€‰3.09 years, 171.95â€‰Â±â€‰11.46â€‰cm, 71.77â€‰Â±â€‰14.03â€‰kg) completed the Functional Movement Screenâ„¢ with (FMSâ„¢W) and without (FMSâ„¢C) a weight vest in randomized order. Following FMSâ„¢ testing, criterion measures of tactical performance were administered, including agility T-Tests, sprints, a 400-meter run, the Mobility for Battle (MOB) course, and a simulated casualty rescue. For each performance outcome, regression models were selected via group lasso with smoothed FMSâ„¢ item scores as candidate predictor variables.


RESULTS
For all outcomes, proportion of variance accounted for was greater in FMSâ„¢W (R2 = ;0.22 [T-Test], 0.29 [Sprint], 0.17 [400 meter], 0.29 [MOB], and 0.11 [casualty rescue]) than in FMSâ„¢C (R2 = ;0.00 [T-Test], 0.11 [Sprint], 0.00 [400 meter], 0.19 [MOB], and 0.00 [casualty rescue]). From the FMSâ„¢W condition, beneficial performance effects (p<0.05) were observed for Deep Squat (sprint, casualty rescue), Hurdle Step (T-Agility, 400 meter run), Inline Lunge (sprint, MOB), and Trunk Stability Push Up (all models). Similar effects for FMSâ„¢C item scores were limited to Trunk Stability Push Up (p<0.05, all models).


CONCLUSIONS
The present study extends evidence supporting the validity of load-enhanced movement quality screening as a predictor of tactical performance ability. Future designs should seek to identify mechanisms explaining this effect.

A new azhdarchoid pterosaur from the Cenomanian (Late Cretaceous) of Lebanon,"A new pterosaur, Microtuban altivolans gen. et sp. nov., is described from the Sannine Formation of northern Lebanon. The specimen is the first pterosaur from the Early Cenomanian (Late Cretaceous) locality of HjoÃ»la and is regarded as the most complete pterosaur fossil discovered from Africa. While postcranial characters indicate a possible relationship with members of the Thalassodromidae or Chaoyangopteridae, the specimen possesses an exceptionally short wing-finger phalanx 4, forming only 1.1% of the total length of the wing-finger. Its appearance along with an unnamed ornithocheiroid from the slightly younger locality of HÃ¢qel suggests that a number of pterosaur taxa existed within the local area, perhaps living on exposed carbonate platforms.",2011,Swiss Journal of Geosciences

Teaching a new trick to an old dog: Revisiting the quadratic programming formulation of sparse recovery using ADMM,"One of the early successful approaches to deal with the now classical â„“2 + â„“1 optimization formulation of sparse signal recovery (often known as the LASSO) was based on re-writing it as a bound-constrained quadratic program (BCQP), which was then tackled using a gradient projection (GP) algorithm with a spectral (Barzilai-Borwein) step choice. The resulting algorithm (called gradient projection for sparse reconstruction - GPSR) exhibited state-of-the-art speed when it was introduced, but now, 6 years later, much faster alternatives exist. In this paper, we revisit the BCQP formulation and show how it can be efficiently dealt with using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). We give preliminary experimental evidence that this approach is competitive with the current state-of-the-art, in a set of benchmark problems.",2014,"2014 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)"
Hybrid multivariate pattern analysis combined with extreme learning machine for Alzheimerâ€™s dementia diagnosis using multi-measure rs-fMRI spatial patterns,"BACKGROUND
Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is essential for timely treatment. Machine learning and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) for the diagnosis of brain disorders are explicitly attracting attention in the neuroimaging community. In this paper, we propose a voxel-wise discriminative framework applied to multi-measure resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) that integrates hybrid MVPA and extreme learning machine (ELM) for the automated discrimination of AD and MCI from the cognitive normal (CN) state.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
We used two rs-fMRI cohorts: the public Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative database (ADNI2) and an in-house Alzheimer's disease cohort from South Korea, both including individuals with AD, MCI, and normal controls. After extracting three-dimensional (3-D) patterns measuring regional coherence and functional connectivity during the resting state, we performed univariate statistical t-tests to generate a 3-D mask that retained only voxels showing significant changes. Given the initial univariate features, to enhance discriminative patterns, we implemented MVPA feature reduction using support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE), and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), in combination with the univariate t-test. Classifications were performed by an ELM, and its efficiency was compared to linear and nonlinear (radial basis function) SVMs.


RESULTS
The maximal accuracies achieved by the method in the ADNI2 cohort were 98.86% (p<0.001) and 98.57% (p<0.001) for AD and MCI vs. CN, respectively. In the in-house cohort, the same accuracies were 98.70% (p<0.001) and 94.16% (p<0.001).


CONCLUSION
From a clinical perspective, combining extreme learning machine and hybrid MVPA applied on concatenations of multiple rs-fMRI biomarkers can potentially assist the clinicians in AD and MCI diagnosis.",2019,PLoS ONE

Wideband DOA estimation from the sparse recovery perspective for the spatial-only modeling of array data,"This communication utilizes a sparse recovery technique named ''least absolute shrinkage and selection operator'' (LASSO) to formulate and solve the problem of direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation for far-field wideband sources. The spatial-only modeling for wideband array output is employed when the sources have flat spectra, and the DOA estimation problem in this model can be transformed into a sparse recovery problem. Via the LASSO technique, an optimization problem is constructed and solved by second-order cone (SOC) programming to obtain the DOA estimates. Numerical simulations are also provided in contrast with those existing algorithms using the spatial-only model.",2012,Signal Process.
Corexit 9500 Enhances Oil Biodegradation and Changes Active Bacterial Community Structure of Oil-Enriched Microcosms.,"To better understand the impacts of Corexit 9500 on the structure and activity levels of hydrocarbon-degrading microbial communities, we analyzed next-generation 16S rRNA gene sequencing libraries of hydrocarbon enrichments grown at 5 and 25Â°C using both DNA and RNA extracts as the sequencing templates. Oil biodegradation patterns in both 5 and 25Â°C enrichments were consistent with those reported in the literature (i.e., aliphatics were degraded faster than aromatics). Slight increases in biodegradation were observed in the presence of Corexit at both temperatures. Differences in community structure were observed between treatment conditions in the DNA-based libraries. The 25Â°C consortia were dominated by Vibrio, Idiomarina, Marinobacter, Alcanivorax, and Thalassospira species, while the 5Â°C consortia were dominated by several species of the genera Flavobacterium, Alcanivorax, and Oleispira Most of these genera have been linked to hydrocarbon degradation and have been observed after oil spills. Colwellia and Cycloclasticus, known aromatic degraders, were also found in these enrichments. The addition of Corexit did not have an effect on the active bacterial community structure of the 5Â°C consortia, while at 25Â°C, a decrease in the relative abundance of Marinobacter was observed. At 25Â°C, Thalassospira, Marinobacter, and Idiomarina were present at higher relative abundances in the RNA than DNA libraries, suggesting that they were active in degradation. Similarly, Oleispira was greatly stimulated by the addition of oil at 5Â°C.IMPORTANCE While dispersants such as Corexit 9500 can be used to treat oil spills, there is still debate on the effectiveness on enhancing oil biodegradation and its potential toxic effect on oil-degrading microbial communities. The results of this study provide some insights on the microbial dynamics of hydrocarbon-degrading bacterial populations in the presence of Corexit 9500. Operational taxonomic unit (OTU) analyses indicated that several OTUs were inhibited by the addition of Corexit. Conversely, a number of OTUs were stimulated by the addition of the dispersant, many of which were identified as known hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria. The results highlight the value of using RNA-based methods to further understand the impact of dispersant on the overall activity of different hydrocarbon-degrading bacterial groups.",2017,Applied and environmental microbiology
First principles molecular dynamics without self-consistent field optimization.,"We present a first principles molecular dynamics approach that is based on time-reversible extended Lagrangian Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics [A. M. N. Niklasson, Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 123004 (2008)] in the limit of vanishing self-consistent field optimization. The optimization-free dynamics keeps the computational cost to a minimum and typically provides molecular trajectories that closely follow the exact Born-Oppenheimer potential energy surface. Only one single diagonalization and Hamiltonian (or Fockian) construction are required in each integration time step. The proposed dynamics is derived for a general free-energy potential surface valid at finite electronic temperatures within hybrid density functional theory. Even in the event of irregular functional behavior that may cause a dynamical instability, the optimization-free limit represents a natural starting guess for force calculations that may require a more elaborate iterative electronic ground state optimization. Our optimization-free dynamics thus represents a flexible theoretical framework for a broad and general class of ab initio molecular dynamics simulations.",2014,The Journal of chemical physics
Triple the gamma -- A unifying shrinkage prior for variance and variable selection in sparse state space and TVP models,"Time-varying parameter (TVP) models are very flexible in capturing gradual changes in the effect of a predictor on the outcome variable. However, in particular when the number of predictors is large, there is a known risk of overfitting and poor predictive performance, since the effect of some predictors is constant over time. We propose a prior for variance shrinkage in TVP models, called triple gamma. The triple gamma prior encompasses a number of priors that have been suggested previously, such as the Bayesian lasso, the double gamma prior and the Horseshoe prior. We present the desirable properties of such a prior and its relationship to Bayesian Model Averaging for variance selection. The features of the triple gamma prior are then illustrated in the context of time varying parameter vector autoregressive models, both for simulated datasets and for a series of macroeconomics variables in the Euro Area.",2019,arXiv: Econometrics
"A Logical Methodology for Archaeoseismology: A Proof of Concept at the Archaeological Site of Sagalassos, Southwest Turkey","Archaeoseismology is currently controversial, with criticisms over the extent to which this research field can contribute to seismic-hazard analysis and, in- deed, as to whether man-made structures can be used as earthquake indicators at all. Addressing these concernsâ€”in other words, refining the utility of archaeologi- cally derived earthquake information to permit its inclusion in earthquake-hazard assessmentsâ€”requires first a systematic, quantitative, and interdisciplinary approach to the seismocultural record. Here, we modify a semiquantitative logic-tree formalism developed for palaeoseismology to explore a methodological scheme that can track uncertainties in successive stages of archaeoseismological investigation. The end result of our logic-tree formalism is a value that expresses the level of certainty to which an archaeological site has recorded a palaeoearthquake and thus reflects its relative significance with respect to a seismic-hazard analysis; we call this measure the archaeoseismic quality factor (AQF). We illustrate how the methodological scheme might work by applying it to Saga- lassos in southwest Turkey, an archaeological site for which earthquake effects are extensively reported. The resulting AQF that we derive from our critical review of the Sagalassos dataset is currently meaningless, because comparable values from equiva- lent reappraisals of earthquake evidence at other archaeological sites are needed for its relative significance to be appreciated. Nevertheless, the varying levels of uncertainty that we assign for different stages in the logic tree allow us to identify key weaknesses in the earthquake hypothesis at Sagalassos, deficiencies that might be redressed through future investigations onsite. The logic-tree formalism offers the potential of a standardized procedure to compile, categorize, and evaluate archaeoseismological information in a form that might, with refinement from wider earthquake archaeology studies, be appropriate for seismic-hazard analysis.",2008,Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America

Transmission Electron Microscopy of Mesozoic Terrestrial Microfossils,"From the evolutionary point of view the most important ultrastructural characteristic features of the terrestrial microfossils are presented in this contribution. During the Mesozoic Era important innovations happened in the ultrastructure of the gymnosperm pollen grains. The earliest saccate elements represent the alveolar infratectal ultrastructure, which appeared in the Carboniferous, and remains in the present day gymnosperm species (Pinus, Picea). New events during the Mesozoic: 1. Appearance of the modern ultrastructure type in several inaperturate and monosulcate pollen grains (Araucariacites Cookson, Cycadopites (Wodehouse) Wilson and Webster). 2. Exclusively Mesozoic gymnosperm types with peculiar LM morphology and exine ultrastructure. The pollen grains of the Operculati (Circulina Malyavkina, Classopollis Pflug, Classoidites Amerom) are very isolated by their LM morphology, the wall ultrastructure is very complicated, similar to some angiosperm taxa. 3. Angiosperm-like exine ultrastructure appeared at the LM morphologically gymnosperrn pollen grains of the Spheripollenites Couper fgen. 4. The gymnospermous Eucommiidites Erdtman has some angiosperm characteristics with the granular infratectal layer. Concerning the evolution of the vegetation the appearance of the angiosperms was the most important event. Regarding the ultrastructure of the pollen grains, the most important evolutionary alterations may be followed by the alterations in the ultrastructure of the infratectal layer.

Model Selection in the Analysis of Photoproduction Data,"Submitted for the APR17 Meeting of The American Physical Society Model Selection in the Analysis of Photoproduction Data JUSTIN LANDAY1, George Washington University â€” Scattering experiments provide one of the most powerful and useful tools for probing matter to better understand its fundamental properties governed by the strong interaction. As the spectroscopy of the excited states of nucleons enters a new era of precision ushered in by improved experiments at Jefferson Lab and other facilities around the world, traditional partialwave analysis methods must be adjusted accordingly. In this poster, we present a rigorous set of statistical tools and techniques that we implemented; most notably, the LASSO method, which serves for the selection of the simplest model, allowing us to avoid over fitting. In the case of establishing the spectrum of exited baryons, it avoids overpopulation of the spectrum and thus the occurrence of false-positives. This is a prerequisite to reliably compare theories like lattice QCD or quark models to experiments. Here, we demonstrate the principle by simultaneously fitting three observables in neutral pion photo-production, such as the differential cross section, beam asymmetry and target polarization across thousands of data points. 1Other authors include Michael Doring, Bin Hu, and Raquel Molina Justin Landay George Washington University Date submitted: 13 Sep 2016 Electronic form version 1.4",2017,Bulletin of the American Physical Society
Man(n) of the West(ern),"The critic ... is indeed concerned with evaluation, but to figure him as measuring with a norm which he brings up to the object and applies from the outside is to misrepresent the process. The Critic's aim is, first, to realize as sensitively and completely as possible this or that which claims his attention; and a certain valuing is implicit in the realizing. As he matures in experience of the new thing he asks, explicitly and implicitly: ""Where does this come? How does it stand in relation to ...? How relatively important does it seem?"" [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] --F.R. Leavis, The Common Pursuit Preliminary Man of the West is among the greatest Cinemascope movies of the 50s; others would include Bonjour Tristesse, The Tarnished Angels, Bigger Than Life and Rally 'Round the Flag, Boys! None of these is currently available on video, laserdisc or DVD in its correct format; the last two are not available at all. The copy from which I worked for this article is therefore missing approximately one third of Anthony Mann's magnificent film. I suppose I should be thankful that it appears to be an older video, made at the time when the video companies' solution to the problems of wide screen films was simply to lop off the sides: at least I can feel that I am seeing the middle two-thirds of the images Mann so meticulously and eloquently constructed, without the dubious benefits of 'pan & scan', the more technologically 'advanced' solution that substituted a worse barbarity for the earlier one, forcing the interested viewer to try to distinguish between the director's own camera movements and edits and those so thoughtfully added by generally insensitive video technicians. However, many complex shots in which different actions are taking place in different areas of the screen are ruined by this (the climactic showdown in Lassoo suffers especially), and many of the simpler shots are now misframed so that we see only half of characters' heads or bodies, depriving the film of the poised elegance that partly offsets or 'places' the multiple brutalities of the narrative. It is my opinion that such barbaric practices should be forbidden by law: consider the outcry there would be if the equivalent were perpetrated on a Rembrandt portrait or the score of a Beethoven symphony. It is a problem to which such committed and enlightened film restorers as Scorsese and Coppola might well devote their attention. Man of the West and Genre Around the cusp of the decade there appeared three films that must surely be included in any responsible list of the 'ten greatest' westerns: Man of the West (1958), Rio Bravo (1959) and The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962). Hawks's film can (in this context) be left to one side: it has all the trappings of a western but none of its essentials, as becomes clear if one juxtaposes it with its author's earlier Only Angels Have Wings and To Have and Have Not, either of which would be mistaken for a western but both of which share in detail Rio Bravo's thematic and narrative nucleus. Effectively, the other two, though sometimes categorized as 'revisionist', mark the end of the classical western, summing up and laying to rest its central concern with the taming of the wilderness in the interests of the growth of civilization. After The Man Who shot Liberty Valance, American civilization could no longer be celebrated or even, as in Ford's film, ambivalently and bleakly affirmed. The truly revisionist westerns are McCabe and Mrs. Miller and Heaven's Gate, both of which, in their very different ways, represent unambiguous denunciations of the 'progress' of American capitalism, refusing by reversing the terms of the classical western--a development already anticipated (though necessarily, for McCarey, in comic mode) in the wish-fulfillment fantasy of America's un-founding at the climax of Rally 'Round the Flag Boys! L'Auteur est Mort--Vive I'Auteur!' It was, I believe, Roland Barthes who, long ago (as it now feels), first proclaimed the 'Death of the Author'. â€¦",2013,
Faved! Biometrics: Tell Me Which Image You Like and I'll Tell You Who You Are,"This paper builds upon the belief that every human being has a built-in image aesthetic evaluation system. This sort of personal aesthetics mostly follows certain aesthetic rules widely studied in image aesthetics (e.g., rules of thirds, colorfulness, etc.), though it likely contains some innate, unique preferences. This paper is a proof of concept of this intuition, presenting personal aesthetics as a novel behavioral biometrical trait. In our scenario, personal aesthetics activate when an individual is presented with a set of photos he may like or dislike. The goal is to distill and encode the uniqueness of his visual preferences into a compact template. To this aim, we extract a pool of low- and high-level state-of-the-art image features from a set of Flickr images preferred by a user, feeding them successively into a LASSO regressor. LASSO highlights the most discriminant cues for the individual, allowing authentication and recognition tasks. The results are surprising given only 1 image as test. We can match the user identity against a gallery of 200 individuals definitely much better than chance. Using 20 images (all preferred by a single user) as a biometrical trait, we reach an AUC of 96%, considering the cumulative matching characteristic curve. Extensive experiments also support the interpretability of our approach, effectively modeling what is the â€œwhat we likeâ€ that distinguishes us from others.",2014,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security
"A new trematode, Allassogonoporus marginate, from the muskrat.","Forty-five trematodes were collected from the small intestine of a muskrat (Ondatra zibethica L.) trapped in the vicinity of Whitehall, Michigan. The specimens differ notably from all described species and cannot be included in any of the existing genera. The species is named Allassogonoporus marginalis n. g., n. sp. and is assigned tentatively to the family LECITHODENDRIIDAE. The first account of trematodes from the muskrat was made by Leidy (1888). He reported two species, one as Echinostomum echinatum Zeder and the other, of which he had only two specimens, as Amphistomum subtriquetrum Rud. Barker (1915) regarded the latter as Wardius zibethicus and listed nine species, seven of which were described briefly by himself and his associates. Price (1931) added four new species and a key. Recently Warwick (1936) tabulated all of the parasites that have been reported from the muskrat in Europe and North America. This list included twenty-one species of trematodes and, of these, Notocotylus quinquiserialis, Cladorchis subtriquetrus, and Fasciola hepatica have been collected in Europe. It is probable that certain species listed by Warwick, such as Fasciola hepatica and Paragonimus sp., are only occasional parasites in the muskrat. It is of interest to note that Ondatra zibethica L. is a North American species introduced into Europe.",1938,Journal of Parasitology
Lassoâ€™s Fleas: A Hungarian Connection for a European Topos,"This essay examines some of the humorous responses to fleas in literature, painting, and, especially, music. While scholarship has been aware of the wide-spread popularity of the flea-topos, no attention has yet been given to its musical manifestations. One of Lassoâ€™s two such compositions extends the geographic boundaries of the theme to remote Hungary. â€žBestia curvafia pulicesâ€ turns up in a poem that Lasso set to music and published in his Les melanges in 1576. â€žBestia curvafiaâ€ [whoreson beast] was an expression in Hungarian, which for centuries was one of the most common verbal abuses. The first registered occurrence of the defamation bestia curvafia is from 1507. It was known throughout the country. Both the presence of a Hungarian swearword in the title and the reference to a Hungarian town (Posonium) in the text prove the Hungarian origin of the text. â€“ Transcription of the chanson â€žBestia curvafiaâ€.",2000,
Effects of a sublethal concentration of sodium lauryl sulphate on the morphology and Na+/K+ ATPase activity in the gill of the ornate wrasse (Thalassoma pavo).,"We analysed the morphology and ultrastructure of the gill apparatus of the ornate wrasse, Thalassoma pavo, under normal conditions and after exposure to a sublethal concentration of sodium lauryl sulphate (3.5 mg/l, which is one-third of the 96LC99 value). To identify the biochemical mechanisms affected by this pollutant, we evaluated and compared the localisation of Na(+)/K(+) ATPase in normal and experimental conditions. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that this enzyme was active in the chloride cells (CCs), which were distributed in clusters in the interlamellar region of the filament. Ultrastructural analysis revealed conspicuous alterations on the epithelium after 96 and 192 h of exposure to sodium lauryl sulphate: structural features of the surface cells were lost, the appearance of intercellular lacunae changed, and cellular degeneration occurred. Statistical analysis comparing the number and dimensions of CCs in normal conditions and after 96 h of exposure showed that the CC area decreased after exposure to the detergent.",2008,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety
Robust linear estimation using M-estimation and weighted L1 regularization: Model selection and recursive implementation,"This paper studies an M-estimation-based method for linear estimation with weighted L1 regularization and its recursive implementation. Motivated by the sensitivity of conventional least-squares-based L1-regularized linear estimation (Lasso) in impulsive noise environment, an M-estimator-based Lasso (M-Lasso) method is introduced to restrain the outliers and an iterative re-weighted least-squares (IRLS) algorithm is proposed to solve this M-estimation problem. Moreover, instead of using the matrix inversion formula, QR decomposition (QRD) is employed in the M-Lasso for recursive implementation with a lower arithmetic complexity. Simulation results show that the M-estimation-based Lasso performs considerably better than the traditional LS-based Lasso in suppressing the impulsive noise, and its recursive QRD algorithm has a good performance in online processing.",2009,2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems
Mestre e Oviedo: due sistemi di triage a confronto,"A partire dagli anni Novanta si sono sviluppati dei sistemi di triage intraospedaliero, in particolar modo in quattro realta internazionali: Australia, Canada, Stati Uniti e Regno Unito. Tali sistemi sono divenuti dei modelli di riferimento anche per i Pronto Soccorsi di alcuni Stati. Altri, invece, come lâ€™Italia, utilizzano una grande vastita di sistemi per lo piu adattati alle realta locali. 
Obiettivo. Il presente studio si prefigge di confrontare due sistemi di triage: uno internazionale, il Manchester Triage System, in uso nel Pronto Soccorso di Oviedo e uno costruito ad hoc, utilizzato nellâ€™Ospedale dellâ€™Angelo di Mestre. 
Materiali e metodi. Oltre allâ€™analisi descrittiva dei due sistemi in questione, ci si e avvalsi di una raccolta dati retrospettiva in merito ad un campione di 100 pazienti per ciascun ospedale. Lâ€™intento e di misurare lâ€™attesa media in minuti (totale e riferita ad ogni codice) del lasso di tempo che intercorre tra lâ€™effettuazione del triage e il contatto medico-paziente. Si vuole verificare se i risultati ottenuti corrispondano agli standard previsti dai corrispettivi sistemi. 
Risultati. Dallâ€™analisi descrittiva si evince che i due campioni, similari per bacino dâ€™utenza, presentano delle differenze per le seguenti caratteristiche, definenti il sistema e lâ€™esecuzione del triage: accesso del paziente, locale predisposto al triage, modello in uso, attuazione del triage, numero e tipologia dei codici di priorita, tempistiche massime previste per ogni codice, esistenza di ulteriori codici o percorsi preferenziali. Dallâ€™analisi dei dati emerge che Mestre rispetta per lo piu i tempi previsti dai range, mentre Oviedo presenta tempistiche ottimali per tutti i codici ad eccezione del livello 2. 
Conclusioni. Non si puo affermare la superiorita di un sistema rispetto ad un altro, in assenza di un gold standard di riferimento e della necessita condivisa di effettuare ulteriori studi in materia. Tuttavia, rispetto allâ€™obiettivo prefissato, il confronto e stato possibile in riferimento ad alcuni punti cardine dei sistemi.",2015,
Screening of heritage data for improving toughness of creep-resistant martensitic steels,"Abstract Data science techniques were used to quantify the effect of alloying additions on the tensile behavior of martensitic steels. The effort was undertaken to exploit the heritage data to establish the next experimental design space for the class of 9â€“12â€¯wt% Cr steels for the application of turbine rotors with an operating temperature of 650 âˆ˜ C and above. Linear, lasso, and multivariate multiple regression models were utilized to identify which alloying elements contribute towards strength and ductility. Visualization techniques such as t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding and pair-wire element specific comparisons were utilized to explore information gaps that exist within the data. The study found that tantalum, recently added to improve the creep rupture lifetime, does not show any effect on tensile properties. All combined, the results suggest that the low tempering temperature has compensated for the low alloying additions in the past, therefore, new experiments are needed to isolate the effects of tempering temperature from those of individual elements.",2019,Materials Science and Engineering A-structural Materials Properties Microstructure and Processing

Seawater turbidity and fish communities on coral reefs of Puerto Rico,"We investigated the variations of reef fish assemblages on coral reefs that experience different turbidity regimes, by assessing the association between the vertical extinction coefficient for photosynthetically active radiation (K d PAR ) and communities of fishes and corals at 21 reef sites in La Parguera, southwest Puerto Rico. Statistical correlations and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS) identified turbidity as an important environmental parameter affecting ecological processes on coral reefs, as reflected by changes in the composition and abundance of reef fishes and benthic communities. Lower fish density and species richness was found at turbid sites. Turbidity was also negatively correlated to percent coral cover, which together with rugosity, were additional habitat parameters shaping reef fish assemblages. Bluehead wrasse Thalassoma bifasciatum and yellowtail damselfish Microspathodon chrysurus were species rarely present at turbid sites and abundant at clear ones. The yellowtail hamlet Hypoplectrus chlorurus and sharknose goby Elacatinus evelynae had the opposite distribution along the turbidity gradient. We identified seawater turbidity as an additional predictor of the reef fish community structure in La Parguera, in addition to live coral cover and reef rugosity. Because coral reefs and reef fishes were less complex (lower rugosity, less species richness, less diversity) in more turbid sites, managing for clear water conditions within the coastal area of La Parguera should lead to improved ecosystem resilience and stability, and should become a primary goal of management.",2013,Marine Ecology Progress Series
The surgical resectability following neoadjuvant therapy in pancreatic head cancer,"s / Pancreatology 526 Objectives. Alcohol is a risk factor for acute pancreatitis. In our previous two year follow up abstinence protected for recurrences. Our aim was to further determine recurrence of pancreatitis and later pancreatic function in patients who quit drinking after the first episode of alcoholassociated pancreatitis. Materials andmethods: Out of the total of 120 patients with their first alcohol-associated pancreatitis, 23 (20 M, 3 F; age median 47 (27â€“60) years) met the inclusion criteria for abstinence during the follow up. The criteria for abstinence were alcohol consumption less than 24 grams per twomonths (self-estimated) which is in line with questionnaires detecting alcohol consumption and dependency (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, AUDIT < 8 and Short Alcohol Dependence Data, SADD < 9). Recurrent attacks of acute pancreatitis were studied. Smoking, body-mass index and laboratory tests detecting heavy use of alcohol were recorded. Blood and fecal tests were studied to assess endocrine and exocrine pancreatic function. Results: During a mean follow up time of 4.8 (2â€“9) years and total of 111 patient years therewere no recurrent attacks of acute pancreatitis. Two patients had diabetes prior to and two just after the first episode of acute pancreatitis. One patient demonstrated new onset diabetes during the follow up at 1.5 years. One patient showed low elastase activity at 2 and another at 3 years, but no-one later on. Conclusions: Abstinence after the first acute alcohol-associated pancreatitis protects from recurrent attacks and seems to decrease the risk for pancreatic dysfunction.",2012,Pancreatology
Input variables selection criteria for data-driven Soft Sensors design,"In this paper the design of a Soft Sensor to estimate the sulphur concentration in a desulphuring unit of a refinery operating in Sicily is described. In particular the problem of the input variables selection is addressed by comparing two different methods. The first method is based on the generalization of the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) algorithm to nonlinear models implemented by using Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks. The second one is based on the Lipschitz's quotient analysis. A comparison between the performance and the computational complexity exhibited by the two methods is discussed. The results show that the LASSO-MLP algorithm allows to construct a model with a low number of input variables, thus reducing computational complexity and measuring costs.",2017,"2017 IEEE 14th International Conference on Networking, Sensing and Control (ICNSC)"

"Comparative Efficacy Study of IL-15 Transfections in Various Mouse Cancer Cells (RM-1 Prostate Cancer, B16 Melanoma, and 4T1 Breast Cancer)","Results Introduction Cancer is a major cause of morbidity and mortality around the world. Despite surgical techniques, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and biological therapy, approximately 50% of all cancer patients will die from their disease. In addition, it is estimated that more than one million Americans will develop cancer every year (1). Due to the high diagnosis and death rates new prevention and treatment regimens are needed. One such solution is the development of cancer vaccines. Early stages of the vaccine development in mice involved the treatment of B16 cancer cells with interferon-Î± (IFN-Î±) in vitro for one week (2). When lethally irradiated B16Î± cells were injected into mice, without an adjuvant, immunity developed to the parental tumor cells (2). The immunity required CD4 helper T cells, macrophages, CD8 cells, and Natural Killer cells (3). In addition, there was a profound activation of lymphocytes that persisted for weeks after vaccination (4). IL-15 induction by IFN-Î± was found to be associated with the vaccine efficacy (4). To discover whether IL-15 was inducing the immunity, a specific interfering RNA for IL-15 (siRNA-IL-15) was cloned into a vector, blocking the accumulation of cell-associated IL-15 (Unpublished observation). As a control, a scrambled RNA sequence (scrRNA) with no known activity was also cloned into a vector. The two vectors were then separately cloned into B16 cells and treated with IFN-Î±, producing B16Î± cells. Vaccination with B16Î± and B16Î±-scrRNA cells showed similar immunity. However B16Î±-siRNA cells did not induce immunity, demonstrating that the depletion of IL-15 eliminates the vaccine efficacy of B16Î± cells (4). Although the vaccine protocol worked in mice, the IFN-Î± treatment was very expensive. Furthermore, IFN-Î± treatment of human cells did not give high levels of IL-15. Thus, another avenue was explored, leading to the transfection of B16 cells with the IL-15 genes. In doing this an important question was asked; was the IL-15 secretable or non-secretable? To answer this question, originally two splice variants were used; IL-15 with a long peptide leader sequence (IL-15 LSP) and IL-15 with a short peptide leader sequence (IL-15 SSP). According to the literature (3), the IL-15 LSP produces IL-15 which is secreted from the cell, whereas IL-15 SSP produces IL-15 which accumulates in the cell. Through Real-Time RT PCR and ELISAs studies, it was determined that no secreted IL-15 could be detected in cultures of B16 cells transfected with IL-15 LSP. A high level of cellassociated IL-15 was detected in B16 cells transfected with IL-15 SSP. However, when this work was extended to other cancer lines such as RM-1 prostate cancer and 4T1 breast cancer, it was found that there was downregulation of the IL-15 genes in these cancer cell lines. An IL-15 genetic variant containing a very short peptide leader sequence (IL-15 VSSP) was developed to try to produce higher levels of cellassociated IL-15. RM-1, B16, and 4T1 cells were transfected with the various IL-15 genetic constructs (IL-15 LSP, IL-15 SSP, and IL-15 VSSP) and monitored for IL-15 production. B16 cells transfected with the various IL-15 genetic constructs were evaluated for vaccine efficacy. .",2009,
Radiomics analysis potentially reduces over-diagnosis of prostate cancer with PSA levels of 4-10 ng/ml based on DWI data,"Prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening is routinely conducted for suspected prostate cancer (PCa) patients. As this technique might result in high probability of over-diagnosis and unnecessary prostate biopsies, controversies on it remains especially for patients with â€œgray-zoneâ€ PSA levels, i.e. 4-10ng/ml. To improve the risk stratification of suspected PCa patients, Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System version 2 (PI-RADSv2) was released in 2015. Although PI-RADSv2 showed good performance in the detection of PCa, its specificity was relatively low for patients with gray-zone PSA levels. This indicated that over-diagnosis issue could not be dealt well by PI-RADSv2 in the gray zone. Addressing this, we attempted to validate whether radiomics analysis of Diffusion weighted Imaging (DWI) data could reduce over-diagnosis of PCa with gray-zone PSA levels. Here, 140 suspected PCa patients in Peking Union Medical College Hospital were enrolled. 700 radiomic features were extracted from the DWI data. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) were conducted, and 7 radiomic features were selected on the training set (n=93). Based on these features, random forest classifier was used to build the Radiomics model, which performed better than PI-RADSv2 (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.900 vs 0.773 and 0.844 vs 0.690 on the training and test sets). Furthermore, the specificity values of Radiomics model and PI-RADSv2 was 0.815 and 0.481 on the test set, respectively. In conclusion, radiomics analysis of DWI data might reduce the over-diagnosis of PCa with gray-zone PSA levels.",2019,

Baum, B. Classon, M. Cudak, S. Ramachadran, P. Sartori, E. Visotsky Motorola Introduction The introduction of relaying for IEEE802.16 can ser ve several purposes, such as range extension, gap f illing, and increased data rates near the edge of a cell. As explained in [1] and [2], relaying is especially beneficial for the uplink, since a SS transmits at a much lower po wer level than a BS. Because of this power differe nce, the downlink is often interference-limited while the up link is often thermal-noise-limited even for a reas onable cell radius (e.g., 2 km). Therefore, although the stand ard must in general be capable of supporting relayi ng on both the downlink and uplink, there is significant value in including support for a simplified uplink-only relaying mode as well. The main purpose of this contributio n is to propose a simplified uplink-only relaying m ode for inclusion in the overall 802.16j standard. In this simplified mode, downlink transmissions are not re lay d at all, which can significantly reduce the complexity of th e relay station, reduce downlink overhead, and simp lify route management and handoff. The solution presented here has the following advan tages: 1. The uplink-only RS (U-RS) is a simplified unit that only needs to perform a few layer-one operations and a minimal set of layer-two tasks. 2. One or more U-RS can be deployed in each sector. A particular U-RS does not need to be aware of other U-RS. 3. The BS always remains in control of the transmissio n, thereby resulting in increased transmission reliability. 4. The architecture still permits hybrid-ARQ (HARQ) to be performed on the uplink. As a side benefit, the signaling and route selectio n methods developed for the uplink-only relaying mo de may also be used as part of the full two-way relaying m ode. In particular, for a two-way relaying scheme that chooses uplink and downlink routes independently, t he uplink-only mode described here can be used for managing the uplink part of the relaying. Moreover , if a two-way relay is deployed where downlink rel aying would not be particularly helpful, it should be pos sible to completely turn off the downlink relaying portion of the relay and have it act as an uplink-only relay. General Description The disparity in PA power between SS and BS suggest s tha a solution can be tailored to provide the ne cessary assistance to the uplink while not being involved i n the downlink. As a result, cost efficiencies can be achieved by creating a subordinate relationship between rela ys and the BS allowing the RS to be low cost while ensuring robust reliable transmission supervised by a centra l authority. The cost efficiencies may be realized by reducing RS complexity such that it only focuses on layer-on e perations and a minimal set of layer-two tasks. System Configuration and Operation Figure 1 depicts the possible communication pathway s between BSs, SS, and U-RS. Figure 1a) shows the typical communication paths in a cellular system wi th the U-RS disabled. A BS coordinates the resource s in the cell by distributing control information and arbitr a ing access requests. In addition, the BS transmit s data directly to the SS and receives data directly from an SS. Figure 1b) shows the communication paths wit h the URS enabled. In this case, the BS still coordinates resources in the cell by distributing control infor mation and arbitrating access requests. Additionally, the BS c ontinues to transmit data directly to the SS. Howev er, the 2006-11-08 IEEE C802.16j-06_160_r1 2 uplink data from the SS follows a triangular path f irst being received and detected by the U-RS then r e-encoded and transmitted to the BS by the U-RS. Figure 1 c) and d) show two variations on the U-RS configuratio n. Figure 1c) shows multiple active U-RS simultaneousl y repeating the SS data to the BS. Figure 1d) shows the simultaneous co-existence of a relayed and non-rela yed uplink communication. In accordance with the 80 2.16j requirements, the SS is completely unaware of the e xistence of a relay within in the system. Note tha t in Figure 1, and throughout this contribution, another intermediate RS may play the role of the BS. U-RS BS SS control data data U-RS BS SS control data",2006,
"Prokaryotic diversity in Tuz Lake, a hypersaline environment in Inland Turkey.","Tuz Lake is an inland thalassohaline water body located in central Anatolia that contributes to 60% of the total salt production in Turkey per year. The microbiota inhabiting this lake has been studied by FISH, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of PCR-amplified fragments of 16S rRNA genes, and 16S rRNA gene clone library analysis. Total cell counts per milliliter (1.38 x 10(7)) were in the range of the values normally found for hypersaline environments. The proportion of Bacteria to Archaea in the community detectable by FISH was one to three. 16S rRNA gene clone libraries indicated that the archaeal assemblage was dominated by members of the Square Haloarchaea of the Walsby group, although some other groups were also found. Bacteria were dominated by members of the Bacteroidetes, including Salinibacter ruber-related phylotypes. Because members of Bacteroidetes are widely present in different hypersaline environments, a phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences from Bacteroidetes retrieved from these environments was carried out in order to ascertain whether they formed a unique cluster. Sequences retrieved from Tuz Lake and a group of sequences from other hypersaline environments clustered together in a branch that could be considered as the 'halophilic branch' within the Bacteroidetes phylum.",2008,FEMS microbiology ecology

Zhao and Yu [(2006) J. Machine Learning Research 7 2541-2567] formalized the neighborhood stability condition in the context of linear regression as a strong irrepresentable condition. That paper showed that under this condition, the LASSO selects exactly the set of nonzero regression coefficients, provided that these coefficients are bounded away from zero at a certain rate. In this paper, the regression coefficients outside an ideal model are assumed to be small, but not necessarily zero. Under a sparse Riesz condition on the correlation of design variables, we prove that the LASSO selects a model of the correct order of dimensionality, controls the bias of the selected model at a level determined by the contributions of small regression coefficients and threshold bias, and selects all coefficients of greater order than the bias of the selected model. Moreover, as a consequence of this rate consistency of the LASSO in model selection, it is proved that the sum of error squares for the mean response and the l Î± -loss for the regression coefficients converge at the best possible rates under the given conditions. An interesting aspect of our results is that the logarithm of the number of variables can be of the same order as the sample size for certain random dependent designs.",2008,Annals of Statistics
P1048: Increased amount of reported total sleep time during 24 hours is related to the severity of sleep disturbances in ischemic stroke patients,"s of Poster Presentations / Clinical Neurophysiology 125, Supplement 1 (2014) S1â€“S339 S327 P1046 Data-driven modeling of sleep EEG and EOG reveals stages indicative of pre-Parkinson and Parkinsonâ€™s disease J.A.E.

Lundbeck A/S, Clinical Pharmacology, Valby, Denmark; 5University of Copenhagen, Center for Healthy Ageing, Copenhagen, Denmark Question: Will unsupervised modelling of sleep EOG and sleep EEG reveal sleep characteristica indicative of pre-Parkinson and Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD)? Methods: Polysomnographic (PSG) data from 10 age-matched control subjects were used to develop an EOG sleep model and an EEG sleep model. The sleep models were applied on full-night PSG data from 24 additional control subjects, 26 patients with periodic leg movements (PLM), 31 patients with idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) and 36 PD patients. Based on the data-driven sleep models, features reflecting sleep characteristics in the EEG and EOG activity were computed. The total amount of data was devided in a training dataset containing 16 subjects from each of the four groups, and a validation dataset containing the remaining subjects. The features derived were evaluated and the most discriminative ones between iRBD/PD (neurodegenerative diseases (NDD) cases) and PLM/controls (motor, but non-NDD cases) were found by training a Lasso regularized Regression model using eight-fold cross-validation on the training dataset. Results: The best classification model included four features derived from the EEG data, and the NDD patients in the validation dataset could be classified with a sensitivity of 91.4% and a specificity of 61.1%. The most discriminative features were found to be thresholded amounts and stability of EEG topics reflected to REM, N3 and N1/N2, respectively. Conclusions: This study suggests that the amount of N3 and R and the ability to maintain NREM and REM sleep determined by a data-driven sleep model can be used as potentially early PD biomarkers.

Leskelae2, E. Rauhala1 1Satakunta Central Hospital, Clinical Neurophysiology, Pori, Finland; 2Satakunta Central Hospital, Neurology, Pori, Finland Question: Are self-reported short and long term sleep quality related to the severity of sleep related breathing disturbances (SRBD) in ischemic stroke patients? Methods: In this pilot study, 23 patients with acute first-time stroke, admitted to the stroke unit, underwent overnight polygraphy during the first 72 h after admission. Nasal airflow, respiratory movements, snoring sound, oxygenation level, and ECG were recorded. The incidence of SRBD before the stroke was studied with a questionnaire regarding their sleep three months prior the stroke. The reported quality of sleep during the treatment period in stroke unit was examined with the visual scale questionnaire containing five questions. The severity of stroke was assessed with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and the ability to function with the Barthel Index. Results: Increased apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) was related to the increased amount of total sleep time during 24 hours (p=0.006). No association was found between AHI and the amount of sleep time during night. Also, no correlations between AHI and VAS questions were found. Increased AHI was related with lower Barthel Index (p=0.017) but not with NIHSS. Conclusions: SRBD as well as excessive daytime sleepiness are common findings in patients after stroke. In our study, stroke patients with increased AHI reported increased amount of sleep time during 24 h but not during night time regarding three months pre-stroke, suggesting that they are napping. SRBD negatively affect to the functional outcome after stroke. In addition, SRBD increases the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases, which in turn increases risk for stroke. It is suggested that early diagnosis and treatment of underlying SRBD improve both recovery from stroke in short term and reduce the risk of relapses in long term. Our preliminary results suggest that reported napping may be a marker for a potential SRBD in stroke patients. P1049 Non-REM sleep microstructures and phasic REM sleep events are associated with intracranial oxygenation changes measured with NIRS J. Toppila1, T. Naesi2, J. Virtanen2, T. Salmi1, R. Ilmoniemi2 1Helsinki University Hospital, Medical Imaging/Clin. Neurophys., Helsinki, Finland; 2Aalto University, BECS, Espoo, Finland Question: Disordered and fragmented sleep due to sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, and insomnia are associated with an increased risk of cardioand cerebrovascular morbidity. Autonomic activation and repetitive hypoxia are examples of possible mechanisms mediating this risk. In addition to sleep apnea episodes, non-apneic disruptions in sleep continuity are associated with transitory intracranial hypoxia measured with nearinfrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Some of the K-complexes are triggered by non-waking external auditory stimuli. Phasic rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep is associated with the activation of the autonomic nervous system and surges in systemic blood pressure. Are these sleep microstructural phenomena associated with changes in intracranial blood oxygenation? Methods: Six healthy volunteers were measured overnight with polysomnography and NIRS for extraand intracranial blood oxygenation changes. Sleep spindles, K-complexes, and bursts of eye movements in REM sleep were detected. Average temporal changes in oxyand deoxyhemoglobin triggered by these sleep events were measured. Results: K-complexes triggered short intracranial hemodynamic responses and spindels delayed and longer responses. During and after phasic events in REM sleep, there were transient changes in intracranial blood oxygenation. Conclusions: K-complexes are associated with transient hemodynamic changes in intracranial circulation, which can mediate harmful vascular effects during poor sleep due to noisy environments. Systemic blood pressure surges during phasic REM sleep are counteracted with vasoconstriction in cerebral arteries, leading to transient cerebral hypoperfusion and hypoxia episodes during REM sleep. This could be associated with an increased risk of stroke during early mornings. P1050 Neurophysiological testing of the upper airway in obstructive sleep apnea showing peripheral nervous lesions E.

Tectonic types of the Pacific abyssal basins,"This paper continues a series of publications on tectonics, structural evolution, and formation mechanism of abyssal basins. The Pacific abyssal basins of the Western thalassogen are subdivided into three types: intermontane, interfault, and syneclise-type. The new term thalassosyneclise is proposed for the third type. Basins of the first, second, and third types are developed in the western, northeastern, and southern Pacific, respectively. The main mechanism responsible for the formation of basins belonging to the first two types is a stepwise subsidence of the oceanic bottom. The formation of a thalassosyneclise abyssal basin is probably related to energy flux of the South Pacific plume.",2006,Geotectonics
Sparse reconstruction by separable approximation,"Finding sparse approximate solutions to large underdetermined linear systems of equations is a common problem in signal/image processing and statistics. Basis pursuit, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), wavelet-based deconvolution and reconstruction, and compressed sensing (CS) are a few well-known areas in which problems of this type appear. One standard approach is to minimize an objective function that includes a quadratic (lscr 2) error term added to a sparsity-inducing (usually lscr1) regularizater. We present an algorithmic framework for the more general problem of minimizing the sum of a smooth convex function and a nonsmooth, possibly nonconvex regularizer. We propose iterative methods in which each step is obtained by solving an optimization subproblem involving a quadratic term with diagonal Hessian (i.e., separable in the unknowns) plus the original sparsity-inducing regularizer; our approach is suitable for cases in which this subproblem can be solved much more rapidly than the original problem. Under mild conditions (namely convexity of the regularizer), we prove convergence of the proposed iterative algorithm to a minimum of the objective function. In addition to solving the standard lscr2-lscr1 case, our framework yields efficient solution techniques for other regularizers, such as an lscrinfin norm and group-separable regularizers. It also generalizes immediately to the case in which the data is complex rather than real. Experiments with CS problems show that our approach is competitive with the fastest known methods for the standard lscr2-lscr1 problem, as well as being efficient on problems with other separable regularization terms.",2009,IEEE Trans.

oXPDL : a Process Model Exchange Ontology,"This paper presents oXPDL, a process interchange ontology based on the standardised XML Process Definition Language (XPDL). XPDL was introduced to exchange process models between todayâ€™s information systems which still mostly use proprietary workflow models. However, XPDL lacks the representational strength to semantically define extensions which vendors can add to the schema of XPDL. It is shallow on the modelling of the informational and organisational aspect and it lacks the ability to interlink to existing standardised knowledge bases. oXPDL explicitly models the complete semantics of a process model defined according to XPDL in a Web ontology language. It has a strong focus on the reuse and integration of other existing standard ontologies such as SUMO, eClassOWL, RosettaNet and PSL. Further, a tool is presented to automatically translate an XML instance according to the XPDL schema to an instance according to oXPDL.

Intelligent Sparse Representations for Speech âˆ—,"We design a dictionary in which speech signals have a sparse representation. We utilize the property that speech is comprised of a fixed number of phonemes. The dictionary is a concatenation of the principal components of all these phonemes, and hence information about each phoneme is present in a block. Since any speech signal is a concatenation of phonemes, it can be represented as a linear combination of the columns of this dictionary. In particular, if we consider a small window of speech (containing no more than two phonemes), such a signal would ideally have a block sparse representation in the dictionary. The representation is obtained by solving a variation of the LASSO or basis pursuit denoising (BPDN) problem. We show that the representation is sparse enough to achieve compression. Finally, our intuition is that such a representation could also implicitly perform denoising.",2015,

Effect of Light-Emitting Diode Irradiation on Chronic Nonhealed Wound After Below-Knee Amputation.,"Chronic nonhealed wound after below-knee amputation is a serious problem that is faced by the health care team; therefore, there is a need to find an adjuvant therapy to address this problem. The aim of the study is to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of light-emitting diode (LED) irradiation on chronic nonhealed wound after below-knee amputation using a digitalized method of evaluation by Adobe Photoshop CS5 aided by magnetic lasso tool. Thirty patients with chronic nonhealed wound (â‰¥4 weeks) after below-knee amputation were randomly divided into 2 equal groups, with 15 participants in each. Group A received the LED irradiation for 24 sessions (3 sessions per week) in addition to the standard medical treatment, and the second experimental group (group B) received the standard medical treatment for 8 weeks. Methods of evaluation included the wound surface area: for tracing the wound perimeter using a computerized software. Results showed that both LED irradiation therapy and standard medical treatment were effective in healing the chronic nonhealed wound, but the LED was more effective than standard medical treatment alone. A clear improvement in the results of wound healing surface area was found in group A, with an improvement percentage of 50.63%, when compared with group B, which used the standard medical treatment alone, with an improvement percentage of 43.96%.",2020,The international journal of lower extremity wounds
[A new method of sparse feature extraction for stellar spectra].,"The authors propose a novel method of feature extraction for stellar spectra parameterization. The basic procedures are: First, stellar spectra are decomposed by multi-scale Harr wavelet and the coefficients with high-frequency are rejected. Secondly, the optimal features are detected by the lasso algorithm. Finally, we input the optimal feature vector to non-parametric regression model to estimate the atmospheric parameters. Haar wavelet can remove the high-frequency noise from the stellar spectrum. Lasso algorithm can further compress data by analyzing their significance on parameterization and removing redundancy. Experiments show that the proposed Haar+lasso method improves the accuracy and efficiency of the estimation. The authors used this scheme to estimate the atmospheric parameters from a subsample of some 40,000 stellar spectra from SDSS. The accuracies of our predictions (mean absolute errors) for each parameter are 0.0071 dex for log Teff, 0.2252 dex for log g, and 0.1996 dex for [Fe/H]. Compared with the results of the existing literature, this scheme can derive more accurate atmospheric parameters.",2014,Guang pu xue yu guang pu fen xi = Guang pu
In silico analysis of long non-coding RNAs in medulloblastoma and its subgroups,"Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant pediatric brain tumor with high fatality rate. Recent large-scale studies utilizing genome-wide technologies have sub-grouped medulloblastomas into four major subgroups: wingless (WNT), sonic hedgehog (SHH), group 3, and group 4. However, there has yet to be a global analysis of long non-coding RNAs, a crucial part of the regulatory transcriptome, in medulloblastoma. Here, we performed bioinformatic analysis of RNA-seq data from 175 medulloblastoma patients. Differential lncRNA expression sub-grouped medulloblastomas into the four main molecular subgroups. Some of these lncRNAs were subgroup-specific, with a random forest-based machine-learning algorithm identifying an 11-lncRNA diagnostic signature. We also validated the diagnostic signature in patient derived xenograft (PDX) models. We further identified a 17-lncRNA prognostic model using LASSO based penalized Cox' PH model (Score HRâ€¯=â€¯13.6301, 95% CIâ€¯=â€¯8.857-20.98, logrank p-valueâ€¯â‰¤â€¯2e-16). Our analysis represents the first global lncRNA analysis in medulloblastoma. Our results identify putative candidate lncRNAs that could be evaluated for their functional role in medulloblastoma genesis and progression or as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers.",2020,Neurobiology of disease
Development of a multicomponent prediction model for acute esophagitis in lung cancer patients receiving chemoradiotherapy.,"PURPOSE
To construct a model for the prediction of acute esophagitis in lung cancer patients receiving chemoradiotherapy by combining clinical data, treatment parameters, and genotyping profile.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
Data were available for 273 lung cancer patients treated with curative chemoradiotherapy. Clinical data included gender, age, World Health Organization performance score, nicotine use, diabetes, chronic disease, tumor type, tumor stage, lymph node stage, tumor location, and medical center. Treatment parameters included chemotherapy, surgery, radiotherapy technique, tumor dose, mean fractionation size, mean and maximal esophageal dose, and overall treatment time. A total of 332 genetic polymorphisms were considered in 112 candidate genes. The predicting model was achieved by lasso logistic regression for predictor selection, followed by classic logistic regression for unbiased estimation of the coefficients. Performance of the model was expressed as the area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic and as the false-negative rate in the optimal point on the receiver operating characteristic curve.


RESULTS
A total of 110 patients (40%) developed acute esophagitis Grade â‰¥2 (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0). The final model contained chemotherapy treatment, lymph node stage, mean esophageal dose, gender, overall treatment time, radiotherapy technique, rs2302535 (EGFR), rs16930129 (ENG), rs1131877 (TRAF3), and rs2230528 (ITGB2). The area under the curve was 0.87, and the false-negative rate was 16%.


CONCLUSION
Prediction of acute esophagitis can be improved by combining clinical, treatment, and genetic factors. A multicomponent prediction model for acute esophagitis with a sensitivity of 84% was constructed with two clinical parameters, four treatment parameters, and four genetic polymorphisms.",2011,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics"
"El mundo, que existe y no existe a la vez: el espacio y la lÃ³gica del realismo especulativo","En el presente articulo se muestran los argumentos y los supuestos logico-matematicos que estan a la base de la fundamentacion del realismo especulativo de Quentin Meillassoux y de Markus Gabriel. Se muestra que, en el caso de ambos, si bien reivindican la ciencia empirica, todo su proyecto depende de una aprehension particular de la logica y de la matematica. Las argumentaciones de Meillassoux y de Gabriel a favor del realismo descansan enteramente en la tesis de Badiou de que la filosofia especulativa solamente es posible a partir de la matematica y, dentro de ella, en el marco de la teoria de conjuntos. En el articulo se exponen algunas limitaciones de la teoria de conjuntos a la luz de sus paradojas clasicas, pero, de manera mas importante, a partir de su confrontacion con la teoria de categorias, teoria que se disputa con aquella la fundacion de las matematicas. Se busca entonces apuntar a una ontologia fundada en categorias mas que en conjuntos. Al mismo tiempo, se ofrece una defensa del realismo, pero desde un punto de vista schellinguiano, el cual trata de empatarse tambien con el enfoque categorico en matematicas.",2020,
