GLUP: Yet another algorithm for blind unmixing of hyperspectral data,"This paper addresses the problem of blind fully-constrained linear unmixing of hyperspectral images. The endmembers and their cardinality are assumed unknown, but the endmember spectra are supposed to be present in the scene. Group Lasso regularization is used to extract the endmembers. The estimation problem is convex, and solved with the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers. Comparisons with state-of-the-art methods on synthetic and real data sets show the efficiency of our approach.",2014,2014 6th Workshop on Hyperspectral Image and Signal Processing: Evolution in Remote Sensing (WHISPERS)
"Annotated text databases in the context of the Kaj Munk corpus: One database model, one query language, and several applications","The central theme of this PhD dissertation is â€œannotated tex t databasesâ€. An annotated text database is a collection of text plus information about tha text, stored in a computer system for easy update and access. The â€œinformation ab ut the textâ€ constitutes the annotations of the text. My PhD work has been carried out under the organizational umb rella of the Kaj Munk Research Centre at Aalborg University, Denmark. Kaj Munk (1 898â€“1944) was an influential and prolific playwright, journalist, pastor, and poe t, whose influence was widely felt â€” both inside and outside of Denmark â€” during the period b etween World War I and World War II. He was murdered by Gestapo in early January 1 944 for his resistance stance. The two main tasks of the Kaj Munk Research Centre in which I ha ve been involved during my PhD work are: a) Digitizing the nachlassof Kaj Munk, and b) Making the texts of Kaj Munk available electronically to the general pu blic. My dissertation reflects these tasks by taking the works of Kaj Munk as the empirical ba sis, the empirical sample data, on which to test the theoretical advancements made in m y dissertation. My work has thus not been about Kaj Munk or his works as seen fro m a historical or even literary perspective. My perspective on Kaj Munkâ€™s wor ks has been that of a computer scientist seeking to represent annotated versions of Kaj Munkâ€™s works in a computer database system, and supporting easy querying of these anno tated texts. As such, the fact that the empirical basis has been Kaj Munkâ€™s works is largely immaterial; the principles crystallized, the methods obtained, and the system impleme nted could equally well have been brought to bear on any other collection of annotated tex t. Future research might see such endeavors. The theoretical advancements which I have gained during my P hD build on the work of a number of other people, the primary point of departure be ing the work of Dr. Crist-Jan Doedens in his PhD dissertation from 1994: â€œText Databases â€” One Database Model and Several Retrieval Languagesâ€, University of Utrecht, the N etherlands. Dr. Doedens, in his PhD dissertation, described the â€œMonads dot Featuresâ€ (or M dF) model of annotated text, as well as the â€œQL query languageâ€ defined over MdF databases. In my work, I have taken the MdF text database model, and have b oth reduced it in scope in some areas, and have also extended it in other areas, thus arriving at the EMdF model. I have also taken Doedensâ€™s QL query language, and hav e reduced part of it to a slightly smaller sub-language, but have also extended it in numerous ways, thus arriving at the â€œMQL query languageâ€. The EMdF model is able to express almost any annotation neces sary for representing linguistic annotations of text. As I show in Chapter 10, it is certainly the case that all of the annotations with which we in the Kaj Munk Research Centre have desired to enrich the Kaj Munk Corpus, can be expressed in the EMdF model.",2008,
Microfossil Evidence for Development of Marine Mesozoic in the North of South China Sea,"Microfossils,including spores,pollen and radiolarian,were found in the Mesozoic which was first encountered in Well MZ-1-1 in the north of the South China Sea.The geological time of the spore and pollen assemblage dominated by Classopollis and Cyathdites is given as the middle Jurassic,which was recovered from the interval 2 187ï½ž2 388 m of Well MZ-1-1.The siliceous rocks occurring in the interval 1 725ï½ž1 887 m of this well contains late Jurassic to early Cretaceous radiolarian assemblages,mainly including Caneta hsui,Loopus primitivus,Dibolachras sp.cf.D.apletopora.The results of microfossil analysis have demonstrated the occurrence of marine Jurassic and Cretaceous in the north of the South China Sea.The spore and pollen assemblage dominated by Classopollis and Cyathdites reflects the tropical to subtropical coastal vegetation and coastal marshland that developed in the north of the South China Sea during the middle Jurassic.The deposition environment changed greatly and the deep water reigned in this region during the late Jurassic to early Cretaceous.",2007,Marine Geology & Quaternary Geology

The risk of machine learning,"Many applied settings in empirical economics involve simultaneous estimation of a large number of parameters. In particular, applied economists are often interested in estimating the effects of many-valued treatments (like teacher effects or location effects), treatment effects for many groups, and prediction models with many regressors. In these settings, machine learning methods that combine regularized estimation and data-driven choices of regularization parameters are useful to avoid over-fitting. In this article, we analyze the performance of a class of such methods that includes ridge, lasso, and pretest, in contexts that require simultaneous estimation of many parameters. Our analysis aims to provide guidance to applied researchers on (i) the choice between regularized estimators in practice and (ii) data-driven selection of regularization parameters. To address (i), we characterize the risk (mean squared error) of regularized estimators and derive their relative performance as a function of simple features of the data generating process. To address (ii), we show that data-driven choices of regularization parameters, based on Stein's unbiased risk estimate or on cross-validation, yield estimators with risk uniformly close to the risk attained under the optimal (unfeasible) choice of regularization parameters. We use data from recent examples in the empirical economics literature to illustrate the practical applicability of our results.",2017,arXiv: Machine Learning
Sparse Principal Covariates Regression for high-dimensional data,"Prediction in a context of high-dimensional data, this is data with many more covariates than observations, is an ill-posed problem. Popular solutions are the introduction of penalties that perform variable selection (e.g., the lasso or elastic net in regression) and the use of dimension reduction methods to reduce the covariates to a few components (e.g., principal covariates regression that simultaneously optimizes the reduction of the covariates to a few components and the prediction of the outcome by these components). From an interpretational point of view it is attractive to reduce the covariate space to a few meaningful components. However, in a high-dimensional context interpretation of the components is daunting as the components are based on a linear combination of a huge number of variables. To account for this interpretational issue, we propose a sparse principal covariates regression approach that selects a limited number of relevant variables to construct the components and that uses an alternating least squares and coordinate descent estimation procedure. We will compare with sparse partial least squares and illustrate with a systems vaccinology example with the aim to predict the antibody titers for subjects vaccinated against the flu by thousands of genes.",2015,International Federation of Classification Societies
Separable regularization penalties and structured sparsity,"It has been shown in literature that the Lasso, or l1-penalized estimator, enjoys good oracle properties.

Relevant scientific contributions concerning the use of ROC curves for microarray data are briefly reviewed in Subheading 2. The special case with covariates is considered in Subheading 3. Two relevant aspects are reviewed in this section: the use of LASSO techniques for selecting and combining relevant markers and how to correct for multiple testing when a large number of markers are available. Finally, some conclusions are included.",2019,Methods in molecular biology
LassoNet: Neural networks with Feature Sparsity.,"We introduce LassoNet, a neural network model with global feature selection. The model uses a residual connection to learn a subset of the most informative input features. Specifically, the model honors a hierarchy restriction that an input neuron only be included if its linear variable is important. This produces a path of feature-sparse models in close analogy with the lasso for linear regression, while effectively capturing complex nonlinear dependencies in the data. Using a single residual block, our iterative algorithm yields an efficient proximal map which accurately selects the most salient features. On systematic experiments, LassoNet achieves competitive performance using a much smaller number of input features. LassoNet can be implemented by adding just a few lines of code to a standard neural network.",2019,arXiv: Machine Learning
Simultaneous Variable Selection and Outlier Detection Using Lasso with Applications to Aircraft Landing Data Analysis,"OF THE DISSERTATION Simultaneous Variable Selection and Outlier Detection Using LASSO with Applications to Aircraft Landing Data Analysis by Wei Li Dissertation Director: Regina Y. Liu, Minge Xie, and Cun-Hui Zhang We propose a LASSO-type penalized regression method for simultaneous variable selection and outlier detection in high dimensional linear regression. We apply a mean-shift model to incorporate the coefficients associated with the potential outliers by expressing them as different intercept terms. The sparsity assumption is imposed on both X-covariates and the outlier indicator variables. With suitable penalty factors between X-covaraites and the outlier indicators, we show that the proposed method selects a model of the correct order of dimensionality, under the sparse Riesz condition on the correlation of design variables and a joint sparse Reisz condition on the augmented design matrix. We also show that the estimation/prediction of the selected model can be controlled at a level determined by the sizes of the true model, the outliers and the thresholding level. Moreover, the estimation has a positive breakdown point when both the dimension p and the sample size n tend to infinity, and p >> n. We also provide a generalized version for the estimator by adjusting the penalty weight factor. Finally, we apply the proposed method to analyze an aircraft landing performance data set, for identifying the precursors for undesirable landing performance and reducing the risk of runway overruns.",2012,
P.1. Supraventricular Arrhythmias,"Objectives We report the first clinical experiences with the CARTO-Merge (Biosense-Webster, Diamond Bar, CA, USA) combined with intracardiac ultrasound (ICE) (Acuson, Mountain View, CA, USA) both used for navigation and catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF).

Methods 18 patients (15 men, 61Â±10 years) underwent pulmonary vein antrum isolation for symptomatic, drug-resistant AF using Lasso catheter, ICE and CARTO-Merge. The latter system integrated 3D CTA images of the left atrium and pulmonary veins with virtual CARTO maps. Firstly, 3-4 points (Landmarks) were registered on CTA scan according to the real-time position on the electroanatomical map, than 20-40 surface points of the CARTO map were added to finish the registration of the CT scan. Subsequently, the 3D CT anatomical map was used for catheter navigation. Correlation between this reconstruction, ICE and fluoroscopy was documented. Accuracy of the system was evaluated by the software statistical analysis.

Results The mean surface inaccuracy was: 2.1Â±1.6 mm and the mean Landmarks inaccuracy was 8.9Â±3.0 mm, which reaches the recommended range.

Conclusion This novel system appears to have a reliable correlation between CTA and real-time CARTO maps.",2005,Europace

One-step estimator paths for concave regularization,"ABSTRACTThe statistics literature of the past 15 years has established many favorable properties for sparse diminishing-bias regularization: techniques that can roughly be understood as providing estimation under penalty functions spanning the range of concavity between l0 and l1 norms. However, lasso l1-regularized estimation remains the standard tool for industrial Big Data applications because of its minimal computational cost and the presence of easy-to-apply rules for penalty selection. In response, this article proposes a simple new algorithm framework that requires no more computation than a lasso path: the path of one-step estimators (POSE) does l1 penalized regression estimation on a grid of decreasing penalties, but adapts coefficient-specific weights to decrease as a function of the coefficient estimated in the previous path step. This provides sparse diminishing-bias regularization at no extra cost over the fastest lasso algorithms. Moreover, our gamma lasso implementation of POSE is accompani...",2013,Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics
Growth of Meningopneumonitis Virus in the Chick Embryo.,"A number of reports have been published concerning the infectivity of meningopneumonitis virus in which the number of virus particles per infectious unit has been determined (Crocker, 1954; Manire and Smith, 1959; Manire and Galasso, 1959). The results have varied somewhat according to the source and treatment of the virus and the techniques used to measure infectivity, with values ranging from approximately 10 to 1,000 particles per yolk sac LD,0 being reported. The rate of growth of this virus has also been the subject of various studies. Weiss (1949) reported that the initial growth cycle was about 48 hr. Sigel, Girardi, and Allen (1951) reported similar findings, with new virus appearing in the allantoic fluid of inoculated embryos after 48 hr incubation, and an increase in infectivity titer occurring within the membranes after 24 hr. Virus titration in these studies, however, was based on infectivity tests, and the actual number of virus particles produced was not determined. The growth of various members of the psittacosis-lymphogranuloma venereum group has been reviewed in detail by Weiss (1955) and Wenner (1958). The experiments reported here were initiated to solve a practical problem of obtaining maximal yields of virus for use in antigen studies. Growth curves were determined by counting virus particles either free in egg fluids or in egg tissues, and this technique was used to study rates of virus growth in allantoic membranes and yolk sacs.",1961,Journal of bacteriology

Benchmarking bacterial genome-wide association study methods using simulated genomes and phenotypes.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have the potential to reveal the genetics of microbial phenotypes such as antibiotic resistance and virulence. Capitalizing on the growing wealth of bacterial sequence data, microbial GWAS methods aim to identify causal genetic variants while ignoring spurious associations. Bacteria reproduce clonally, leading to strong population structure and genome-wide linkage, making it challenging to separate true 'hits' (i.e. mutations that cause a phenotype) from non-causal linked mutations. GWAS methods attempt to correct for population structure in different ways, but their performance has not yet been systematically and comprehensively evaluated under a range of evolutionary scenarios. Here, we developed a bacterial GWAS simulator (BacGWASim) to generate bacterial genomes with varying rates of mutation, recombination and other evolutionary parameters, along with a subset of causal mutations underlying a phenotype of interest. We assessed the performance (recall and precision) of three widely used single-locus GWAS approaches (cluster-based, dimensionality-reduction and linear mixed models, implemented in plink, pyseer and gemma) and one relatively new multi-locus model implemented in pyseer, across a range of simulated sample sizes, recombination rates and causal mutation effect sizes. As expected, all methods performed better with larger sample sizes and effect sizes. The performance of clustering and dimensionality reduction approaches to correct for population structure were considerably variable according to the choice of parameters. Notably, the multi-locus elastic net (lasso) approach was consistently amongst the highest-performing methods, and had the highest power in detecting causal variants with both low and high effect sizes. Most methods reached the level of good performance (recall >0.75) for identifying causal mutations of strong effect size [log odds ratio (OR) â‰¥2] with a sample size of 2000 genomes. However, only elastic nets reached the level of reasonable performance (recall=0.35) for detecting markers with weaker effects (log OR ~1) in smaller samples. Elastic nets also showed superior precision and recall in controlling for genome-wide linkage, relative to single-locus models. However, all methods performed relatively poorly on highly clonal (low-recombining) genomes, suggesting room for improvement in method development. These findings show the potential for multi-locus models to improve bacterial GWAS performance. BacGWASim code and simulated data are publicly available to enable further comparisons and benchmarking of new methods.",2020,Microbial genomics
Definition of a novel vascular invasion-associated multi-gene signature for predicting survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma,"The aim of the present study was to identify a vascular invasion-associated gene signature for predicting prognosis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Using RNA-sequencing data of 292 HCC samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the present study screened differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between patients with and without vascular invasion. Feature genes were selected from the DEGs by support vector machine (SVM)-based recursive feature elimination (RFE-SVM) algorithm to build a classifier. A multi-gene signature was selected by L1 penalized (LASSO) Cox proportional hazards (PH) regression model from the feature genes selected by the RFE-SVM to develop a prognostic scoring model. TCGA set was defined as the training set and was divided by the gene signature into a high-risk group and a low-risk group. Involvement of the DEGs between the two risk groups in pathways was also investigated. The presence and absence of vascular invasion between patients of training set was 175 DEGs. A classification model of 42 genes performed well in differentiating patients with and without vascular invasion on the training set and the validation set. A 14-gene prognostic model was built that could divide the training set or the validation set into two risk groups with significantly different survival outcomes. A total of 762 DEGs in the two risk groups of the training set were revealed to be significantly associated with a number of signaling pathways. The present study provided a 42-gene classifier for predicting vascular invasion, and identified a vascular invasion-associated 14-gene signature for predicting prognosis in patients with HCC. Several genes and pathways in HCC development are characterized and may be potential therapeutic targets for this type of cancer.",2020,Oncology Letters

Variable selection in a flexible parametric mixture cure model with intervalâ€censored data,"In standard survival analysis, it is generally assumed that every individual will experience someday the event of interest. However, this is not always the case, as some individuals may not be susceptible to this event. Also, in medical studies, it is frequent that patients come to scheduled interviews and that the time to the event is only known to occur between two visits. That is, the data are interval-censored with a cure fraction. Variable selection in such a setting is of outstanding interest. Covariates impacting the survival are not necessarily the same as those impacting the probability to experience the event. The objective of this paper is to develop a parametric but flexible statistical model to analyze data that are interval-censored and include a fraction of cured individuals when the number of potential covariates may be large. We use the parametric mixture cure model with an accelerated failure time regression model for the survival, along with the extended generalized gamma for the error term. To overcome the issue of non-stable and non-continuous variable selection procedures, we extend the adaptive LASSO to our model. By means of simulation studies, we show good performance of our method and discuss the behavior of estimates with varying cure and censoring proportion. Lastly, our proposed method is illustrated with a real dataset studying the time until conversion to mild cognitive impairment, a possible precursor of Alzheimer's disease.",2016,Statistics in Medicine

The development of a practical and uncomplicated predictive equation to determine liver volume from simple linear ultrasound measurements of the liver,"This study sought to develop a practical and uncomplicated predictive equation that could accurately calculate liver volumes, using multiple simple linear ultrasound measurements combined with measurements of body size. Penalized (lasso) regression was used to develop a new model and compare it to the ultrasonic linear measurements currently used clinically. A Blandâ€“Altman analysis showed that the large limits of agreement of the new model render it too inaccurate to be of clinical use for estimating liver volume per se, but it holds value in tracking disease progress or response to treatment over time in individuals, and is certainly substantially better as an indicator of overall liver size than the ultrasonic linear measurements currently being used clinically.",2016,Radiography
"Bayesian LASSO, Scale Space and Decision Making in Association Genetics","BACKGROUND
LASSO is a penalized regression method that facilitates model fitting in situations where there are as many, or even more explanatory variables than observations, and only a few variables are relevant in explaining the data. We focus on the Bayesian version of LASSO and consider four problems that need special attention: (i) controlling false positives, (ii) multiple comparisons, (iii) collinearity among explanatory variables, and (iv) the choice of the tuning parameter that controls the amount of shrinkage and the sparsity of the estimates. The particular application considered is association genetics, where LASSO regression can be used to find links between chromosome locations and phenotypic traits in a biological organism. However, the proposed techniques are relevant also in other contexts where LASSO is used for variable selection.


RESULTS
We separate the true associations from false positives using the posterior distribution of the effects (regression coefficients) provided by Bayesian LASSO. We propose to solve the multiple comparisons problem by using simultaneous inference based on the joint posterior distribution of the effects. Bayesian LASSO also tends to distribute an effect among collinear variables, making detection of an association difficult. We propose to solve this problem by considering not only individual effects but also their functionals (i.e. sums and differences). Finally, whereas in Bayesian LASSO the tuning parameter is often regarded as a random variable, we adopt a scale space view and consider a whole range of fixed tuning parameters, instead. The effect estimates and the associated inference are considered for all tuning parameters in the selected range and the results are visualized with color maps that provide useful insights into data and the association problem considered. The methods are illustrated using two sets of artificial data and one real data set, all representing typical settings in association genetics.",2015,PLoS ONE
Feature Selection and Classification Reveal Key lncRNAs for Multiple Cancers,"Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) plays key roles in tumorigenesis. Misexpression of lncRNA can lead to changes in expression profiles of various target genes, which are involved in cancer initiation and progression. So, identifying key lncRNAs for a cancer would help develop the cancer therapy. Usually, to identify key lncRNAs for a cancer, expression profiles of lncRNAs for normal and cancer samples are required. But, this kind of data are not available for all cancers. In the present study, a computational framework is developed to identify cancer specific key lncRNAs using the lncRNA expression of cancer patients only. The framework consists of two state-of-the-art feature selection techniques - Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO); and five machine learning models - Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Deep Neural Network. For experiment, expression values of lncRNAs for 8 cancers - BLCA, CESC, COAD, HNSC, KIRP, LGG, LIHC, and LUAD - from TCGA are used. The combined dataset consists of 3,656 patients with expression values of 12,309 lncRNAs. Important features or key lncRNAs are identified by using feature selection algorithms RFE and LASSO. Capability of these key lncRNAs in classifying 8 different cancers is checked by the performance of five classification models. This study identified 37 key lncRNAs that can classify 8 different cancer types with an accuracy ranging from 94% to 97%. Finally, survival analysis supports that the discovered key lncRNAs are capable of differentiating between high-risk and low-risk patients.",2019,2019 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)
The Sparse Matrix Transform for Covariance Estimation and Analysis of High Dimensional Signals,"Covariance estimation for high dimensional signals is a classically difficult problem in statistical signal analysis and machine learning. In this paper, we propose a maximum likelihood (ML) approach to covariance estimation, which employs a novel non-linear sparsity constraint. More specifically, the covariance is constrained to have an eigen decomposition which can be represented as a sparse matrix transform (SMT). The SMT is formed by a product of pairwise coordinate rotations known as Givens rotations. Using this framework, the covariance can be efficiently estimated using greedy optimization of the log-likelihood function, and the number of Givens rotations can be efficiently computed using a cross-validation procedure. The resulting estimator is generally positive definite and well-conditioned, even when the sample size is limited. Experiments on a combination of simulated data, standard hyperspectral data, and face image sets show that the SMT-based covariance estimates are consistently more accurate than both traditional shrinkage estimates and recently proposed graphical lasso estimates for a variety of different classes and sample sizes. An important property of the new covariance estimate is that it naturally yields a fast implementation of the estimated eigen-transformation using the SMT representation. In fact, the SMT can be viewed as a generalization of the classical fast Fourier transform (FFT) in that it uses â€œbutterfliesâ€ to represent an orthonormal transform. However, unlike the FFT, the SMT can be used for fast eigen-signal analysis of general non-stationary signals.",2011,IEEE Transactions on Image Processing
"L'Ã©thique, ou comment s'orienter dans l'existence","The project of our thesis is to demonstrate certain absolutely valid ethical principles which would enable every man to orient himself in the existence and every community to organise itself in the most just and egalitarian manner possible. We accomplish this demonstration by grounding it in the factual ontology as developed by Quentin Meillassoux. More precisely, we ground the ethical principles in his demonstration of the absolute necessity of contingency from which we derive itâ€™s ethical implications whose absolute validity is thereby also demonstrated.The demonstration of the absolute ethical principles and their application to the empirical facts of the existing world make it possible to determine clearly the just rules that should be respected by every community in the existing world.The determination of these rules brings us to the conclusion that the most just form of society in our world would be a world-wide communist state whose rules of production and distribution of goods would be very similar to those that governed the communist states of the 20th century. We show that there are some essential differences between these two forms of communist states among which especially the following one : the fundamental principles of the organisation of a communist state are now for the first time clearly demonstrated and thereby comprehensible to everyone. Consequently, the legitimisation of these (communist) principles no longer needs any blind faith in the figure of the Chief or that of the Party which were supposed to be above our clear comprehension in the communist states of the 20th century.",2016,
On the linear convergence of the alternating direction method of multipliers,"We analyze the convergence rate of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for minimizing the sum of two or more nonsmooth convex separable functions subject to linear constraints. Previous analysis of the ADMM typically assumes that the objective function is the sum of only two convex functions defined on two separable blocks of variables even though the algorithm works well in numerical experiments for three or more blocks. Moreover, there has been no rate of convergence analysis for the ADMM without strong convexity in the objective function. In this paper we establish the global R-linear convergence of the ADMM for minimizing the sum of any number of convex separable functions, assuming that a certain error bound condition holds true and the dual stepsize is sufficiently small. Such an error bound condition is satisfied for example when the feasible set is a compact polyhedron and the objective function consists of a smooth strictly convex function composed with a linear mapping, and a nonsmooth $$\ell _1$$â„“1 regularizer. This result implies the linear convergence of the ADMM for contemporary applications such as LASSO without assuming strong convexity of the objective function.",2017,Mathematical Programming
Happy Greys are Here Again (African Grey Parrots Psittacus erithacus erithacus at Disney's Animal Kingdom),"Introduction In April 1998 Disney's Animal Kingdom (OAK) received two previously unpaired African Grey Parrots from a Colorado based foundation dedicated to accepting or rescuing unwanted pet birds. Both Greys, a male and female, had their original USDA quarantine bands and were therefore known to be wild caught specimens. The records available revealed that the birds were not strangers to captive life, the male being a pet bird for approximately 19 years and the female for nine years. The birds have contrasting personalities, the female heing very skittish, growling when approached by humans, while the male is not shy andwas stick trained easily. Both birds often carried on with the familiar repertoire of wolf whistles, cat meows, and assorted calls that most pet Greys seem to quickly learn and mimic. Both birds arrived with clipped flight feathers and were quick to become friends with each other when placed in adjoining cages during their quarantine period. Subtle variations in color make this Grey subspecies easily sexed visually, the male having more evenly dark charcoal gray coloration from his wing coverts to his primary flight feathers and from chest to vent, while the female has more defined contrast in color from light gray to charcoal gray in the same areas as well as the gray scalloping coloration of the chest continuing through the red feathers surrounding the vent (the male has solid red feathers surrounding his vent). A slight size difference also exists between the pair with the male' weighing 480g and the female 430g. The Greys were brought to the African aviary for introduction following the required quarantine period and medical examination in which fecal samples are taken and blood chemistries performed. The Habitat TI1e African Aviary at DAK covers an area 162 feet Jong by 62 feet wide and 45 feet high. The aviary space is approximately 450,000 cubic feet and includes mature trees that create a nearly unbroken canopy overhead. A two story waterfall pours into pools at two different levels intentionally flooding areas which become ""tidal zones."" A path meanders through the center of the aviary allowing guests a close encounter with 23 avian species--over 140 individual specimens. Inlune of 1998 we were prepared to introduce the Greys to their enormous new home. Since neither bird had regrown its primary flight feathers, and therefore was incapable of comfortably and confidently reaching feeding areas, nor capable of retreating from curious and not always friendly aviary inhabitants, a unique process of introduction would have to he employed. We decided to place the birds in one of the mature trees in the aviary so that they had the opportunity to become accustomed to guests and other aviary inhabitants while remaining under the watchful eye of the aviary staff. We soon found that the Greys had other plans. We hoped that the pair might remain within arms reach or within a close proximity so that they could he easily retrieved with a stick, hut they traveled on foot, climbing through the tops of the trees with no intentions of coming aviary for introduction following the required quarantine period and medical examination in which fecal samples are taken and blood chemistries performed.

By the end of their first week the pair was roosting overnight in the top of their favorite tree and climbed through the mid and upper canopies to reach feeding stations located in the aviary introduction cages. Meeting the Neighbors The OAK African Aviary is home to a wide range of birds and, being clever, intelligent, and curious, the Greys were likely to cross paths with a variety of avian species. The other aviary inhabitants include aquatic birds such as African Jacanas Actopbilornis africanus, Pygmy Geese Neuapus auritus; Whitebacked Ducks Tbalassornis leuconotus, and Hottentot Teal Anas hottentota. The more arboreal bird species that the Greys may have occasional or frequent contact with include Hadada Ibis Hagedasbia hagedosh breuirostris, Hammerkops Scopus umbretta, Superb Starlings Spree superbus, Gold-breasted Starlings Cosrnopsarus regius, Emerald Starlings Lamprotornis iris, Amethyst Starlings Cinnyricinclus leucogaster, Olive Pigeons Columba arquatrix; Lady Ross's Turacos Musopbaga rossae, Long-tailed Magpie Shrikes Connnella melanoleuca, Carmine Bee-eaters Merops n. nubicus, Snowy-headed Robin Chat Cossypha niueicapilla, White-bellied Go-away Birds Corytbaixoides leucogaster; Blue-naped Mousehirds Colius indicus, Tavera Golden Weavers Ploceus castaneiceps, and Racket-tailed Rollers Coracias spatulata. Once the Greys became familiar with their new home they began to interact unfavorably with several of the other aviary birds. The first of their had habits was to eat from feeding stations that were customarily used by the more shy or delicate birds. Though their wings were clipped, only allowing for short bursts of energy, the Greys frequently lunged at smaller passerines, such as mousebirds, weavers and even bee-eaters. They also took up parttime residence within the feeding zones of many other birds, displacing anyone that approached too closely.",2000,AFA Watchbird
UQMSG Experiments for TRECVID 2011,"This paper describes the experimental framework of the University of Queensland's Multimedia Search Group (UQMSG) at TRECVID 2011. We participated in two tasks this year, both for the first time. For the semantic indexing task, we submitted four lite runs: L_A_UQMSG1_1, L_A_UQMSG2_2, L_A_UQMSG3_3 and L_A_UQMSG4_4. They are all of training type A (actually we only used IACC.1.tv10.training data), but with different parameter settings in our keyframe-based Laplacian Joint Group Lasso (LJGL) algorithm with Local Binary Patterns (LBP) feature. For the content-based copy detection task, we submitted two runs: UQMSG.m.nofa.mfh and UQMSG.m.balanced.mfh. They used only the video modality information of keyframes and were both based on our Multiple Feature Hashing (MFH) algorithm that fuses local (LBP) and global (HSV) visual features, with different application profiles (reducing the false alarm rate v.s. balancing false alarms and misses). Due to time constraint, we were not able to improve the performance of our systems adequately on all the available training data this year for these tasks. Evaluation results suggest that more efforts need to be made to well tune system parameters. In addition, sophisticated techniques beyond applying keyframe-level semantic concept propagation and near-duplicate detection are required for achieving better performance in video tasks.",2011,

Our results show that norepinephrine (NE) depletion induces a novel state in male mice characterized by a profound disruption of coherence across multiple cortico-striatal circuits and an increase in mesolimbic cross-structural coherence. Moreover, this brain state is accompanied by a complex behavioral phenotype consisting of transient hyperactivity, stereotypic behaviors, and an acute 12-fold increase in grooming. Notably, treatment with a norepinephrine precursors (L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine at 100 mg/kg or L-threo-dihydroxyphenylserine at 5 mg/kg) or a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (fluoxetine at 20 mg/kg) attenuates the abnormal behaviors and selectively reverses the circuit changes observed in NE-depleted mice.

The corneal epithelial surface in the eyes of vertebrates: environmental and evolutionary influences on structure and function.,"The smooth optical surface of the cornea is maintained by a tear film, which adheres to a variety of microprojections. These microprojections increase the cell surface area and are thought to improve the movement of oxygen, nutrients, and metabolic products across the outer cell membranes. However, little is known of these structural adaptations in vertebrates inhabiting different environments. This field emission scanning electron microscopic study examined the cell density and surface structure of corneal epithelial cells across 51 representative species of all vertebrate classes from a large range of habitats (aquatic, amphibious, terrestrial, and aerial). In particular, we wished to extend the range of vertebrates to include agnathans and some uniquely Australian species, such as the Australian lungfish (Neoceratodus forsteri), the Australian galah (Eolophus roseicapillus), the Australian koala (Phascolarctos cinereus), and the rat-tailed dunnart (Sminthopsis crassicaudata). Epithelial cell densities ranged from 28,860 +/- 9,214 cells mm(-2) in the flathead sole Hippoglossoides elassodon (a marine teleost) to 2,126 +/- 713 cells mm(-2) in the Australian koala (a terrestrial mammal), which may indicate a reduction in osmotic stress across the corneal surface. A similar reduction in cell density occurred from marine to estuarine to freshwater species. The structure and occurrence of microholes, microplicae, microridges, and microvilli are also described with respect to the demands placed on the cornea in different environments. All species that spend significant periods out of an aquatic environment possess microvilli and/or microplicae. These include all of our species of Mammalia, Aves, Reptilia, Amphibia, and even one species of Teleostei (Australian lungfish). Well-developed microridges occur only in teleosts in high osmolarity environments such as marine or estuarine habitats. Clear interspecific differences in corneal surface structure suggest a degree of adaptive plasticity, in addition to some phylogenetic trends.",2006,Journal of morphology
Efficient Structure-Aware Selection Techniques for 3D Point Cloud Visualizations with 2DOF Input,"Data selection is a fundamental task in visualization because it serves as a pre-requisite to many follow-up interactions. Efficient spatial selection in 3D point cloud datasets consisting of thousands or millions of particles can be particularly challenging. We present two new techniques, TeddySelection and CloudLasso, that support the selection of subsets in large particle 3D datasets in an interactive and visually intuitive manner. Specifically, we describe how to spatially select a subset of a 3D particle cloud by simply encircling the target particles on screen using either the mouse or direct-touch input. Based on the drawn lasso, our techniques automatically determine a bounding selection surface around the encircled particles based on their density. This kind of selection technique can be applied to particle datasets in several application domains. TeddySelection and CloudLasso reduce, and in some cases even eliminate, the need for complex multi-step selection processes involving Boolean operations. This was confirmed in a formal, controlled user study in which we compared the more flexible CloudLasso technique to the standard cylinder-based selection technique. This study showed that the former is consistently more efficient than the latter - in several cases the CloudLasso selection time was half that of the corresponding cylinder-based selection.",2012,IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics
"Molecular phylogenetic relationships among some stygobitic cirolanid species (Crustacea, Isopoda)","Within the Cirolanidae, a widespread family of marine isopods, about 23 genera are stygobitic and inhabit phreatic and anchialine ecosystems, with many endemic species. The Mediterranean area has a high biodiversity of subterranean cirolanids, which are considered thalassoid limnostygobionts. A molecular analysis was conducted using mtDNA genes to infer the phylogeny of species belonging to six of the seven stygobitic genera of Cirolanidae inhabiting the Mediterranean basin and to two American taxa: Faucheria faucheri, Marocolana delamarei, Saharolana seurati, Sphaeromides virei virei, Turcolana sp., 13 taxa of the genus Typhlocirolana and two American species, Antrolana lira and Speocirolana bolivari. The Typhlocirolana species are widespread in the western Mediterranean basin, with a concentration of taxa in the Maghreb region. Turcolana sp. is localised in the eastern Mediterranean, while F. faucheri and S. v. virei are north Mediterranean taxa. S. seurati, the taxon least morphologically adapted to subterranean life, belongs to a monospecific genus present in a Tunisian spring. The molecular phylogeny showed a high affinity among the American taxa and the Mediterranean Sphaeromides, clustering in the Sphaeromides group identified by previous morphological studies. Typhlocirolana species and M. delamarei constitute their sister clade within the Sphaeromides group. F. faucheri appears to be a sister clade of the Sphaeromides group. S. seurati, showing reduced troglobitic adaptations, assumes disparate and unsolved positions in the phylogenetic reconstructions. The molecular data suggest that a combination of vicariance and dispersal events, occurring from 180 to a few million years ago, combined to bring about the present distribution pattern of Mediterranean cirolanid isopods.",2010,Contributions to Zoology

Fecal Calprotectin in Monitoring the Disease Activity in Colonic Inflammatory Bowel Disease,"We read with interest the article by Anna-Maija Puolanne et al. [1] evaluating the activity of colonic inflammation by combining the symptom index with a rapid semiquantitative fecal calprotectin (FC) test. The author found that the new symptom index and the combination index are simple, noninvasive means for distinguishing remission from active inflammation in colonic IBD. Because their findings are important to both current practice and future research, several questions deserve attention. Firstly, the inflamed area in patients with colonic IBD is limited. A recent study found that even in the presence of large ulcers, IBD patients did not have markedly elevated FC levels [2]. It will be of interest whether FC has sufficient sensitivity to detect these lesions in patients with colonic IBD. Secondly, the specificity of FC has been questioned in IBD patients. In IBD patients, there will be some degree of variability based on the disease activity, location and scope, and body mass indices. And studies showed that various medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, aspirin, and statins could alter FC levels beside stated medications. Also, dietary supplements such as zinc, vitamin D, fatty acids, and several probiotics can affect FC levels. We believe these variables could be effective on the measurement of FC in IBD patients. The issue of intraindividual variability must be considered within the context of the population measured, and there is variability of FC concentrations within IBD patients. To maximize their utility, FC that is measured on a continuous scale should be considered along the continuum across which they are measured rather than exclusively as a dichotomous variable. There is a trade-off between sensitivity and specificity across the continuum. Thirdly, the monitor value of FC in IBD patients has been debated due to inconsistent results in some studies, because these studies have set the different FC cutoff levels. For example, Rocio Ferreiro-Iglesiasâ€™s study showed that FC levels\ 130 lg/g are consistently associated with maintained disease remission, whereas concentrations[ 300 lg/g allow predicting relapse with a high probability at any time over the following 4 months [3]. But Mooiweer Eâ€™s study showed that FC\ 56 mg/kg was found to optimally predict the absence of relapse during follow-up with 64% sensitivity and 100% specificity [4]. Gisbert JPâ€™s study showed that FC[ 150 lg/g may be useful in predicting clinical relapse with 69% sensitivity and 69% specificity [5]. Walkiewicz Dâ€™s study showed that FC[ 400 lg/g may be useful in predicting impending clinical relapse [6]. And Lasson et al. [7] suggested that there was a great instability in the concentrations of FC in stool samples collected during a single day. Therefore, the issue of intra-individual variability must be considered. In conclusion, FC has a potential role in disease activity monitoring for colonic IBD patients. And the combination use of other fecal markers such as fecal lactoferrin and polymorphonuclear neutrophil elastase (PMN-e) based on patient characteristics could improve the sensitivity and specificity. Future studies are needed to evaluate whether disease activity in colonic IBD patients monitoring by FC alters clinical outcomes in the long term. & Cong Dai congdai2006@sohu.com",2017,Digestive Diseases and Sciences
Biodiversity of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria from deep sea sediments of the Middle Atlantic Ridge,"The bacteria involved in the biodegradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in deep sea subsurface environments are largely unknown. In order to reveal their biodiversity, sediments from 2.2 m under the bottom surface at a water depth of 3542 m were sampled on the Middle Atlantic Ridge with a gravity column sampler. The sediments were promptly enriched with either crude oil or a mixture of PAHs (naphthalene, phenanthrene and pyrene) as the sole carbon source, and further enriched with the PAH mixture mentioned above in the lab. The resulting consortia were named C2CO and C2PPN respectively. Their bacterial composition was analysed with plate cultivation, PCR-DGGE and 16S rDNA library analysis. On plates, isolates belonging to Pseudoalteromonas, Halomonas, Marinobacter, Thalassospira and Tistrella dominated the culturable populations. With PCR-DGGE, five major bands closely related to Cycloclasticus, Alteromonas, Thalassospira, Alcanivorax and Rhodospirillaceae were detected in consortium C2CO, while only one major band of Cycloclasticus was detected in consortium C2PPN. In addition, the dynamics of community structure in response to aromatic substrate alterations were examined. As a result, three ribotypes of Cycloclasticus were detected by 16S rDNA library analysis, one which played a key role in phenanthrene degradation; two Alteromonas bacteria dominated the naphthalene reselected consortium. Although bacteria of the two genera grew as the main members of the communities, none of them were isolated, probably owing to their poor cultivability. These results confirm that bacteria of Cycloclasticus are important obligate PAH degraders in marine environments, and coexist with other degrading bacteria that inhabit the deep subsurface sediment of the Atlantic. This supports the view that PAH accumulation and bioattenuation occur in remote areas consistently and continuously.",2008,Environmental Microbiology
Automatic Feature Selection via Weighted Kernels and Regularization,"Selecting important features in nonlinear kernel spaces is a difficult challenge in both classification and regression problems. This article proposes to achieve feature selection by optimizing a simple criterion: a feature-regularized loss function. Features within the kernel are weighted, and a lasso penalty is placed on these weights to encourage sparsity. This feature-regularized loss function is minimized by estimating the weights in conjunction with the coefficients of the original classification or regression problem, thereby automatically procuring a subset of important features. The algorithm, KerNel Iterative Feature Extraction (KNIFE), is applicable to a wide variety of kernels and high-dimensional kernel problems. In addition, a modification of KNIFE gives a computationally attractive method for graphically depicting nonlinear relationships between features by estimating their feature weights over a range of regularization parameters. The utility of KNIFE in selecting features through simulati...",2013,Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics

Purpose 
The purpose of this thesis is to empirically explore the depth and complexity of how consumers negotiate their identity project in a digital culture through images with publicity as a dimension. 
 
Methodology 
As the researchers are taking an existential-phenomenological and a pragmatic approach, the focus lies on social actions and lived experiences on Instagram. This was conducted through in-depth semi-structured interviews and photo-elicitation. 
 
Theoretical perspective 
We have looked at theories within the fields of Consumer Culture Theory where we bridge the literature of Symbolic interactionism, Postmodernism and Identity and Personal Branding in a Digital Culture. 
 
Empirical findings 
The empirical findings showed how consumers in a digital culture act as billboards and brand managers, since they strategically manage their personal brand to receive confirmation and publicity in forms of likes. The consumers strive to show themselves in a favourable way by sharing positive and interesting events. This has created fabricated images and consumers experience difficulties to find true identities on Instagram. 
 
Conclusions 
Among the participants, we could see a greater need to seek publicity value through their own personal brand both through temporary interactions and from friends. Consumers modify their identity by creating fabricated images on Instagram. This has led to a one-dimension where everyone seems to have perfect lives. Consequently, this brings anxiety, pressure and competition.",2017,

Bayesian model-averaged regularization for Gaussian graphical models,"ABSTRACT The graphical lasso has now become a useful tool to estimate high-dimensional Gaussian graphical models, but its practical applications suffer from the problem of choosing regularization parameters in a data-dependent way. In this article, we propose a model-averaged method for estimating sparse inverse covariance matrices for Gaussian graphical models. We consider the graphical lasso regularization path as the model space for Bayesian model averaging and use Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques for the regularization path point selection. Numerical performance of our method is investigated using both simulated and real datasets, in comparison with some state-of-art model selection procedures.",2017,Communications in Statistics - Simulation and Computation

Vier metamorphe Zonen folgen aufeinander: Biotit-Zone, Staurolith-Andalusit-Cordierit-Zone, Andalusit-Cordierit-Zone und Cordierit-Sillimanit-Zone. Diese Zoneneinteilung stellt eine progressiv metamorphe Reihenfolge dar, wobei jede hÃ¶her metamorphe Zone durch die weniger metamorphen Zonen gewandert ist. Auch innerhalb einer Zone kann noch eine weitere Unterteilung nach der Kristallisationsfolge gemacht werden.Die beschriebenen Mineralassoziationen sind unter niedrigen hydrostatischen DruckverhÃ¤ltnissen entstanden. Sie werden in der Amphibolit-Fazies, und zwar in einer niedrigen Druck-Faziesgruppe untergebracht. Der geothermale Gradient ist ungefÃ¤hr 15Â° C pro 100 Meter gewesen.AbstractA method to demonstrate the simultaneous development of different minerals is discussed. Minerals are contemporaneous when they have formed before and after a point in time. Points in time are supplied by phases of deformation. The relations between deformation and crystallization can be deduced from the internal and external structures of porphyroblasts and matrix.This method is applied to unravel the metamorphic history of the Bosost area. Four metamorphic zones succeed one another: the biotite-zone, stauroliteandalusite-cordierite-zone, andalusite-cordierite-zone and cordierite-sillimanitezone. This zonal distribution represents a progressive metamorphic series and each higher metamorphic zone has passed through one or more lower metamorphic zones. Even within one zone a further subdivision of the crystallization history can be made.The described mineral associations are the result of low pressure metamorphism. They can be assigned to a low pressure faciesgroup of the amphibolite facies. The geothermal gradient during metamorphism was approximately 15Â° C pro 100 meter.RÃ©sumÃ©Une mÃ©thode pour dÃ©montrer la croissance simultanÃ©e de minÃ©raux diffÃ©rents est discutÃ©e.

A mixed-species yield model for eastern Bering Sea shelf flatfish fisheries,"A variety of eastern Bering Sea (EBS) flatfish including yellowfin sole (Limanda aspera), rock sole (Lepidopsetta bilineata), flathead sole (Hippoglossoides elassodon), and Alaska plaice (Pleuronectes quadrituberculatus), co-occur in various degrees in EBS trawl fisheries, impeding attempts to obtain single-species management targets. A further complication is the bycatch of Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis); halibut bycatch limits, rather than single-species catch quotas, have been the primary factor regulating EBS flatfish harvest in recent years. To examine bycatch interactions among the EBS flatfish listed above, an equilibrium mixed-species multifishery model was developed. Equilibrium yield curves, scaled by recent average recruitment, are flat topped or asymptotically increasing, reflecting low fishing selectivity during the first several years of life and low growth relative to natural mortality. A linear programming analysis indicated that relaxation of the halibut bycatch constraint at t...",2002,Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences
Substanzbezogene StÃ¶rungen,"ZusammenfassungHintergrundAlkohol- und substanzmittelassoziierte StÃ¶rungen (ASUD) gehÃ¶ren zur hÃ¤ufigsten KomorbiditÃ¤t bei schizophrenen und affektiven StÃ¶rungsbildern und haben einen signifikanten negativen Einfluss auf deren Verlauf und Prognose. In der vorliegenden Studie wurden in einer multizentrischen Querschnittserhebung an 9 baden-wÃ¼rttembergischen KrankenhÃ¤usern fÃ¼r Psychiatrie und Psychotherapie Patienten mit einer Diagnose aus der ICD-10-Kategorie F2 oder F3 bezÃ¼glich eines Substanzmittelkonsums untersucht. Ziel dieser Arbeit ist es, PrÃ¤valenz und Charakteristika der ASUD an einer deutschen Stichprobe zu erheben und anhand der Ergebnisse den aktuellen Forschungsstand zu den theoretischen Konzepten der KomorbiditÃ¤t von Sucht und F2-/F3-Diagnosen zu diskutieren.MethodeSoziodemographische und krankheitsrelevante Daten wurden bei 50 konsekutiv aufgenommenen Patienten pro Zentrum mit einer verkÃ¼rzten Version des EuropASI erhoben, die Aussagen zum aktuellen Drogenkonsum wurden mit einem Urin-Drogenscreening objektiviert. Neben korrelativen Analysen dienten Regressionsanalysen zur Untersuchung prÃ¤diktiver Variablen fÃ¼r einen Substanzkonsum.ErgebnisseDie Stichprobe umfasste 448Â Patienten, Doppeldiagnosen aus den ICD-Klassifikationen F2x und F1x wiesen 169Â Patienten (37,7%) und mit den Klassifikationen F3x und F1x 144Â Patienten (32,1%) auf. 64Â Patienten (14,3%) hatten eine F2-Diagnose und 71Â Patienten (15,8%) eine F3-Diagnose jeweils ohne ASUD. Neben Alkohol (nâ€‰=â€‰268) und Tabak (nâ€‰=â€‰325) wurden verordnete und nichtverordnete Hypnotika/Tranquilizer (nâ€‰=â€‰214), Cannabis (nâ€‰=â€‰156), Psychostimulanzien (nâ€‰=â€‰96), Opiate (nâ€‰=â€‰71) und Halluzinogene (nâ€‰=â€‰36) konsumiert. Die hÃ¤ufigste Kombination und lÃ¤ngste Einnahmedauer umfassen anamnestisch und aktuell Tabak, Alkohol, Hypnotika/Tranquilizer, Cannabis und Psychostimulanzien vor allem bei MÃ¤nnern mit schizophrenen StÃ¶rungen. Hinsichtlich der Motivation vor Erstkonsum standen allgemeine psychische AnpassungsstÃ¶rungen (51%), Peer-EinflÃ¼sse (42%) und unspezifische affektive Symptome im Vordergrund. Patienten mit schizophrenen und affektiven Erkrankungen mit komorbidem ASUD leiden signifikant hÃ¤ufiger unter substanzmittelassoziierten StÃ¶rungen im familiÃ¤ren Umfeld und suizidaler GefÃ¤hrdung als Patienten ohne Substanzmissbrauch.SchlussfolgerungDie im Querschnitt erfassten hohen PrÃ¤valenzwerte und die Bedeutung des Konsums von Nikotin, Alkohol sowie von Cannabis und Psychostimulanzien bei Patienten mit F2- und F3-Diagnosen erfordern effektivere prÃ¤ventive und stÃ¶rungsspezifische therapeutische MaÃŸnamen.SummaryBackgroundAlcohol and substance use disorders (ASUD) are considered to be among the most frequent comorbidities in schizophrenic and affective psychoses and have a significant negative influence on their course and prognosis. In the present study patients with diagnosis from the ICD-10 category F2 or F3 were examined regarding a substance use disorder in a multicentre cross-section evaluation at nine psychiatric hospitals in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg. The aim of this study is to discuss the current research on substance use disorders and psychosis comorbidity regarding the theoretical models by means of collected data.MethodsThe examination of 50 consecutive admissions per centre is based on a shortened version of the European Severity Index (Europ ASI). An initial urine drug screening was carried out with all patients after admission. Statistical assessment was based on percentage distributions, mean values, standard deviations and suitable correlation analysis.ResultsThe representative sample included 448 patients. A proportion of 169 patients (37.7%) had a dual diagnosis F2 and F1 and a proportion of 144 patients (32.1%) had a dual diagnosis F3 and F1; 64 patients (14.3%) had an F2 diagnosis and 71 patients (15.8%) had an F3 diagnosis without ASUD. Apart from lifetime use of alcohol (nâ€‰=â€‰268) and tobacco (nâ€‰=â€‰325) hypnotics/tranquilizers (nâ€‰=â€‰214), cannabis (nâ€‰=â€‰156), opioids (nâ€‰=â€‰71), stimulants (nâ€‰=â€‰96) and hallucinogens (nâ€‰=â€‰36) were consumed. The most frequent combination and long-term intake consisted of tobacco, alcohol, hypnotics/tranquilizer, cannabis and psychostimulants especially in men with schizophrenic disorders. Regarding motivation before first substance use general psychological adjustment disorders (51%), peer impact (42%) and unspecific affective symptoms were predominant.ConclusionsAltogether the present study clearly demonstrates that patients suffering from schizophrenia, affective disorders and ASUD have significantly higher rates of more severe substance use disorders in their psychosocial environment and more suicidal behaviour than patients without substance misuse. The high rate in the cross-sectional prevalence of tobacco, alcohol, cannabis and psychostimulant use calls for more effective drug prevention.",2011,Der Nervenarzt
Supervised Learning Models,"The main objective of this chapter is to discuss various supervised learning models in detail. The supervised learning models provide parametrized mapping that projects a data domain into a response set, and thus helps extract knowledge (known) from data (unknown). These learning models, in simple form, can be grouped into predictive models and classification models. Firstly, the predictive models, such as the standard regression, ridge regression, lasso regression, and elastic-net regression are discussed in detail with their mathematical and visual interpretations using simple examples. Secondly, the classification models are discussed and grouped into three models: mathematical models, hierarchical models, and layered models. Also discussed are the mathematical models, such as the logistic regression and support vector machine; the hierarchical models, like the decision tree and the random forest; and the layered models, like the deep learning. They are discussed only from the modeling point of view, and they will be discussed in detail together as the modeling and algorithms in separate chapters later in the book.",2016,
Determination of the optical properties of Intralipid 20% over a broadband spectrum,"The aim of this study is to characterize the optical properties of Intralipid20% using two methods modified Kubelka-Munk model and Mie theory and to test the applicability of a modified Kubelka-Munk model with a single integrating sphere system over a wide wavelength range 470 â€“ 725nm. Scattering coefficients which estimated by these two methods were matched and the absorption effect was observed and quantified. Finally, the imaginary part of the refractive index was estimated besides scattering, absorption and anisotropy coefficients. Full Text: PDF References B.W. Pogue, and M.S.

Inhibitionen im neuromuskulÃ¤ren Reflexbogen als ein Faktor fÃ¼r rezidivierende Sportverletzungen und Ãœberlastungsfolgen,"ZusammenfassungDie manuelle Muskeltestung kann Ã¼ber die Bestimmung leistungsphysiologischer Parameter hinaus einen wertvollen Beitrag zu einer ursachenbezogenen Diagnostik von StÃ¶rungen bzw.Verletzungen am StÃ¼tz- und Bewegungsapparat liefern.Aus einer funktionellen Betrachtungsweise heraus steht die Muskulatur am Ende einer Reaktionskette und muss den Zustand ihrer â€œVersorgerâ€ reflektieren. G. J.Goodheart zeigte vor rund 40 Jahren erstmals, dass sich die QualitÃ¤t der reaktiven Kontraktionseigenschaften (Î³-Motorik) bestimmter Muskeln durch Behandlung funktionell mit ihr verbundener Organsysteme verÃ¤ndern lÃ¤sst.Eine FunktionseinschrÃ¤nkung dieser reaktiven Muskelansteuerung fÃ¼hrt zu defizitÃ¤ren Reaktionen gegenÃ¼ber Ã¤uÃŸeren KrÃ¤ften und stellt damit ein Verletzungsrisiko dar. In Anbetracht der groÃŸen HÃ¤ufigkeit muskelassoziierter Verletzungen wird die Eignung der gegenwÃ¤rtig zur VerfÃ¼gung stehenden Methoden zur manuellen Muskeltestung diskutiert.Im Rahmen einer Weiterentwicklung der Methode von Lovett et al. wird,unter Beachtung typischer Verletzungsmechanismen, nicht die absolute Kraft, sondern die Funktion des Reflexbogens des entsprechenden Muskels geprÃ¼ft. Die Kenntnis der jeweiligen Muskel-Gelenk-Organ-Assoziation ermÃ¶glicht RÃ¼ckschlÃ¼sse auf die Ursache der muskulÃ¤ren Fehlfunktion.SummaryAdditional to determination of force parameters the manual muscle testing is a contribution to causal diagnostics of the human motion system.In the view of physiology the muscles stand at the end of a functional chain and therefore they have to reflect the condition of their â€œsupplierâ€. G. J.Goodheart has demonstrated in 1964 for the first time, that the quality of reactive contractionability (Î³-system) of several muscles is possible to modify by treatment of the associated organ. Dysfunction of this reactive muscle control mechanism leads to a deficient reaction against outer forces and means a risk for injuries. Considering the high frequency of injuries induced by muscular dysfunctions the suitability of the present methods of manual muscle testing will discussed. In frame of a further development of Lovett's method it will be tested not only the strength, but especially the function of the reflex arch of the muscle.The knowledge of the respective muscle-organ-joint-association makes it possible to get conclusions about the cause of the muscular dysfunction.",2003,Manuelle Medizin
"The Genus Vitis L . ( Vitaceae ) in Campania ( Southern Italy ) , with Emphasis on Alien Units","In the present paper, based on field, herbarium and bibliographic research, an update concerning the genus Vitis in Campania is presented. Five taxa, including three species and two nothospecies, are recorded. Vitis labrusca (casual), Vitis riparia (casual), Vitis Ã—instabilis (casual) and Vitis Ã—koberi (naturalized) are reported for the first time in this region. The agricultural activities and artificial green areas are confirmed as starting points for the process of invasion of alien plants in southern Italy. KeywoRdS: alien SpecieS; floRiStic RecoRdS; GRapevineS; nothotaxa; vaSculaR floRa NOTES 108 Stinca a. / Ann. Bot.

However, for some areas little is known about their distribution or their invasiveness. Although the grapevines has been cultivated in Campania since the 4th century BC by the Etruscans with the techniques named â€œpiantataâ€ and â€œalberataâ€ (Buono & Vallariello, 2003), the occurrence of spontaneous taxa of Vitis across its territory appears sporadic. In fact, in this region only V. vinifera was reported (Bartolucci et al., 2018; Galasso et al., 2018). The aim of this paper is to update the geographical distribution of the taxa within the genus Vitis occurring in Campania, reporting for the first time the presence of alien units and their invasion status, and thereby contributing to the knowledge of this still under-investigated genus of vascular plants. Material and methods The present study is based on fieldwork carried out from 2011 to 2018, as well as herbaria (PORUN, according to Thiers, 2019) and literature surveys. Collected plant material was deposited in the Herbarium Porticense (PORUN-Herb. Stinca). The species are arranged in alphabetical order and nomenclature follows Bartolucci et al. (2018) and Galasso et al. (2018). The collected specimens were identified according to Ardenghi et al. (2014, 2015a, 2015b) and Ardenghi (2016). For each taxon the following information is provided: currently accepted name; main synonyms; reasons for it being recorded; regional distribution; habitat; presence status (native or alien) and current invasiveness status in Campania (assessed by population monitoring over time according to the terminology of PyÅ¡ek et al. [2004] and adapted by Galasso et al. [2018]) for the exotic units; occurrence in Italy; any additional notes; examined herbarium materials (exsiccata) arranged by province and collection date, with details (in Italian, according to the information on the specimen label data) about the location, E and N coordinates (UTM, datum WGS84), growth environments, altitude, collection date, collector(s) (legit), author(s) of the identification (determinavit) and the identity confirmation (confirmavit), and herbarium storage code.

Notes. Pignatti (1982) reported Vitis labrusca in all Italian regions as â€œcultivated and rarely subspontaneousâ€. The generic indication for Campania by Conti et al. (2005) may well be based on Pignattiâ€™s note. Subsequently the species was excluded from the regional flora (Conti et al., 2007; Celesti-Grapow et al., 2009; Pignatti, 2017; Galasso et al. 2018) since it was only known as cultivated in the region.

modellazione fisica di onde di collasso mediante stampa 3D = physical modeling of dambreak by 3D printing,"Determinare il comportamento dellâ€™onda dovuta al collasso improvviso del corpo diga (onda di dam break) e un argomento che desta tuttâ€™oggi molte interpretazioni e non risulta facile il calcolo di una soluzione, in quanto il carattere tridimensionale e variabile nel tempo, unito a forti curvature del flusso nel tratto inziale, comporta notevoli difficolta nellâ€™individuazione di soluzioni analitiche e numeriche adeguate. Per tentare di avere una soluzione il piu possibile vicina alla realta si realizzano dei modelli fisici equivalenti che presentino le stesse caratteristiche idrodinamiche e che quindi possa simulare lâ€™evento. La costruzione di tali modelli tuttavia, risulta dispendiosa e si necessita uno spazio adeguato allâ€™edificazione dellâ€™opera. Si tenta di conseguenza di trovare un metodo alternativo che impieghi meno denaro e riduca i tempi di costruzione. Per far cio si utilizza la stampante 3D con lâ€™obiettivo di riuscire a stampare dei modelli in scala molto ridotta sui quali applicare le simulazioni di dam-break. Si sono effettuate le stampe di due modelli in due scale differenti, 1:1000 e 1:2000, del comune di Montalto Dora (To), paese sotteso al bacino del Lago Pistono. Ognuna delle stampe e composta da sei quadranti in PLA. Inoltre, avendo i dati batimetrici si e prodotto anche il lago in questione in modo da avere un serbatoio il piu simile possibile allâ€™originale.

In the Art of the Tiepolo a Single Gesture Is Often Equivalent to a Long Sentence,"In his treatise on the origin of human knowledge, Ã‰tienne Bonnot de Condillac states that â€œa single gesture is often equivalent to a long sentenceâ€ (II,I,Â§51). This expression of semantic holism became an important notion in the eighteenth century and applies to the art of his contemporaries Giambattista and Domenico Tiepolo. Their powerful rhetoric constructs richly layered images often using a single symbol to import a variety of meaningsâ€”albeit frequently left to the viewer to interpret. Three recent studies, in very different ways, attest to the layering of meaning in the art of the Tiepolo. Roberto Calasso approaches Giambattistaâ€™s symbols through a nineteenth-century literary lens; Jon seydl offers a new opportunity to view his oil sketches within their own context; and the publication by adelheid Gealt and George Knox reveals the deeply spiritual dimension in the religious art of Domenico.",2007,Eighteenth-Century Studies
Sparse seasonal and periodic vector autoregressive modeling,"Seasonal and periodic vector autoregressions are two common approaches to modeling vector time series exhibiting cyclical variations. The total number of parameters in these models increases rapidly with the dimension and order of the model, making it difficult to interpret the model and questioning the stability of the parameter estimates. To address these and other issues, two methodologies for sparse modeling are presented in this work: first, based on regularization involving adaptive lasso and, second, extending the approach of Davis et al.

The methods are shown to work well on simulated data, and to perform well on several examples of real vector time series exhibiting cyclical variations.",2017,Comput. Stat. Data Anal.
Investigating the determinants of timing of first childbirth among women of the reproductive age In Mozambique,"This study is aimed at investigating the determinants of timing of first childbirth among women of the reproductive age (15-49) in Mozambique. The response variable is age at first childbirth which is defined as the age, in years, at which a woman gives birth to her first child. The cross-sectional dataset used in this study was obtained from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) Program 2011 and contains a total of 22 357 women. Survival analysis was used to model the determinants of age at first childbirth. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used during exploratory data analysis to come up with some descriptive statistics while the proportional hazards (PH) model was used to model the timing of first childbirth at 5% level of significance. Prior to fitting the multivariate Cox PH model, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method was used for variable selection. The factors that were found to have an effect on age at first childbirth were educational attainment of a women, region of residence, religion and ethnicity, the knowledge of contraceptive use and the age at which the woman first engaged in sexual intercourse. The logistic regression model was used to model pregnancy outcome and stepwise method was used for variable selection. The results showed that variables like smoking, working and knowledge of contraceptive use among women of the reproductive age had a positive effect on the response while age at first sexual intercourse had a negative effect on pregnancy outcome. Other factors that had an effect on pregnancy outcome were region of residence, womanâ€™s wealth index and educational attainment. Womanâ€™s marital status and age at which she had given birth to her first child were not related to pregnancy termination. The researcher thus recommends the government of Mozambique to implement policies and programs that seek to increase educational opportunities, especially for the girl child, so as to reduce the cases of early age at first childbirth. Pregnant women are also encouraged not to smoke or do strenuous jobs as these can increase the risk of pregnancy termination as a result of spontaneous abortions or miscarriages",2019,
Systematic identification of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulations in human respiratory epithelial cells during influenza A virus infection,"BackgroundRespiratory epithelial cells are the primary target of influenza virus infection in human. However, the molecular mechanisms of airway epithelial cell responses to viral infection are not fully understood. Revealing genome-wide transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory relationships can further advance our understanding of this problem, which motivates the development of novel and more efficient computational methods to simultaneously infer the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory networks.ResultsHere we propose a novel framework named SITPR to investigate the interactions among transcription factors (TFs), microRNAs (miRNAs) and target genes. Briefly, a background regulatory network on a genome-wide scale (~23,000 nodes and ~370,000 potential interactions) is constructed from curated knowledge and algorithm predictions, to which the identification of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory relationships is anchored. To reduce the dimension of the associated computing problem down to an affordable size, several topological and data-based approaches are used. Furthermore, we propose the constrained LASSO formulation and combine it with the dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) model to identify the activated regulatory relationships from time-course expression data. Our simulation studies on networks of different sizes suggest that the proposed framework can effectively determine the genuine regulations among TFs, miRNAs and target genes; also, we compare SITPR with several selected state-of-the-art algorithms to further evaluate its performance. By applying the SITPR framework to mRNA and miRNA expression data generated from human lung epithelial A549 cells in response to A/Mexico/InDRE4487/2009 (H1N1) virus infection, we are able to detect the activated transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory relationships as well as the significant regulatory motifs.ConclusionCompared with other representative state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed SITPR framework can more effectively identify the activated transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulations simultaneously from a given background network. The idea of SITPR is generally applicable to the analysis of gene regulatory networks in human cells. The results obtained for human respiratory epithelial cells suggest the importance of the transcriptional, post-transcriptional regulations as well as their synergies in the innate immune responses against IAV infection.",2014,BMC Bioinformatics
On robust width property for Lasso and Dantzig selector,"Recently, Cahill and Mixon completely characterized the sensing operators in many compressed sensing instances with a robust width property. The proposed property allows uniformly stable and robust reconstruction of certain solutions from an underdetermined linear system via convex optimization. However, their theory does not cover the Lasso and Dantzig selector models, both of which are popular alternatives in the statistics community. In this letter, we show that the robust width property can be perfectly applied to these two models as well. Our results solve an open problem left by Cahill and Mixon.",2015,ArXiv
Differential network analysis from cross-platform gene expression data,"Understanding how the structure of gene dependency network changes between two patient-specific groups is an important task for genomic research. Although many computational approaches have been proposed to undertake this task, most of them estimate correlation networks from group-specific gene expression data independently without considering the common structure shared between different groups. In addition, with the development of high-throughput technologies, we can collect gene expression profiles of same patients from multiple platforms. Therefore, inferring differential networks by considering cross-platform gene expression profiles will improve the reliability of network inference. We introduce a two dimensional joint graphical lasso (TDJGL) model to simultaneously estimate group-specific gene dependency networks from gene expression profiles collected from different platforms and infer differential networks. TDJGL can borrow strength across different patient groups and data platforms to improve the accuracy of estimated networks. Simulation studies demonstrate that TDJGL provides more accurate estimates of gene networks and differential networks than previous competing approaches. We apply TDJGL to the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in ovarian tumors to build differential networks associated with platinum resistance. The hub genes of our inferred differential networks are significantly enriched with known platinum resistance-related genes and include potential platinum resistance-related genes.",2016,Scientific Reports
Genomic prediction for beef fatty acid profile in Nellore cattle.,"The objective of this study was to compare SNP-BLUP, BayesCÏ€, BayesC and Bayesian Lasso methodologies to predict the direct genomic value for saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acid profile, omega 3 and 6 in the Longissimus thoracis muscle of Nellore cattle finished in feedlot. A total of 963 Nellore bulls with phenotype for fatty acid profiles, were genotyped using the Illumina BovineHD BeadChip (Illumina, San Diego, CA) with 777,962 SNP. The predictive ability was evaluated using cross validation. To compare the methodologies, the correlation between DGV and pseudo-phenotypes was calculated. The accuracy varied from -0.40 to 0.62. Our results indicate that none of the methods excelled in terms of accuracy, however, the SNP-BLUP method allows obtaining less biased genomic evaluations, thereby; this method is more feasible when taking into account the analyses' operating cost. Despite the lowest bias observed for EBV, the adjusted phenotype is the preferred pseudophenotype considering the genomic prediction accuracies regarding the context of the present study.",2017,Meat science
Stable feature selection for clinical prediction: Exploiting ICD tree structure using Tree-Lasso,"Modern healthcare is getting reshaped by growing Electronic Medical Records (EMR). Recently, these records have been shown of great value towards building clinical prediction models. In EMR data, patients' diseases and hospital interventions are captured through a set of diagnoses and procedures codes. These codes are usually represented in a tree form (e.g. ICD-10 tree) and the codes within a tree branch may be highly correlated. These codes can be used as features to build a prediction model and an appropriate feature selection can inform a clinician about important risk factors for a disease. Traditional feature selection methods (e.g. Information Gain, T-test, etc.) consider each variable independently and usually end up having a long feature list. Recently, Lasso and related l1-penalty based feature selection methods have become popular due to their joint feature selection property. However, Lasso is known to have problems of selecting one feature of many correlated features randomly. This hinders the clinicians to arrive at a stable feature set, which is crucial for clinical decision making process. In this paper, we solve this problem by using a recently proposed Tree-Lasso model. Since, the stability behavior of Tree-Lasso is not well understood, we study the stability behavior of Tree-Lasso and compare it with other feature selection methods. Using a synthetic and two real-world datasets (Cancer and Acute Myocardial Infarction), we show that Tree-Lasso based feature selection is significantly more stable than Lasso and comparable to other methods e.g. Information Gain, ReliefF and T-test. We further show that, using different types of classifiers such as logistic regression, naive Bayes, support vector machines, decision trees and Random Forest, the classification performance of Tree-Lasso is comparable to Lasso and better than other methods. Our result has implications in identifying stable risk factors for many healthcare problems and therefore can potentially assist clinical decision making for accurate medical prognosis.",2015,Journal of biomedical informatics
A Multiple-SNP Approach for Genome-Wide Association Study of Milk Production Traits in Chinese Holstein Cattle,"The multiple-SNP analysis has been studied by many researchers, in which the effects of multiple SNPs are simultaneously estimated and tested in a multiple linear regression. The multiple-SNP association analysis usually has higher power and lower false-positive rate for detecting causative SNP(s) than single marker analysis (SMA). Several methods have been proposed to simultaneously estimate and test multiple SNP effects. In this research, a fast method called MEML (Mixed model based Expectation-Maximization Lasso algorithm) was developed for simultaneously estimate of multiple SNP effects. An improved Lasso prior was assigned to SNP effects which were estimated by searching the maximum joint posterior mode. The residual polygenic effect was included in the model to absorb many tiny SNP effects, which is treated as missing data in our EM algorithm. A series of simulation experiments were conducted to validate the proposed method, and the results showed that compared with SMMA, the new method can dramatically decrease the false-positive rate. The new method was also applied to the 50k SNP-panel dataset for genome-wide association study of milk production traits in Chinese Holstein cattle. Totally, 39 significant SNPs and their nearby 25 genes were found. The number of significant SNPs is remarkably fewer than that by SMMA which found 105 significant SNPs. Among 39 significant SNPs, 8 were also found by SMMA and several well-known QTLs or genes were confirmed again; furthermore, we also got some positional candidate gene with potential function of effecting milk production traits. These novel findings in our research should be valuable for further investigation.",2014,PLoS ONE
Embracing diversity : empowering preservice teachers for teaching gifted and talented students,"This study investigated preservice teachersâ€™ perceptions for teaching and sustaining gifted and talented students while developing, modifying and implementing activities to cater for the diverse learner. Participants were surveyed at the end of a gifted and talented education program on their perceptions to differentiate the curriculum for meeting the needs of the student (n=22). SPSS data analysis with the five-part Likert scale indicated these preservice teachers agreed or strongly agreed they had developed skills in curriculum planning (91%) with well-designed activities (96%), and lesson preparation skills (96%). They also claimed they were enthusiastic for teaching (91%) and understanding of school practices and policies (96%). However, 46% agreed they had knowledge of syllabus documents with 50% claiming an ability to provide written feedback on studentâ€™s learning. Furthermore, nearly two-thirds suggested they had educational language from the syllabus and effective student management strategies. Preservice teachers require more direction on how to cater for diversity and begin creating sustainable societies by building knowledge from direct GAT experiences. Designing diagnostic surveys associated with university coursework can be used to determine further development for specific preservice teacher development in GAT education. 
 
Preservice teachers need to create opportunities for students to realise their potential by involving cognitive challenges through a differentiated curriculum. Differentiation requires modification of four primary areas of curriculum development (Maker, 1975) content (what we teach), process (how we teach), product (what we expect the students to do or show) and learning environment (where we teach/our class culture). Ashman and Elkins (2009) and Glasson (2008) emphasise the need for preservice teachers, teachers and other professionals to be able to identify what gifted and talented (GAT) students know and how they learn in relation to effective teaching. Glasson (2008) recommends that educators keep up to date with practices in pedagogy, support, monitoring and profiling of GAT students to create an environment conducive to achieving. Oral feedback is one method to communicate to learners about their progress but has advantages and disadvantages for some students. Oral feedback provides immediate information to the student on progress and performance (Ashman & Elkins, 2009). However, preservice teachers must have clear understandings of key concepts to assist the GAT student. 
 
Implementing teaching strategies to engage innovate and extend students is valuable to the preservice teacher in focusing on GAT student learning in the classroom (Killen, 2007). Practical teaching strategies (Harris & Hemming, 2008; Tomlinson et al., 1994) facilitate diverse ways for assisting GAT students to achieve learning outcomes. Such strategies include activities to enhance creativity, co-operative learning and problem-solving activities (Chessman, 2005; NSW Department of Education and Training, 2004; Taylor & Milton, 2006) for GAT students to develop a sense of identity, belonging and self esteem towards becoming an autonomous learner. Preservice teachers need to understand that GAT students learn in a different way and therefore should be assessed differently. Assessment can be through diverse options to demonstrate the studentâ€™s competence, demonstrate their understanding of the material in a way that highlights their natural abilities (Glasson, 2008; Mack, 2008). Preservice teachers often are unprepared to assess students understanding but this may be overcome with teacher education training promoting effective communication and collaboration in the classroom, including the provision of a variety of assessment strategies to improve teaching and learning (Callahan et al., 2003; Tomlinson et al., 1994). It is also critical that preservice teachers have enthusiasm for teaching to demonstrate inclusion, involvement and the excitement to communicate to GAT students in the learning process (Baum, 2002). 
 
Evaluating and reflecting on teaching practices must be part of a preservice teacherâ€™s repertoire for GAT education. Evaluating teaching practices can assist to further enhance student learning (Mayer, 2008). Evaluation gauges the success or otherwise of specific activities and teaching in general (Mayer, 2008), and ensures that preservice teachers and teachers are well prepared and maintain their commitment to their students and the community. Long and Harris (1999) advocate that reflective practices assist teachers in creating improvements in educational practices. Reflective practices help preservice teachers and teachers to improve their ability to pursue improved learning outcomes and professional growth (Long & Harris, 1999). 
 
Context 
This study is set at a small regional campus of a large university in Queensland. As a way to address departmental policies and the need to prepare preservice teachers for engaging a diverse range of learners (see Queensland College of Teachers, Professional Standards for Teachers, 2006), preservice teachers at this campus completed four elective units within their Bachelor of Education (primary) degree. The electives include: 
1. Middle years students and schools 
2. Teaching strategies for engaging learners 
3. Teaching students with learning difficulties, and 
4. Middle-years curriculum, pedagogy and assessment. 
 
In the university-based component of this unit, preservice teachers engaged in learning about middle years students and schools, and gained knowledge of government policies pertaining to GAT students. Further explored within in this unit was the importance of: collaboration between teachers, parents/carers and school personnel in supporting middle years GAT students; incorporating challenging learning experiences that promoted higher order thinking and problem solving skills; real world learning experiences for students and; the alignment and design of curriculum, pedagogy and assessment that is relevant to the students development, interests and needs. The participants were third-year Bachelor of Education (primary) preservice teachers who were completing an elective unit as part of the middle years of schooling learning with a focus on GAT students. They were assigned one student from a local school. In the six subsequent ninety minute weekly lessons, the preservice teachers were responsible for designing learning activities that would engage and extend the GAT students. Furthermore, preservice teachers made decisions about suitable pedagogical approaches and designed the assessment task to align with the curriculum and the developmental needs of their middle years GAT student. This research aims to describe preservice teachersâ€™ perceptions of their education for teaching gifted and talented students.",2010,
Exploratory graph analysis: A new approach for estimating the number of dimensions in psychological research,"The estimation of the correct number of dimensions is a long-standing problem in psychometrics. Several methods have been proposed, such as parallel analysis (PA), Kaiser-Guttman's eigenvalue-greater-than-one rule, multiple average partial procedure (MAP), the maximum-likelihood approaches that use fit indexes as BIC and EBIC and the less used and studied approach called very simple structure (VSS). In the present paper a new approach to estimate the number of dimensions will be introduced and compared via simulation to the traditional techniques pointed above. The approach proposed in the current paper is called exploratory graph analysis (EGA), since it is based on the graphical lasso with the regularization parameter specified using EBIC. The number of dimensions is verified using the walktrap, a random walk algorithm used to identify communities in networks. In total, 32,000 data sets were simulated to fit known factor structures, with the data sets varying across different criteria: number of factors (2 and 4), number of items (5 and 10), sample size (100, 500, 1000 and 5000) and correlation between factors (orthogonal, .20, .50 and .70), resulting in 64 different conditions. For each condition, 500 data sets were simulated using lavaan. The result shows that the EGA performs comparable to parallel analysis, EBIC, eBIC and to Kaiser-Guttman rule in a number of situations, especially when the number of factors was two. However, EGA was the only technique able to correctly estimate the number of dimensions in the four-factor structure when the correlation between factors were .7, showing an accuracy of 100% for a sample size of 5,000 observations. Finally, the EGA was used to estimate the number of factors in a real dataset, in order to compare its performance with the other six techniques tested in the simulation study.",2017,PLoS ONE
Pulmonary vein isolation using the Rhythmia mapping system: Verification of intracardiac signals using the Orion mini-basket catheter.,"BACKGROUND
During pulmonary vein isolation (PVI), a circular lasso catheter is positioned at the junction between the left atrium (LA) and the pulmonary vein (PV) to confirm PVI. The Rhythmia mapping system uses the Orion mini-basket catheter with 64 electrodes instead of the lasso catheter. However, its feasibility to determine PVI has not been studied.


OBJECTIVE
The purpose of this study was to compare signals between the mini-basket and lasso catheters at the LA-PV junction.


METHODS
In 12 patients undergoing PVI using Rhythmia, the mini-basket and lasso catheters were placed simultaneously at the LA-PV junction for baseline and post-PVI signal assessment. Pacing from both catheters was performed to examine the presence of exit block.


RESULTS
At baseline, recordings of LA and PV potentials were concordant in all PVs. However, after PVI, concordance between the catheters was only 68%. Discordance in all cases resulted from loss of PV potentials on the lasso catheter with persistence of PV potentials on the mini-basket catheter. In 9 of 13 PVs (69%), these potentials represented true PV potentials that were exclusively recorded with the smaller and closely spaced mini-basket electrodes. In the other 4 PVs (31%), these potentials originated from neighboring structures and resulted in underestimation of PVI.


CONCLUSION
The use of the mini-basket catheter alone is sufficient to determine PVI. While it improves recording of PV potentials after incomplete ablation, it is also associated with frequent recording of ""PV-like"" potentials originating from neighboring structures. In these cases, pacing maneuvers are helpful to determine PVI and avoid excessive ablation.",2015,Heart rhythm

Exogenic uranium mineralization in the sediments of the molassoid associations in intermontane basins,"A study of uranium deposits associated with Cenozoic molassoid associations within one of the median massifs of the Alpine geosynclinal belt is presented. It was found that the early diagenetic, predominantly lean uranium mineralization is confined to the upper subaqueous parts of the sedimentary rhythms, consisting of siltstones and silt-pelites of the stagnant facies. Redistribution of uranium, with the formation of micro-concentrations and uranium-bearing carbonate nodules, probably took place under the influence of buried sedimentation waters. The concentrations of uranium have also been redistributed by the ground waters. Within the intermontane basins, there was a constant flow of water through the marginal conglomerates into all the water-bearing horizons of the thick aquifer complex. This ensured the inflow and redistribution of uranium during all the phases of the sediment and rock. In particular, during the phase of diagenesis, more complex and richer orebodies evidently formed in the zones where the limonitization thins out. The principal source of granite during the period of humid environment was decomposing granites. During periods of arid climate, the primary concentrations of uranium developed from the precipitation of a high evaporative concentration from the waters. (JMT)",1981,International Geology Review
1130-225 New simplified technique for 3-D mapping and ablation of right ventricular outflow tachycardia,"Background: Mapping and successful catheter ablation (ABL) of arrhythmias originating from the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) requires 3-D localization in the vertical and horizontal plane. The most efficient mapping technique remains to be determined. Methods: Catheter ABL for RVOT ventricular tachycardia (n=12) or premature ventricular beats (n=8) was performed in 20 cases (18 patients, age 40Â±15 years, 6 males). In group 1 (n=6), mapping was performed with a single ABL catheter and fluoroscopy. In group 2 (n=8), 3-D mapping using a non-contact mapping system (Endocardial Solutions, n=7) or the Biosense electroanatomic system (n=1) was performed. In group 3 (n=6), 3-D mapping was performed with a circular multielectrode catheter (Lasso-n=5; Halo-n=1). The Lasso catheter was advanced into the RVOT and its cranio-caudal position was optimized to the earliest set of endocardial activation times identified on the Lasso during the arrhythmia. At that level, endocardial activation times were simultaneously evaluated on the circular catheter in the anterior, septal, posterior, or lateral plane. Based on this map, the ABL catheter was directed toward the Lasso electrodes with the earliest endocardial activation times. Further mapping in this area was done with the ABL catheter. All ablations were with 4 mm tip catheters and used radiofrequency energy. Results: The mean Â±SD fluoroscopy time (minutes) was 71Â± 37, 55Â±18 and 39Â±13 for groups 1, 2 and 3 p<0.1 by ANOVA, p<0.03 group 1 vs. 3 by Fisherâ€™s. In group 2, there were 2 tamponades, one prior to attempted ABL. In group 3, the Lasso became entrapped in the tricuspid valve requiring surgery in 1 patient in whom catheter ABL was not performed. Subsequent cases were done positioning the Lasso via a long SR0 sheath positioned across the valve. The acute success rate was 8/8 (100%), 5/7 (71%), and 5/5 (100%) for groups 1, 2 and 3. The mean Â±SD # of ABL lesions was 16.7 Â±7.9, 13.7 Â±8.3 and 16.0 Â±28.6 for groups 1, 2 and 3 (p=0.9). The median # and range of lesions was 19.5 (5-25), 12 (4-23), and 2 (1-67). Conclusions: The use of a Lasso catheter for mapping the RVOT provides a simplified technique to perform 3-D mapping for ablation of RVOT arrhythmias.",2004,Journal of the American College of Cardiology
Exploring Outliers in Crowdsourced Ranking for QoE,"Outlier detection is a crucial part of robust evaluation for crowdsourceable assessment of Quality of Experience (QoE) and has attracted much attention in recent years. In this paper, we propose some simple and fast algorithms for outlier detection and robust QoE evaluation based on the nonconvex optimization principle. Several iterative procedures are designed with or without knowing the number of outliers in samples. Theoretical analysis is given to show that such procedures can reach statistically good estimates under mild conditions. Finally, experimental results with simulated and real-world crowdsourcing datasets show that the proposed algorithms could produce similar performance to Huber-LASSO approach in robust ranking, yet with nearly 8 or 90 times speed-up, without or with a prior knowledge on the sparsity size of outliers, respectively. Therefore the proposed methodology provides us a set of helpful tools for robust QoE evaluation with crowdsourcing data.",2017,Proceedings of the 25th ACM international conference on Multimedia
Simultaneous Variable Selection,"We propose a new method for selecting a common subset of explanatory variables where the aim is to model several response variables. The idea is a natural extension of the LASSO technique proposed by Tibshirani (1996) and is based on the (joint) residual sum of squares while constraining the parameter estimates to lie within a suitable polyhedral region. The properties of the resulting convex programming problem are analyzed for the special case of an orthonormal design. For the general case, we develop an efficient interior point algorithm. The method is illustrated on a dataset with infrared spectrometry measurements on 14 qualitatively different but correlated responses using 770 wavelengths. The aim is to select a subset of the wavelengths suitable for use as predictors for as many of the responses as possible.",2005,Technometrics
Ensembling Variable Selectors by Stability Selection for the Cox Model,"As an effective tool to build interpretive models, variable selection plays an increasingly important role in high-dimensional data analysis. It has been proven that ensemble learning can significantly improve selection accuracy, alleviate the instability of traditional selection methods, and reduce false discovery rate (FDR). Therefore, variable selection ensembles (VSEs) have gained much interest in recent years. Stability selection [1], a VSE technique based on subsampling in combination with a base algorithm like lasso, is an effective method to control FDR and to improve selection accuracy in linear regression models. In this paper, we apply it to handle variable selection problems in a Cox model. Some simulated data with various censoring rates are used to study the influence of one parameter Amin in stability selection to its performance. In the meantime, stability selection is compared with other variable selection approaches. The experimental results demonstrate its good performance.",2017,Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience
Abstract 18948: A Clinical and Biomarker Scoring System to Predict the Presence of Obstructive Peripheral Artery Disease: Results From the Catheter Sampled Blood Archive in Cardiovascular Diseases (CASABLANCA) Study,"Introduction: Simple non-invasive tools to predict the presence of obstructive peripheral artery disease (PAD) may help reduce the need for imaging or invasive diagnostic testing. Hypothesis: In a prospective cohort of patients referred for diagnostic peripheral angiography, we hypothesized that a combination of clinical variables and biomarkers would identify patients with obstructive PAD. Methods: Among 258 patients referred for diagnostic peripheral angiography, predictors of â‰¥50% stenosis in at least one peripheral vessel were identified from over fifty clinical variables and 109 biomarkers, measured in blood obtained prior to angiography. Predictive models were generated using LASSO with logistic regression. A score derived from the final model was built with the entire population, and evaluated within the same population to predict obstructive PAD. Results: The scoring system consisted of clinical variables (body-mass index, history of hypertension) and 6 biomarkers (fetuin A, interleukin 8, kidney injury molecule 1, osteopontin, T cell specific protein RANTES and Tamm Horsfall urinary glycoprotein). The score had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.76 for obstructive PAD. At optimal cut-off, the score had 63% sensitivity, 75% specificity, 84% positive predictive value (PPV) and 50% negative predictive value (NPV) for obstructive PAD. When the score was divided into low risk (score of â‰¤3/10) and high risk (score of â‰¥7/10) groups, the score had a NPV of 67% and a PPV of 100% for obstructive PAD for each subgroup respectively. An elevated score predicted revascularization within 1 year follow up (hazard ratio: 2.13; p (Figure) . Conclusion: In a prospective cohort study, we derived a clinical and biomarker score with high accuracy for predicting the presence of anatomically significant PAD.",2017,Circulation
AblaciÃ³n endocÃ¡rdica para completar ablaciÃ³n lineal epicÃ¡rdica mediante ablaciÃ³n hÃ­brida toracoscÃ³pica y percutÃ¡nea de fibrilaciÃ³n auricular persistente,"VarÃ³n de 70 aÃ±os, con antecedentes de fibrilaciÃ³n auricular refractaria a tratamiento mÃ©dico y ablaciÃ³n de venas pulmonares (VP) mediante radiofrecuencia, remitido a ablaciÃ³n hÄ±Ìbrida endocÃ¡rdica (percutÃ¡nea) y epicÃ¡rdica (toracoscÃ³pica) debido al tamaÃ±o de la aurÄ±Ìcula izquierda (AI) (AP, 50 mm). En primer lugar, se realizÃ³ una punciÃ³n transeptal y mapa electroanatÃ³mico, tras lo cual se realizÃ³ una ablaciÃ³n epicÃ¡rdica por vÄ±Ìa toracoscÃ³pica. Durante la disecciÃ³n de la regiÃ³n del techo de la VP superior derecha (en el Ã¡rea de los plexos ganglionares superiores derechos), se produjo la conversiÃ³n de la fibrilaciÃ³n auricular a ritmo sinusal. Se llevÃ³ a cabo una ablaciÃ³n lineal de la AI en la regiÃ³n del techo y posteroinferior, con un catÃ©ter bipolar (Coolrail, Atricure; West Chester, Ohio, Estados Unidos). El examen visual a nivel del antro anterior de la VP izquierda mostrÃ³ una cicatriz epicÃ¡rdica en la carina y en la localizaciÃ³n del ostium distal en la VP superior izquierda (fig. 1). Se aislÃ³ la VP superior izquierda en posiciÃ³n antral, con pinza bipolar, de manera similar a lo descrito para las venas del lado derecho (fig. 1). Se continuaron las ablaciones lineales en la regiÃ³n del techo e inferior, desde el lado izquierdo, con control visual para completar el aislamiento de la regiÃ³n posterior de la AI. DespuÃ©s de la ablaciÃ³n epicÃ¡rdica, se confirmÃ³ el aislamiento elÃ©ctrico de la VP por la ausencia de potenciales de VP mediante un catÃ©ter LASSO. Sin embargo, no se aislÃ³ la regiÃ³n posterior de la AI. La presencia de potenciales locales residuales dentro de la lesiÃ³n regiÃ³n posterior indicÃ³ ausencia de bloqueo de entrada, y el estÄ±Ìmulo de ritmo con conducciÃ³n desde la pared posterior hacia el resto de la AI confirmÃ³ la ausencia de bloqueo de salida. Posteriormente, se elaborÃ³ un mapa detallado de voltaje y activaciÃ³n endocÃ¡rdicos.

Lasso-based reverberation suppression in automatic speech Recognition,"Far-field automatic speech recognition (ASR) is challenging, mainly attributed to the high reverberation in the recordings. A novel linear sparse prediction model has been proposed to estimate and suppress reverberation. This model considers reverberation as a mixture of early and late reflections of the direct signal and estimates the late reflection with Lasso. It has been demonstrated that this approach is promising in improving perceptual intelligibility, however it is unknown if the improvement can be propagated to ASR tasks. This paper applies the Lasso-based dereverberation approach to far-field speech recognition, and shows that it can deliver significant performance improvement for ASR based on deep neural networks (DNN). Particularly, we demonstrated that an utterance-based Lasso is sufficient to obtain good performance, which is important for applying the Lasso-based dereverberation to real-time ASR systems.",2015,"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)"

Comprehensive performance indicators for road pavement condition assessment,"AbstractThe selection and use of technical parameters and performance indicators plays an essential role in the pavement management process. It is known that if more parameters are used, a more accurate evaluation of pavement condition is achieved, improving the choice of maintenance and rehabilitation interventions. However, one of the most expensive activities of the pavement management process is data collection. Accordingly, it is necessary to find a balance between the data collected and the real needs of the process. This paper presents a new approach for the development of pavement condition indicators using a machine learning algorithm named regularised regression with lasso. The present discussion is supported by a case study, which compares the proposed method with current practice for the description of the condition of a Portuguese motorway. The results suggest that the application of machine learning methods can improve the accuracy of pavement condition indicators when less data are availabl...",2018,Structure and Infrastructure Engineering
Learning Feature Nonlinearities with Non-Convex Regularized Binned Regression,"For various applications, the relations between the dependent and independent variables are highly nonlinear. Consequently, for large scale complex problems, neural networks and regression trees are commonly preferred over linear models such as Lasso. This work proposes learning the feature nonlinearities by binning feature values and finding the best fit in each quantile using non-convex regularized linear regression. The algorithm first captures the dependence between neighboring quantiles by enforcing smoothness via piecewise-constant/linear approximation and then selects a sparse subset of good features. We prove that the proposed algorithm is statistically and computationally efficient. In particular, it achieves linear rate of convergence while requiring near-minimal number of samples. Evaluations on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that algorithm is competitive with current state-of-the-art and accurately learns feature nonlinearities. Finally, we explore an interesting connection between the binning stage of our algorithm and sparse Johnson-Lindenstrauss matrices.",2017,ArXiv
Personal perspectives and contemporary trends in nutritional anthropology,"Christine Wilsonâ€™s (2002) keynote address would make anexcellent introduction to a course on nutritional anthropol-ogy. It provides an early history of the discipline, namessome of the founding parents from both the nutritionalscience and anthropological lineages, and points a directionfor future interdisciplinary research. Dr Wilson has been atthe forefront of the development of nutritional anthropologysince its inception in the 1970s and she remains an influentialscholar more than three decades later. She has shaped thediscipline with her own research publications and presenta-tions, her innovative teaching, her more than two decades aseditor for Ecology of Food and Nutrition and her organizationof national and international symposia and conferences(Lieberman, 2001).She engages scholars from many disciplines who have aninterestinfood.Becauseofherbreadthofknowledge,Ialwayslearn important historical facts when I speak with her or readher papers. For example, in this essay, I was surprised to readof the Committee on Food Habits 1940s trials with tofuacceptability(Wilson,2002).Sheclearlyengendersthegoalofthe Committee on Food Habits (1943) which was to unite thebehavioral and nutritional sciences to develop an integrativediscipline to enable scholars to understand the distal andproximate reasons for why people eat what they eat, how,where, and when (Guthe & Mead, 1943).As Dr Wilson has noted, the Council on NutritionalAnthropology, a section of the American AnthropologicalAssociation,hasrecentlycelebratedits25thAnniversary.Oneof its activities has been to publish annotated syllabi withbibliographies for nutritional anthropology courses (SNACs)(Teufel & Staten, 1991; Lieberman & Sorensen, 1997). Thepedagogical trends show both an increase in interdiscipli-nary approaches reflected in the research literature and theproblem orientation of a plethora of applied anthropologytopics with nutritional components. Sobalâ€™s commentarymakes a good case for interdisciplinary training and research(Sobal, 2002) while Booth argues for an expanded behavioralepidemiology of nutrition inclusive of psychology with atten-tion to individual as well population level data (Booth, 2002).The explicitly biocultural approach, both as a disciplinaryfocusinanthropologyandasaframeworkforinterdisciplinaryteachingandresearch,isexemplifiedintherecentcompilationof readings and commentaries by Goodman et al. (2000)NutritionalAnthropology:BioculturalPerspectivesonFoodandNutrition.A number of trends were observed in the courses contri-buted to SNAC II: Syllabi for Nutritional AnthropologyCourses(LiebermanSLieberman,1998).The45 published syllabi were from courses taught in departmentsand programs in anthropology, sociology, public health,health sciences, geography, international programs, folkloreand folk life, nutrition and dietetics. Although there wasenormous diversity in content, the shared object was â€˜â€˜tounderstand why people eat what they eat.â€™â€™Some courses focused on psychological and symbolicfactorsandtheculturalidentityinvolvedinfoodhabits.Othercourses emphasized local and global economic, sociodemo-graphic,ecologicalandpoliticalfactorsâ€”oftenwithaproblemorappliedfocussuchasfoodsecurityoralterationsinresourcebases.

Effects of electrical physical stimuli on articular cartilage.,"Articular cartilage is a hypocellular, avascular, alymphatic tissue with a dense collagen and proteoglycan matrix that provides a low-friction and highly durable wear-resistant surface1 to both shear and compressive stress.

Normal maintenance of articular cartilage results from the balance between anabolic and catabolic activity. Resident chondrocytes control the extracellular matrix turnoverâ€”collagen and proteoglycans synthesis and degradationâ€”from the tidemark to the tangential zone of the cartilage. However, little is known about the physiological processes regulating cellular turnover and cartilage homeostasis, mainly because of the large number of factors involved (mechanical load, cell density, matrix composition, growth factors, cytokines, injury, and aging) and the complexity of their interactions.

Insufficient knowledge of the physiology and homeostasis of articular cartilage greatly impairs the ability to stop or slow disease progression. It is commonly accepted that articular cartilage is a tissue with little or no regenerative potential and thus undergoes degradation over time.

The notion that it is impossible to prevent or reverse degeneration of articular cartilage has been challenged recently by the growing body of evidence in the literature based on basic-research findings concerning the physiology and pathophysiology of articular cartilage, so that new strategies for its maintenance and repair are emerging2. In two recent studies by Glasson et al.3 and Stanton et al.4, a knockout mouse model of osteoarthritis, a degenerative disease that eventually leads to destruction of articular cartilage, demonstrated how a single protein, ADAMTS 5, is the main aggrecanase responsible for cartilage degradation and the principal mediator of the catabolic effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1). Their findings identify a rational target for therapeutic intervention to limit cartilage degradation in osteoarthritis and demonstrate that interference with a single pathway can dramatically alter the natural history of joint disease.

Architecture Selection via the Trade-off Between Accuracy and Robustness,"We provide a general framework for characterizing the trade-off between accuracy and robustness in supervised learning. We propose a method and define quantities to characterize the trade-off between accuracy and robustness for a given architecture, and provide theoretical insight into the trade-off. Specifically we introduce a simple trade-off curve, define and study an influence function that captures the sensitivity, under adversarial attack, of the optima of a given loss function. We further show how adversarial training regularizes the parameters in an over-parameterized linear model, recovering the LASSO and ridge regression as special cases, which also allows us to theoretically analyze the behavior of the trade-off curve. In experiments, we demonstrate the corresponding trade-off curves of neural networks and how they vary with respect to factors such as number of layers, neurons, and across different network structures. Such information provides a useful guideline to architecture selection.",2019,ArXiv

Clinical Investigation on Spontaneous Electrical Activity of the Cardiac Veins in Patients With Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation.,"The purpose of this study is to describe the features of spontaneous electrical discharges in pulmonary veins (PV) and superior vene cava (SVC) in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation(PAF). 126 patients with refractory PAF underwent the electrophysiological study (EPS). With lasso mapping catheter in each vein during the episode of atrial tachyarrhythmias, both the potentials in the vein and the atria were simultaneously recorded. Their characteristics and the relationship between the atria potentials and the myocardial sleeves potentials were analyzed. Results: Spontaneous electrical discharges triggering or initiating atrial arrhythmias were recorded in 59 veins of 50 patients(39.7%),including 49 PVs and 10 SVCs. There were one or more patterns of discharges inside each arrhythmogenic vein, including frequent or bigeminal discharges in 38, short runs (in salvos) of discharges in 8 and continuous firing in 27. The total 23 onsets of PAF were documented,which were always preceded by short and fast atrial tachycardia or flutter-like activities driven by continuous electrical firing from veins with variable degrees of exit block. Conclusions:The target veins as arrhythmogenic triggers can be confirmed by mapping the cardiac veins with circular mapping catheter during the onsets of atrial tachyarrhythmias. The pattern of spontaneous electrical activities within the veins could be occasional one or two discharges, repetitive runs or continuous firing. The PAF in our cases are proven to be actually initiated by atrial tachycardia or flutter driven by continuous electrical firing rather than only early premature beats driven by one discharge from the PV or SVC.",2005,The Chinese Journal of Cardiac Pacing and Electrophysiology
Econometric modelling and forecasting of intraday electricity prices,In the following paper we analyse the ID$_3$-Price on German Intraday Continuous Electricity Market using an econometric time series model. A multivariate approach is conducted for hourly and quarter-hourly products separately. We estimate the model using lasso and elastic net techniques and perform an out-of-sample very short-term forecasting study. The model's performance is compared with benchmark models and is discussed in detail. Forecasting results provide new insights to the German Intraday Continuous Electricity Market regarding its efficiency and to the ID$_3$-Price behaviour.

"Informal Sector, Petty Commodity Production, and the Social Relations of Small-scale Enterprise","A persistent challenge to the understanding of Third World economies is their heterogeneity as reflected in the co-existence and combination of many varied forms of production, distribution and exchange. Of the various attempts to analyse these multi-structured economies most have described a structure of economic duality. While some social scientists (e.g. Geertz, 1963; Santos, 1975; McGee, 1973) identify two â€˜sectorsâ€™, â€˜segmentsâ€™ or â€˜circuitsâ€™, Marxist writers (Dupre and Rey, 1973; Althusser and Balibar, 1970; Terray, 1972, 1975; Godelier, 1972 and 1975; Meillassoux, 1972) stress the articulation of what they call â€˜dominantâ€™ and â€˜subordinateâ€™ modes of production as represented by the coexistence of capitalist with non-capitalist forms. This paper offers a critical review of a number of theoretical and empirical issues arising from this literature, and indicates how the analysis of multi-structured economies might be further advanced through the examination of certain dimensions that have remained only peripherally explored.",1978,
LASSO with cross-validation for genomic selection.,"We used a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) approach to estimate marker effects for genomic selection. The least angle regression (LARS) algorithm and cross-validation were used to define the best subset of markers to include in the model. The LASSO-LARS approach was tested on two data sets: a simulated data set with 5865 individuals and 6000 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs); and a mouse data set with 1885 individuals genotyped for 10 656 SNPs and phenotyped for a number of quantitative traits. In the simulated data, three approaches were used to split the reference population into training and validation subsets for cross-validation: random splitting across the whole population; random sampling of validation set from the last generation only, either within or across families. The highest accuracy was obtained by random splitting across the whole population. The accuracy of genomic estimated breeding values (GEBVs) in the candidate population obtained by LASSO-LARS was 0.89 with 156 explanatory SNPs. This value was higher than those obtained by Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (BLUP) and a Bayesian method (BayesA), which were 0.75 and 0.84, respectively. In the mouse data, 1600 individuals were randomly allocated to the reference population. The GEBVs for the remaining 285 individuals estimated by LASSO-LARS were more accurate than those obtained by BLUP and BayesA for weight at six weeks and slightly lower for growth rate and body length. It was concluded that LASSO-LARS approach is a good alternative method to estimate marker effects for genomic selection, particularly when the cost of genotyping can be reduced by using a limited subset of markers.",2009,Genetics research
Multiclass classification by sparse multinomial logistic regression,"In this paper we consider high-dimensional multiclass classification by sparse multinomial logistic regression extending the results of Abramovich and Grinshtein (2019) for the binary case. We propose a feature selection procedure based on penalized maximum likelihood with a complexity penalty on the model size and derive the nonasymptotic bounds for misclassification excess risk of the resulting classifier. We establish also their tightness by deriving the corresponding minimax lower bounds. In particular, we show that there exist two regimes corresponding to small and large number of classes. The bounds can be reduced under the additional low noise condition. Implementation of any complexity penalty based procedure, however, requires a combinatorial search over all possible models. To find a feature selection procedure computationally feasible for high-dimensional data, we propose multinomial logistic group Lasso and Slope classifiers and show that they also achieve the optimal order in the minimax sense.",2020,ArXiv
Component Selection in the Additive Regression Model,"Similar to variable selection in the linear regression model, selecting significant components in the popular additive regression model is of great interest. However, such components are unknown smooth functions of independent variables, which are unobservable. As such, some approximation is needed. In this paper, we suggest a combination of penalized regression spline approximation and group variable selection, called the lasso-type spline method (LSM), to handle this component selection problem with a diverging number of strongly correlated variables in each group. It is shown that the proposed method can select significant components and estimate nonparametric additive function components simultaneously with an optimal convergence rate simultaneously. To make the LSM stable in computation and able to adapt its estimators to the level of smoothness of the component functions, weighted power spline bases and projected weighted power spline bases are proposed. Their performance is examined by simulation studies across two set-ups with independent predictors and correlated predictors, respectively, and appears superior to the performance of competing methods. The proposed method is extended to a partial linear regression model analysis with real data, and gives reliable results.",2010,

Testing the role of heart mitochondrial stability and function in heart failure of ectotherms exposed to heat stress,"i Abstract Hearts appear to be the first organs to fail in heat stressed animals. Predictions of climate change mediated increases in ocean temperatures suggest that the ectothermic heart may place tight constraints on the diversity and distribution of marine species with cardiovascular systems. For many such species, their upper temperature limits (Tmax) and respective heart failure (HF) temperatures (THF) are only a few degrees from current environmental temperatures. While the ectothermic cardiovascular system may act as an â€˜ecological thermometerâ€™, the exact mechanism mediating HF remains unresolved. This thesis hypothesised that heat-stressed cardiac mitochondria drives HF in ectotherms and first investigated this in a common New Zealand fish Notolabrus celidotos. This thesis further tested cardiac mitochondria in wrasses from cold temperate (Notolabrus fucicola) and tropical (Thalassoma lunare) habitats to explore the effects of temperature across species from differing thermal habitats. Then, utilising N. celidotus, a speciesâ€™ capacity to acclimate cardiac mitochondria was assessed following acclimation to mean seasonal temperatures. Finally, this thesis compared the thermal tolerance of heart and cardiac mitochondrial function in native (Ovalipes catharus) and invasive (Charybdis japonica) paddle crabs to test the role of mitochondria in providing a species an ecological advantage. High resolution respirometry coupled to fluorimeters were used to assess the temperaturemediated changes in cardiac mitochondrial respiration, ROS and ATP production, and these changes were overlaid with the THF (27.8 Â± 0.4 C) of N. celidotus. Even at saturating oxygen levels, several mitochondrial components were compromised before the onset of THF suggesting that impairment of oxygen consumption by heart mitochondria preceded oxygen limitation. Importantly, the capacity to efficiently produce ATP in the heart was limited at 25 C, and this was prior to the acute THF for N. celidotus. Membrane leakiness increased significantly at 25 C, as did cytochrome c release and permeability to NADH. Maximal flux rates and the capacity for the electron transport system (ETS) to uncouple were also altered at 25 C. These data indicate that mitochondrial membrane integrity is lost, depressing ATP synthesis capacity and promoting cytochrome c release, prior to THF. It was concluded that mitochondria can mediate HF in heat stressed hearts in fish and plays a significant role in thermal stress tolerance.",2014,
Using LASSO regularization as a feature selection tool.,"The subject of deep learning has become increasingly popular, especially for machine learning applications where a large number of input variables have to be processed. However, there are instances of problem solving, where a full understanding of the variables is of high importance. When dealing with data sets containing a large number of input variables, the established methods of feature selection require a considerable time investment. Regularization is a method typically associated with prevention of overtraining, but in this study, the possibility is explored of using LASSO regularization as a feature selection tool. The input variables of several data sets were ranked with respect to a measure of synaptic weight magnitude. A conclusion was drawn that this method is a very fast and efficient way of filtering out less important variables. (Less)",2017,
Uncertainty in early warning predictions of engineering ground motion parameters: What really matters?,"[1] From the engineering perspective, the effectiveness of earthquake early warning systems (EEWS) depends only on the possibility of immediately detecting the earthquake and estimating the expected loss at a location of interest, in order to undertake actions to manage/mitigate the risk before the strike. The simplest proxy for the earthquakeâ€™s destructive potential is the peak ground acceleration (PGA), which is predicted through probabilistic seismic hazard analysis in the framework of EEW. In this paper, the effects of different sources of uncertainty on the prediction of PGA are assessed with reference to the ISNet (Irpinia Seismic Network) EEWS. First the analyses show how the uncertaintyof the ground motion prediction equation (GMPE) dominates those of magnitude and distance, almost independently of the information available for the event. Secondly, based on these findings, information-dependent lead-time maps are provided for the Campania (southern Italy) region. Finally, different real-time magnitude estimators are compared in terms of errors in the prediction of PGA, as a more efficient estimator may give additional lead-timeforriskreduction.

"Influence of Petroleum at a Refinery Terminal on Feral Winter Flounder, Pleuronectes americanus","Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), components of crude oil, contain toxic, mutagenic and carcinogenic compounds and pose a potential hazard to marine animals. PAHs have been reported to affect marine organisms and sediment appears to be a major source following spills, seeps, atmospheric deposition etc. (McElroy et al. 1989). Aquatic organisms accumulate and bioconcentrate PAHs through food and water and various effects might ensue after chronic exposure (Bender et al. 1988). Biotransformation of these xenobiotic compounds might also occur resulting in benzo-a-pyrenes which have been considered to be carcinogenic (Varanasi, and Stein 1991). Early life-stages of fish tend to be extremely susceptible (Norcross et al. 1996) whereas in older fish subtle changes such as feed intake, blood values, hepatic detoxication enzymes, primarily mixed function oxygenases (MFOs) and histopathology might occur. When high concentrations of PAHs occur in sediment, abnormalities such as skin lesions, hepatic neoplasms and altered activity of the immune system are apparent (Hargis et al. 1989; KellyReay and Weeks-Perkins 1994). Species of flatfish in the marine environment have been reported to be appropriate for biomonitoring studies because of their tendency to be non-migratory and to submerge themselves in sediment when not foraging for food (Fletcher et al. 1981; Scott and Scott 1988). Consequently, bioaccumulation of PAHs can occur following chronic exposure (Hellou et al. 1994). Haensly et al. (1982) reported histopathological abnormalities in the gills, kidney and ovary of plaice, Pleuronectes platessa, that were exposed to the Amoco Cadiz oil spill in an isolated inlet off the coast of France but Armstrong et al. (1995) found no differences in lesions in flathead sole, Hippoglossoides elassodon, from oiled and non-oiled bays two years after the Exxon Valdez oil spill in the Gulf of Alaska. These differences in results between the two oil spills might be related to isolated in contrast to open marine environments respectively.",1998,Bulletin of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology

Endangered Species Responses to Natural Habitat Declines: Nebraska's Interior Least Terns (Sternula antillarum athalassos) and Piping Plovers (Charadrius melodus) Nesting in a Human-Created Habitat,"Formerly, state and federally endangered Interior Least Terns (Sternula antillarum athalassos) and state and federally threatened Piping Plovers (Charadrius melodus) nested on sandbars in rivers, as well as on other sandy beach habitat (Hardy 1957; Haig 1992; Kirsch 1992; Ziewitz et al 1992; Thompson et al 1997). In Nebraska, the birds primarily used sandbars in the Platte, Loup, Elkhorn, Niobrara, and Missouri rivers (Sharpe et al. 2001). These sandbars were created and maintained by river flow and regular flooding events. Despite the frequent scouring, reshaping and relocation of the sandbars, nesting habitat was consistently available to the birds in these river systems. With recent human-caused modifications to annual river flow, river bed and bank structure, and emergent vegetation, the number of river sandbars that are suitable for nesting has been greatly reduced (Haig 1992; Ziewitz et al 1992; Wilson et al 1993; Thompson et al 1997; NRC 2005).",2008,
Identification of two microRNA signatures in whole blood as novel biomarkers for diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma,"BackgroundEarly diagnosis is critical to reduce the mortality caused by nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are dysregulated and play important roles in carcinogenesis. Therefore, this study aimed to identify diagnostically relevant circulating miRNA signatures in patients with NPC.MethodsTotal RNA was extracted from whole blood samples obtained from 120 patients with NPC, 30 patients with head-neck tumors (HNT), and 30 healthy subjects (HSs), and examined by using a custom microarray. The expression levels of four miRNAs identified by using the microarray were validated with quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The 120 patients with NPC and 30 HSs were randomly assigned to training group-1 and validation group-1, respectively. By using significance analysis of microarray (SAM), the specific miRNA expression profiles in whole blood from patients with NPC are obtained. By using lasso regression and adaptive boosting, a diagnostic signature was identified in training group-1, and its accuracy was verified in validation group-1. By using the same methods, another signature to distinguish patients with NPC from those with HNT and HSs was identified in training group-2 and confirmed in validation group-2.ResultsThere were 117 differentially expressed miRNAs (upregulated and downregulated fold change â‰¥â€‰1.5) between the patients with NPC and HSs, among which an 8-miRNA signature was identified with 96.43% sensitivity and 100% specificity [area under the curve (AUC)â€‰=â€‰0.995] to diagnose NPC in training group-1 and 86.11% sensitivity and 88.89% specificity (AUCâ€‰=â€‰0.941) in validation group-1. Compared with traditional Epsteinâ€“Barr virus (EBV) seromarkers, this signature was more specific for NPC. Furthermore, a 16-miRNA signature to differentiate NPC from HNT and HS (HNT-HS) was established from 164 differentially expressed miRNAs, which diagnosed NPC and HNT-HS with 100% accuracy (AUCâ€‰=â€‰1.000) in training group-2 and 87.04% (AUCâ€‰=â€‰0.924) in validation group-2.ConclusionsThe present study identified two miRNA signatures for the highly accurate diagnosis and differential diagnosis of patients with NPC from HSs and patients with HNT. The identified miRNAs might represent novel serological biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for NPC.",2019,Journal of Translational Medicine
Phase I Report on Folded Plate Construction,"The various methods of analysis of folded plates, proposed to 1963, are reviewed and summarized. First consideration goes to the simple beam theories that neglect the effect of relative joint displacement, as in the original work by Ehlers and Craemer in Germany in the 1930's, that was subsequently introduced in the United States by Winter and Pei. This report then evaluates the more exact methods of analysis correcting for relative joint displacement subsequently developed by Gruber, Vlassov, Gaafar, Simpson, and Yitzhaki. Finally, the elasticity approach of Goldberg and Leve is considered. As a result of the study, the Committee recommends the use of the ordinary theory with correction for relative joint displacements. Methods in this acceptable category include those of Vlassov, Gaafar, Gaafar as modified by Simpson, Portland Cement Association Bulletin #3, and, finally, Yitzhaki. The report summarizes a method of analysis based on Gaafar's original paper and includes a numerical example for greater clarity. The Committee has also sponsored and recommends an article on folded plate analysis by Yitzhaki. A very complete Bibliography of the subject of folded plates both in English and other languages is included.",1963,Journal of the Structural Division
Swift Linked Data Miner: Mining OWL 2 EL class expressions directly from online RDF datasets,"We present Swift Linked Data Miner, an interruptible algorithm that can directly mine an on-line Linked Data source (e.g. a SPARQL endpoint) for OWL 2 EL class expressions to extend an ontology with new SubClassOf: axioms. The algorithm works by downloading only a small part of the Linked Data source at a time, building a smart index in the memory and swiftly iterating over the index to mine axioms. We propose a transformation function from mined axioms to RDF Data Shapes. We show, by means of a crowdsourcing experiment, that most of the axioms mined by Swift Linked Data Miner are correct and can be added to an ontology. We provide a ready to use ProtÂ´egÂ´e plugin implementing the algorithm, to support ontology engineers in their daily modelling work.",2017,ArXiv
Testing the prediction error difference between 2 predictors.,"We develop an inference framework for the difference in errors between 2 prediction procedures. The 2 procedures may differ in any aspect and possibly utilize different sets of covariates. We apply training and testing on the same data set, which is accommodated by sample splitting. For each split, both procedures predict the response of the same samples, which results in paired residuals to which a signed-rank test is applied. Multiple splits result in multiple p-values. The median p-value and the mean inverse normal transformed p-value are proposed as summary (test) statistics, for which bounds on the overall type I error rate under a variety of assumptions are proven. A simulation study is performed to check type I error control of the least conservative bound. Moreover, it confirms superior power of our method with respect to a one-split approach. Our inference framework is applied to genomic survival data sets to study 2 issues: compare lasso and ridge regression and decide upon use of both methylation and gene expression markers or the latter only. The framework easily accommodates any prediction paradigm and allows comparing any 2, possibly nonmodel-based, prediction procedures.",2009,Biostatistics

Efficacy of adjuvant anterior left atrial ablation during intracardiac echocardiography-guided pulmonary vein antrum isolation for atrial fibrillation.,"BACKGROUND
Recent data have shown that the septum and anterior left atrial (LA) wall may contain ""rotor"" sites required for AF maintenance. However, whether adding ablation of such sites to standard ICE-guided PVAI improves outcome is not well known.


OBJECTIVE
To determine if adjuvant anterior LA ablation during PVAI improves the cure rate of paroxysmal and permanent AF.


METHODS
One hundred AF patients (60 paroxysmal, 40 persistent/permanent) undergoing first-time PVAI were enrolled over three months to receive adjuvant anterior LA ablation (Group I). These patients were compared with 100 randomly selected, matched first-time PVAI controls from the preceding three months who did not receive adjuvant ablation (Group II). All 200 patients underwent ICE-guided PVAI during which all four PV antra and SVC were isolated. In group I, a decapolar lasso catheter was used to map the septum and anterior LA wall during AF (induced or spontaneous) for continuous high-frequency, fractionated electrograms (CFAE). Sites where CFAE were identified were ablated until the local EGM was eliminated. A complete anterior line of block was not a requisite endpoint. Patients were followed up for 12 months. Recurrence was assessed post-PVAI by symptoms, clinic visits, and Holter at 3, 6, and 12 months. Patients also wore rhythm transmitters for the first 3 months. Recurrence was any AF/AFL >1 min occurring >2 months post-PVAI.


RESULTS
Patients (age 56 +/- 11 years, 37% female, EF 53%+/- 11%) did not differ in baseline characteristics between group I and II by design. Group I patients had longer procedure time (188 +/- 45 min vs 162 +/- 37 min) and RF duration (57 +/- 12 min vs 44 +/- 20 min) than group II (P < 0.05 for both). Overall recurrence occurred in 15/100 (15%) in group I and 20/100 (20%) in group II (P = 0.054). Success rates did not differ for paroxysmal patients between group I and II (87% vs 85%, respectively). However, for persistent/permanent patients, group I had a higher success rate compared with group II (82% vs 72%, P = 0.047).


CONCLUSIONS
Adjuvant anterior LA ablation does not appear to impact procedural outcome in patients with paroxysmal AF but may offer benefit to patients with persistent/permanent AF.",2007,Journal of cardiovascular electrophysiology
An Efficient Technique for Network Intrusion Detection Using Feature selection,"Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is one of the most significant parts of network security that can make secure transactions over a network. Despite many efforts in the field, we can observe increased sophistication and variety of attacks on networks. In such situation Machine learning (ML) based methods have emerged some of the most effective as well as popular methods to detect the attacks. One of the complexities involved in the ML-based method is that they are mostly of the black-box nature, so their inner working phenomena are very often quite complex to understand and interpret. Moreover, high-dimensional features and an inadequate number of training records have caused some problems in the classifications, such as over fitting of the results, noise sensitiveness, overload computation and lack of significant physical interoperability. In this paper, we propose a discriminative features selection and network intrusion classification by applying sparse modeling with Lasso and SVMs with two kernel functions. SVMs are standard ML techniques which can provide reasonable performance however it can have some shortcomings such as interpretability and huge computational cost. On the other hand, sparse modeling has been considered as an advanced technique for data analysis and processing via regularization. Sparse modeling can be used to simultaneously select discriminative features from the repository of the dataset. Moreover, it also determines the coefficient of the linear classifier where prior information about features structure can be mapped into various sparsity-inducing regularization such as Lasso. Furthermore, we apply sparse modeling for the multiclass-classification purpose; in this way, we can identify and select the features yielded by the network attacks that are the most significant ones. Our experimental in this correspondence suggest that the proposed techniques have better performance than most of the state-of-the-art methods.",2019,Sindh University Research Journal
1248-P: Estimating Diabetes Duration from Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) with an Intrinsic Diabetes Risk Prediction Model: From Clinical Trial to Real-World Clinical Practice,"We have previously described the utility and high predictive value of the Building, Relating, Assessing, and Validating Outcomes (BRAVO) model, which was developed from the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial data. However, it uses diabetes duration as a key factor for modelling diabetes progression, and diabetes duration is not routinely collected in EMRs. This study use machine learning to estimate diabetes duration with EMR information. Among individuals (N=8,026) with complete records from the ACCORD trial, diabetes duration was estimated with an ordinary least squares (OLS) model, a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) model, a pruned decision tree model, and a random forest model using 37 baseline predictors such as biomarkers, demographics, disease history, and medications. Model performance was compared using root-mean-square Error (RMSE), mean-absolute error (MAS), and R-squared. All three indicators were calculated through 10-fold cross-validation with 1000 iterations in order to address over-fitting. Age, current HbA1c value, retinopathy, number of oral antidiabetic drugs, number of Insulin types, and use of sulfonylureas were identified as key predictors for patient-reported diabetes duration. The random forest model achieved the best performance on all three indicators (RMSE=6.16, MAE= 4.71, R 2 =0.30), significantly higher than the pruned decision tree model (RMSE=6.57, MAE= 5.03, R 2 =0.21) and LASSO model (RMSE=6.60, MAE= 5.08, R 2 =0.20). Diabetes duration can be predicted using fields routinely included in EMRs. Integration of the results of this prediction equation into predictive diabetes models (such as BRAVO) will allow patient-specific estimates of diabetes duration based solely on EMRs. This will increase precision when inferring risk level and using models to aid clinical decision making among patients with type 2 diabetes. Disclosure H. Shao: None. S. Yang: None. C.

Robust least angle regression and LASSO using bootstrap aggregation (real case study: Iranian poultry farms),"Over the past ten years, many researchers and practitioners have concentrated on the topic of least angle regression, LASSO and forward stagewise (LARS) considerably instead of other subset selection models such as forward and backward stepwise. This model selection algorithm is useful and less greedy in comparison with traditional approaches similar forward stepwise. In this study, we present a taxonomy of all researches that pertains to LARS, and a review of this literature including extensions of it. Next, we introduce a robust LARS by applying bootstrap aggregation to reduce the variance of LARS model. For this purpose, we employ real world case of Iranian poultry farms so as to illustrate our proposed models. The results indicate the proposed hybrid model predicts more accurate compared to classic LARS algorithm. At last, we suggest opportunities for future research in this area.",2017,International Journal of Industrial and Systems Engineering
Improved Models of Mini Anion Exchange Centrifugation Technique (mAECT) and Modified Single Centrifugation (MSC) for Sleeping Sickness Diagnosis and Staging,"Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), or sleeping sickness, is caused by two subspecies of the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei (T.b.) and transmitted through tsetse flies (Glossina sp.). T.b. gambiense occurs from West to Central sub-Sahara Africa, while T.b. rhodesiense is endemic in East sub-Sahara Africa. Other closely related taxa (T.b. brucei, T. evansi, T. equiperdum, T. congolense, T. vivax) cause animal African trypanosomiases in domestic animals like cattle, horse, camel, goat, sheep, and buffalo in Africa, Latin America, Europe, and Asia [1]. 
 
Approximately 10,000 sleeping sickness patients are diagnosed and treated each year [2]. This is only a fraction of those carrying this lethal infection since (i) the population at risk lives mainly in remote areas outside the action radius of health centres or mobile teams, and (ii) the diagnostic tests suffer from limited sensitivity [3],[4]. 
 
There is a consensus to (i) only treat patients with confirmed diagnosis, i.e., in whom the parasite has been demonstrated, except in particular situations, and (ii) to examine the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for white blood cell counts and the presence of trypanosomes in order to decide which drugs to administer. To determine whether a patient is cured, examination of CSF is repeated each semester for up to 2 years [4]. 
 
In T.b. gambiense sleeping sickness, general low parasite loads necessitate the use of concentration techniques to reveal infection. Capillary tube centrifugation (CTC, WOO) [5], quantitative buffy coat (QBC) [6], and mini anion exchange centrifugation technique (mAECT) [7] are applied on blood. mAECT is the most sensitive method for trypanosome detection in blood and is based on a purification technique first described by Lanham et al. and later adapted for diagnosis of sleeping sickness and of animal infections with T. brucei and T. evansi [7]â€“[10]. In mAECT, trypanosomes are separated from 350 Âµl of blood by anion exchange chromatography on diethylaminoethyl cellulose (DEAE). Eluted trypanosomes are then concentrated by low speed centrifugation followed by direct microscopic examination of the sediment in a transparent collector tube. The large volume of blood examined allows detection of fewer than 50 trypanosomes/ml. For sensitive detection of trypanosomes in CSF, single and double centrifugation (DC) and modified single centrifugation (MSC) are applied, with MSC being easier to perform and at least as sensitive as DC [11]. 
 
For several years, mAECT was produced at the Projet de Recherches Cliniques sur la Trypanosomiase (PRCT) in Daloa, Cote d'Ivoire, with financial support from the World Health Organization (WHO), and then for some time at Institut Pierre Richet (IPR) in Bouake, Cote d'Ivoire. The PRCT model is still produced on demand in this country (B. Miezan, personal commmunication). Several attempts to establish a production unit elsewhere were discontinued. 
 
At the request of the Belgian Technical Cooperation (BTC) for the Programme National de Lutte contre la Trypanosomiase Humaine Africaine (PNLTHA) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the Institute of Tropical Medicine (ITM, Belgium) and the Institut National de Recherche Biomedicale (INRB, DRC) developed a modified version of the mAECT. With financial support from the Belgian Directorate General for Development Cooperation and WHO, production at INRB started in 2003. At the end of 2005, production stopped since raw material for the 9-mm diameter glass collector tube was not commercially available anymore. 
 
From 2006 on, with support from the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND), the column rack, microscope viewing chamber, and collector tube were redesigned. Important advantages of the new collector tube and the viewing chamber are their robustness and the fact that microscopic examination of the sediment is possible without mounting the tip of the collector tube under water (Figures 1â€“â€‹3).3). Improvements were made to the packing trays (Figure S1), filter material (Figure S2), sterilisation procedure, and instruction leaflets. In addition, the production infrastructure at INRB and the quality control system were upgraded. Actually, quality control is performed internally at INRB and externally at ITM before a batch is released. Detailed production standard operating procedures were written and are collated in an mAECT handbook that can be found on the FIND Web site [12].

In 2007, a comparison between the first model of mAECT produced at INRB and the PRCT model was carried out at the Centre International de Recherche-Developpement sur l'Elevage en zone Sub-humide (CIRDES) in Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso, on 198 columns of each model. Columns received 350 Âµl of human blood containing on average 35 T.b. gambiense trypanosomes (100 trypanosomes per ml of blood). The time to run a column was recorded and trypanosomes in each collector tube were counted by two independent observers. Averages were compared using paired t-test and showed a significantly shorter run time for the INRB than the PRCT model (29 and 42 min, respectively, p<0.0001), which is explained by the fact that in the INRB model, no glucose should be added before applying the blood. In addition, more trypanosomes were recovered by the INRB than by the PRCT model (5.85 and 4.92, respectively, p<0.005). After changing the filter material in 2008, the second INRB model was compared with the previous one by the same CIRDES experts on 195 columns of each type. The second model runs faster than the first (21 and 33 min, respectively, p<0.0001) and showed higher average trypanosome numbers (4.43 and 1.76, respectively, p<0.0001). The lower average trypanosome numbers counted with the first model compared to the previous comparison is probably caused by the still unexplained fact that the number of recovered trypanosomes seems to be blood donor dependent. 
 
The INRB mAECT kit consists of two cardboard boxes. One contains 20 mAECT columns best stored at 4Â°Câ€“8Â°C, although tests are stable for 12 months at a maximum of 37Â°C. The other contains 20 collector tubes, 20 centrifugation tubes, 20 transfer pipettes, and the instruction leaflet (available in English, French, and Portuguese). Specifications of the kit are given in Box 1. 
 
 
Box 1. Three Advantages and Three Disadvantages for the New mAECT Model 
Advantages 
 
 
Analytical sensitivity <50 trypanosomes per ml of blood at only â‚¬3 per test. 
 
 
Robustness and no need to mount collector tube in water for microscopic examination. 
 
 
Applicable in field conditions. 
 
 
 
Disadvantages 
 
 
Need for specific material and centrifuge. 
 
 
Limited stability since the glucose is now incorporated in the column buffer (maximum 1 year at 37Â°C).

In the original MSC test on CSF described by Miezan et al., 2-ml glass pasteur pipettes are used as collector tubes and are examined after mounting the tip under water [11]. With its 4 ml of volume and no need for mounting under water, the new plastic mAECT collector tube is expected to increase the sensitivity and the robustness of MSC on CSF, although a formal comparative test still has to be performed. An MSC kit for 20 tests with instruction leaflets in English, French, or Portuguese is now also available from INRB. Specifications of the kit are given in Box 2. 
 
 
Box 2. Three Advantages and Three Disadvantages for the New MSC Model 
Advantages 
 
 
Analytical sensitivity <2 trypanosomes per ml of CSF at only â‚¬0.5 per test. 
 
 
Short test time (<15 minutes). 
 
 
Few manipulations.

Prevalence and risk factors for Plasmodium falciparum malaria in pregnant women attending antenatal clinic in Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina Faso),"BackgroundMalaria during pregnancy remains a serious public health problem. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and possible risk factors for malaria in pregnant women attending antenatal clinic at two primary health facilities in Bobo-Dioulasso.MethodsWe conducted a cross sectional study from September to December 2010 in two primary health facilities located in the periurban area of Bobo-Dioulasso. Pregnant women attending antenatal clinic (ANC) were included in the study after signing informed consent. For each participant, the social-demographic profile, malaria and obstetric histories were investigated through a questionnaire. Peripheral blood was collected and thick and thin blood smears were prepared to check Plasmodium falciparum parasitaemia. Hemoglobin concentration was measured. The associations between age, parity, gestational age, schooling, number of ANC visits, use of IPTp-SP, use of insecticide-treated nets (ITN) and anemia with the occurrence of P. falciparum malaria infection during pregnancy were analyzed through logistic regression.ResultsDuring the period of study, 105 (18.1%) out of 579 pregnant women were infected by P. falciparum. The hemoglobin concentration mean was 10.5 Â± 1.7/dL and was significantly lower in pregnant women with malaria infection (9.8 g/dL Â±1.6) than in those who had no malaria infection (10.6 g/dL Â±1.7) (P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis indicated that, education (AOR 1.9, 95% CI = [1.2-3.2]), parity [primigravidae (AOR 5.0, 95% CI = [2.5-9.8]) and secundigravidae (AOR 2.1, 95% CI = [1.2-3.8])], and anaemia (AOR 2.1, 95% CI = [1.3-3.5]) were significantly associated with P. falciparum malaria infection. The use of IPTp-SP was not associated with P. falciparum malaria infection.ConclusionsP. falciparum malaria infection is common in pregnant women attending antenatal clinic and anaemia is an important complication. The results show that the use of IPTp-SP does not reduce the risk of malaria incidence during pregnancy.",2014,BMC Infectious Diseases
An Interpretable and Sparse Neural Network Model for Nonlinear Granger Causality Discovery,"While most classical approaches to Granger causality detection repose upon linear time series assumptions, many interactions in neuroscience and economics applications are nonlinear. We develop an approach to nonlinear Granger causality detection using multilayer perceptrons where the input to the network is the past time lags of all series and the output is the future value of a single series. A sufficient condition for Granger non-causality in this setting is that all of the outgoing weights of the input data, the past lags of a series, to the first hidden layer are zero. For estimation, we utilize a group lasso penalty to shrink groups of input weights to zero. We also propose a hierarchical penalty for simultaneous Granger causality and lag estimation. We validate our approach on simulated data from both a sparse linear autoregressive model and the sparse and nonlinear Lorenz-96 model.",2017,arXiv: Machine Learning
Gene Prediction in Heterogeneous Cancer Tissues and Establishment of Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator Model for Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma,"This study is aimed to establish a Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) model based on tumor heterogeneity to predict the best features of LUSC in various cancer subtypes. The RNASeq data of 505 LUSC cancer samples were downloaded from the TCGA database. Subsequent to the identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), the samples were divided into two subtypes based on the consensus clustering method. The subtypes were estimated with the abundance of immune and non-immune stromal cell populations which infiltrated the tissue. LASSO model was established to predict each subtype's best genes. Enrichment pathway analysis was then carried out. Finally, the validity of the LUSC model for identifying features was established by the survival analysis. 240 and 262 samples were clustered in Subtype-1 and Subtype-2 groups respectively. DEG analysis was performed on each subtype. A standard cutoff was applied and in total, 4586 genes were up regulated and 1495 were down regulated in case of subtype-1 and 5016 genes were up regulated and 3224 were down regulated in case of subtype-2. LASSO model was established to predict the best features from each subtype, 49 and 34 most relevant genes were selected in subtype-1 and subtype-2. The abundance of tissue-infiltrates analysis distinguished the subtypes based on the expression pattern of immune infiltrates. Survival analysis showed that this model could effectively predict the best and distinct features in cancer subtypes. This study suggests that unsupervised clustering and LASSO model-based feature selection can be effectively used to predict relevant genes which might play an important role in cancer diagnosis.",2019,International journal of pharma and bio sciences

Physical and chemical characteristics of aerosol particles and cloud-droplet activation during the Second Pallas Cloud Experiment (Second PaCE),"The Second Pallas Cloud Experiment (Second PaCE) was conducted at the PallasSodankylÃ¤ Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) station in northern Finland from 16 September to 6 October 2005. Measured parameters included aerosol number size distribution, aerosol chemical composition, aerosol hygroscopic growth factor, cloud droplet number size distribution and meteorological parameters. Air mass back trajectories were also calculated. The particulate volume and the inorganic fraction (IO) of particulate mass depended strongly on the air-mass history: central European air masses contain much more particulate matter and have higher IO than marine air masses. The hygroscopic growth factor of particles was positively correlated with the IO. Aerosol activation into cloud droplets was studied for accumulation mode particles (d p > 100 nm). The activation of these particles did not show clear dependency on the number concentration of accumulation mode particles or on IO. These two parameters were positively correlated and their effects on the particle activation could not be separated.",2009,
Targeting at the Margin: the â€˜Glass of Milkâ€™ Subsidy Programme in Peru,"This article evaluates the Vaso de Leche (VL) feeding programme in Peru in order to illustrate an evaluation methodology based on targeting criteria for a decentralised transfer programme.

However, when we use a version of a targeting efficiency measure first introduced by Galasso and Ravallion [2003] which we modify to be defined on the values of allocations, the opposite is the case.

Phylogeny based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain TT1T formed a distinct genus-level lineage in the family Rhodospirillaceae of the class Alphaproteobacteria and exhibited the highest sequence similarity with species of the genera Thalassobaculum (89.9-90.0â€‰% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity), Oceanibaculum (89.4-89.9â€‰%) and Nisaea (89.1-89.7â€‰%). Strain TT1T could be distinguished from species of these phylogenetically closest genera based on differences in DNA G+C contents (56.4â€Šmol% vs 60.0-68.0â€Šmol%), fatty acid profiles and some physiological characteristics. On the basis of the polyphasic taxonomic data from this study, strain TT1T is considered to represent a novel species of a new genus in the family Rhodospirillaceae, for which the name Tagaea marina gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of the type species is TT1T (â€‰=â€‰JCM 18659Tâ€‰=â€‰BCRC 80493T).",2016,International journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology

The study was carried out 21 students in 12th grade were cluded. The model of the research has been defined as the activity research and the data have been collected in the way of examining documents and interview.It was determined that the lesson perform with the visual culture studies effects the students in the way that they analyse the work more extensively. It was concluded that the visial cultures studies help studients obtain more regular and detailed information which becomes permanent so that they could do the work analysis more appropriately and they make the lassons more productive.",2010,
