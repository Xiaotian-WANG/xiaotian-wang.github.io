New Viewpoints on the Species of Xinyi and Mulan,"Xinyi'(è¾›å¤·) and 'Mulan'(æœ¨å…°) are Chinese traditional medicine and medicine species. Based the comparison on the antiquity literature, the type of Xinyi tree (Lassonia quinquepeta Buc'hoz) and the current distribution and culture of Xinyi and Mulan, author first infers that Xinyi tree is Yulania biondii (Pamp.) D. L. Fu (Magnolia biondii Pamp.), not Y. liliiflora (Desr.) D. L. Fu. Mulan tree may be Manglietia fordiana Oliv. or Michelia martinii (H. Lev.) Finet Gagnep. ex H. Lev., not Y. liliiflora (Desr.) also. To correct the view of that Xinyi is Mulan and Mulan is Y. liliiflora, as which most botanist and herbalist regarded now, will accelerate the research and development of Magnoliaceae.",2002,Journal of Wuhan Botanical Research

Interior Eigenvalues from Density Matrix Expansions in Quantum Mechanical Molecular Dynamics,"An accelerated polynomial expansion scheme to construct the density matrix in quantum mechanical molecular dynamics simulations is proposed. The scheme is based on recursive density matrix expansions, e.g., [A. M. N. Niklasson, Phys. Rev. B, 66 (2002), 155115], which are accelerated by a scale-and-fold technique [E. H. Rubensson, J. Chem. Theory Comput., 7 (2011), pp. 1233--1236]. The acceleration scheme requires interior eigenvalue estimates, which may be expensive and cumbersome to come by. Here we show how such eigenvalue estimates can be extracted from the recursive expansion by a simple and robust procedure at a negligible computational cost. Our method is illustrated with density functional tight-binding Born--Oppenheimer molecular dynamics simulations, where the computational effort is dominated by the density matrix construction. In our analysis we identify two different phases of the recursive polynomial expansion, the conditioning and purification phases, and we show that the acceleration repres...",2014,SIAM J.

An efficient algorithm for estimating brain covariance networks,"Often derived from partial correlations or many pairwise analyses, covariance networks represent the inter-relationships among regions and can reveal important topological structures in brain measures from healthy and pathological subjects. However both approaches are not consistent network estimators and are sensitive to the value of the tuning parameters. Here, we propose a consistent covariance network estimator by maximising the network likelihood (MNL) which is robust to the tuning parameter. We validate the consistency of our algorithm theoretically and via a simulation study, and contrast these results against two well-known approaches: the graphical LASSO (gLASSO) and Pearson pairwise correlations (PPC) over a range of tuning parameters. The MNL algorithm had a specificity equal to and greater than 0.94 for all sample sizes in the simulation study, and the sensitivity was shown to increase as the sample size increased. The gLASSO and PPC demonstrated a specificity-sensitivity trade-off over a range of values of tuning parameters highlighting the discrepancy in the results for misspecified values. Application of the MNL algorithm to the case study data showed a loss of connections between healthy and impaired groups, and improved ability to identify between lobe connectivity in contrast to gLASSO networks. In this work, we propose the MNL algorithm as an effective approach to find covariance brain networks, which can inform the organisational features in brain-wide analyses, particularly for large sample sizes.",2018,PLoS ONE

Anatomic left atrial circumferential ablation to electrically isolate pulmonary veins using a novel focused ultrasound balloon catheter.,"Ablative therapy to electrically isolate pulmonary veins (PVs) has been shown to be effective in treating patients who suffer from drug-refractory atrial fibrillation (AF). However, even with ablation confined to the PV ostium, such procedures are associated with significant risk for PV stenosis. This, together with recognition of the significance of atrial foci in the immediate vicinity of PV ostia, has fueled enthusiasm for ablating proximally to the ostia at the venous antra. This is the first reported case of using a novel highintensity focused ultrasound balloon catheter (ProRhythm Inc., Setauket, NY, USA) to electrically isolate all four PVs at their antra in a patient with AF. This catheter is specifically designed to create circumferential lesions at the antrum of each vein to electrically isolate tissue distal to it. Unfocused ultrasound waves emitted from the catheter travel freely in the blood pool, converging approximately 2 mm distal to the balloon surface and creating a 4 mm deep lesion due to hyperthermic circumferential tissue injury at the area of ultrasound beam convergence. 1 Figure 1A shows the placement of the balloon catheter at the antrum of the left superior PV. Contrast was injected through the central lumen of the inflated balloon catheter into the PV to ensure optimal catheter orientation related the venous anatomy. The location of circumferential focused ultrasound energy delivery is depicted by the white arrows. The surface of the balloon is indicated by the black arrowhead. In this case, we used a single focused ultrasound balloon catheter that can create 20-mm diameter circumferential lesions to isolate all four PVs. After delivery of ultrasound energy for 5.2 minutes, electrical isolation of all four veins (ostial diameters 11, 13, 11, and 16 mm) was demonstrated by a Lasso catheter Biosense Webster Inc., Diamond Bar, CA without any complications. During energy delivery to the antrum of the left superior PV, transient atrial asystole and complete AV block (Figure 1B) were observed. We hypothesized that this phenomenon was related to ablation of a plexus of parasympathetic ganglia. Similar observations during circumferential PV ablation using radiofrequency energy have been described and related to improved clinical success. 2",2006,Heart rhythm
Nachweis und diagnostische Wertigkeit von AntikÃ¶rpern gegen das interzellulÃ¤re Polysaccharid-AdhÃ¤sin bei Patienten mit Endoprotheseninfektionen durch Staphylococcus aureus und Staphylococcus epidermidis,"Fremdmaterialassoziierte S. epidermidis und S. aureus Infektionen stellen sowohl hinsichtlich der Diagnostik wie auch Therapie und Pravention weiterhin ein 
herausragendes Problem der modernen Medizin dar. Zentraler Aspekt der Pathogenese von S. epidermidis und S. aureus fremdmaterialassoziierten Infektionen ist die Fahigkeit des Erregers, auf der Oberflache implantierter Fremdkorper mehrlagige Biofilme auszubilden. In den letzten Jahrzehnten wurden grose Anstrengungen unternommen, die Entstehung von Biofilmen besser zu verstehen, um daraus neue diagnostische sowie therapeutische Moglichkeiten abzuleiten. Insbesondere im Rahmen der Diagnostik von Endoprotheseninfektionen existieren zurzeit nur unbefriedigende Ansatze, welche in keinem Fall eine sichere Diagnose oder einen Ausschluss einer Protheseninfektion ermoglichen. In dieser Arbeit sollte die Nutzbarkeit des interzellularen Polysaccharid-Adhasins (PIA) als diagnostisches Antigen untersucht 
werden. PIA wird eine wichtige Rolle in der Entstehung Biofilm-assoziierter S. epidermidis und S. aureus Infektionen beigemessen. Unter Verwendung eines hier 
etablierten, spezifischen ELISA wurden PIA-spezifische Antikorper in Seren von 59 Patienten mit definitiven S. aureus und S. epidermidis Huft- und Knie- 
Endoprotheseninfektionen wie auch in einem Kollektiv gesunder Blutspender quantifiziert. Es konnte gezeigt werden, dass ein signifikanter Unterschied in der 
Titerhohe zwischen den Seren von infizierten Patienten und Blutspendern (p<0,001, TTest)besteht. Dies weist darauf hin, dass PIA in vivo gebildet wird. Eine fehlende 
bimodale Verteilung der Titerhohen macht allerdings eine konkrete Unterscheidung der Gruppen unmoglich. Hieraus kann die Schlussfolgerung gezogen werden, dass der 
Nachweis von Anti-PIA-Antikorpern zur Diagnose einer Endoprotheseninfektion durch S. epidermidis oder S. aureus ungeeignet ist. Zukunftig mussen PIA-unabhangige, 
funktionell an der Biofilmbildung beteiligte Faktoren hinsichtlich ihrer Potenz als diagnostisches Antigen evaluiert werden.",2009,
Factores predictores de respuesta a los tratamientos de inmunotolerancia en pacientes hemofÃ­licos A con inhibidores,"En el momento actual se considera que la aparicion de inhibidores tras la administracion de concentrados del factor deficitario es la complicacion mas seria y que condiciona en mayor medida el tratamiento y la calidad de vida de los hemofilicos. Este problema es mucho mas frecuente en hemofilia A grave (21-33%). El objetivo terapeutico a largo plazo es la erradicacion del inhibidor mediante los tratamientos de induccion de tolerancia inmunologica (ITI). En este trabajo se presentan los resultados de los ITI llevados a cabo en una unidad de referencia en coagulopatias. Se trata de un estudio retrospectivo y prospectivo de los tratamientos efectuados entre 1980 y 2015. En este periodo se trataron 26 pacientes, 3 de los cuales todavia estan en tratamiento. El analisis estadistico se ha efectuado con los 23 pacientes que terminaron la primera linea de ITI. Se ha realizado el analisis descriptivo y un modelo de regresion logistica con penalizacion L1 (LASSO). La mediana de edad en el momento de iniciar el ITI es de 2 anos (Q1,Q3: 1, 3). El valor de la mediana para los diferentes titulos de inhibidor es: historico maximo, 22 UB/mL (Q1,Q3: 10, 100); pre ITI 4,6 UB/mL (Q1,Q3: 2, 8,75); durante el ITI 23,7 UB (Q1,Q3: 2,83, 210). La mediana de tiempo de tratamiento en los pacientes que responden es de 11,7 meses (Q1,Q3: 9,77, 27,66). En cuanto al tipo de factor: 14/23 pacientes utilizaron concentrados de FVIII de origen plasmatico (pdFVIII), 13 de ellos el factor plasmatico era rico en Factor von Willebrand (FVW); 9 pacientes se trataron con concentrado de origen recombinante. En cuanto a la dosis: en 17/23 pacientes se utilizo una dosis 100 UI/kg/dia. Se considero exito cuando el inhibidor fue negativo y ademas, la recuperacion y la vida media del FVIII infundido fue normal. La tasa de exito con las primeras lineas de ITI es del 57%. Hay dos variables que influyen en el exito: a) un menor titulo maximo de inhibidor durante el ITI y b) la utilizacion de pdFVIII para efectuar el ITI. En el analisis estadistico la utilizacion de pdFVIII con FVW aporta una parte pequena, pero no podemos discriminar el poder de esta variable, por las caracteristicas de nuestra serie. No tienen significacion estadistica influyendo en el exito: el tipo de mutacion, el titulo maximo historico de inhibidor, el titulo de inhibidor pre ITI, la edad al ITI, la demora en empezar el ITI, la dosis de FVIII empleada, la utilizacion de accesos venosos centrales ni la infeccion de estos. La tasa de respuesta es del 85,7% cuando se consideran los tratamientos de rescate junto con los de primera linea, incluyendo los dos pacientes con cambios de inmunorrespuesta. La tasa de recidiva despues de un periodo de seguimiento de 9,12 anos (Q1,Q3: 3,98, 13,40) es del 11%. En hemofilicos con inhibidores en edad pediatrica, es importante insistir en la erradicacion del inhibidor, dada la larga expectativa de vida en este grupo poblacional.",2015,
Lasso based feature selection for malaria risk exposure prediction,"In life sciences, the experts generally use empirical knowledge to recode variables, choose interactions and perform selection by classical approach. The aim of this work is to perform automatic learning algorithm for variables selection which can lead to know if experts can be help in they decision or simply replaced by the machine and improve they knowledge and results. The Lasso method can detect the optimal subset of variables for estimation and prediction under some conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel approach which uses automatically all variables available and all interactions. By a double cross-validation combine with Lasso, we select a best subset of variables and with GLM through a simple cross-validation perform predictions. The algorithm assures the stability and the the consistency of estimators.",2015,arXiv: Machine Learning
Gene regulatory network inference using fused LASSO on multiple data sets,"Devising computational methods to accurately reconstruct gene regulatory networks given gene expression data is key to systems biology applications. Here we propose a method for reconstructing gene regulatory networks by simultaneous consideration of data sets from different perturbation experiments and corresponding controls. The method imposes three biologically meaningful constraints: (1) expression levels of each gene should be explained by the expression levels of a small number of transcription factor coding genes, (2) networks inferred from different data sets should be similar with respect to the type and number of regulatory interactions, and (3) relationships between genes which exhibit similar differential behavior over the considered perturbations should be favored. We demonstrate that these constraints can be transformed in a fused LASSO formulation for the proposed method. The comparative analysis on transcriptomics time-series data from prokaryotic species, Escherichia coli and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, as well as a eukaryotic species, mouse, demonstrated that the proposed method has the advantages of the most recent approaches for regulatory network inference, while obtaining better performance and assigning higher scores to the true regulatory links. The study indicates that the combination of sparse regression techniques with other biologically meaningful constraints is a promising framework for gene regulatory network reconstructions.",2016,Scientific Reports
An inner-outer iteration method for solving convex optimization problems involving the sum of three convex functions,"In recent years, the optimization problem of the sum of several convex functions has received much attention. In this paper, we consider solving a class of convex optimization problem which minimizes the sum of three convex functions $f(x)+g(x)+h(Bx)$, where $f(x)$ is differentiable with a Lipschitz continuous gradient, $g(x)$ and $h(x)$ have a closed-form expression of their proximity operators and $B$ is a bounded linear operator. Such optimization problems have wide application in signal recovery and image processing. To make full use of the differentiable function in the problem, we propose several inner-outer iterative algorithms based on the forward-backward splitting algorithm and the three-operator splitting algorithm frameworks. In the process of deriving the iterative algorithms, we use dual and primal-dual methods to solve the proximity operator of the functions $~g~+~h~\circ~B~$ and $~h~\circ~B~$. Under mild assumptions on the parameters, we prove the convergence of the proposed iterative algorithms. By comparing with the Condat and Vu algorithm, the primal-dual fixed point (PDFP) algorithm and the primal-dual three-operator (PD3O) algorithm, we establish the connection between these algorithms with ours. Numerical experiments applied to the fused Lasso problem, the constrained total variation regularization problem and the low-rank total variation image super-resolution problem demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed iterative algorithms.",2019,
PubertÃ¤tsstadium bei Konsumbeginn als Risikofaktor fÃ¼r spÃ¤teren problematischen Alkoholkonsum: Elterliches Erziehungsverhalten als Schutzfaktor?,"Zusammenfassung. Ziel: Der fruhzeitige Konsumbeginn gilt als gesicherter Risikofaktor fur alkoholassoziierte Probleme im Erwachsenenalter. Die vorliegende Arbeit untersucht eine mogliche protektive Wirkung des elterlichen Erziehungsverhaltens auf diesen Zusammenhang. Methodik: Im Rahmen der Mannheimer Risikokinderstudie wurde bei 287Â Jugendlichen (130Â Jungen, 157Â Madchen) das Pubertatsstadium bei Alkoholerstkonsum (PUBA) bestimmt. Mit 19, 22, 23 und 25Â Jahren wurden Parameter des aktuellen Trinkverhaltens erfasst. Elterliches Erziehungsverhalten (Supervision, Akzeptanz, Autonomiegewahrung) wurde im Alter von 15 Jahren erhoben. Ergebnisse: Jugendliche, die wahrend der Pubertat zum ersten Mal Alkohol tranken, konsumierten als junge Erwachsene deutlich mehr Alkohol und wiesen mehr alkoholassoziierte Probleme auf als Jugendliche, deren Erstkonsum in die Zeit der Postpubertat fiel. Dieser Zusammenhang wurde bei pubertaren Erstkonsumenten durch eine Autonomie gewahrende Erziehung abgepuffert. Schlussfolgerungen...",2015,Suchttherapie
Integrating multiple omics data for the discovery of potential Beclin-1 interactions in breast cancer.,"Breast cancer has been reported as one of the most frequently diagnosed malignant diseases and the leading cause of cancer death in women all around the world. Furthermore, this complicated cancer is divided into multiple subtypes which present different clinical symptoms and need correspondingly directed therapy. We took BECN1, a core gene in autophagy performing a tumor inhibitory effect, as a starting point. The study in this paper aims to identify genes related to breast cancer and its multiple subtypes by integrating multiple omics data using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), which is a statistical method that can integrate more than two types of omics data. All the data is obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) platform which stores clinical and molecular tumor data. The model constructed is based on three kinds of data including mRNA-gene expression with a dependent variable level, DNA methylation and copy number alterations as independent variables. Finally, we propose four subnets of four subtypes of breast cancer, and consider as a result of microarray analysis that AFF3 is associated with BECN1 in breast cancer, and may be a potential therapeutic target. This finding may provide some potential targeted therapeutics for the four different subtypes of breast cancer at the genetic level. In conclusion, finding out the major role Beclin-1 plays in breast cancer subtypes is of great value. The results obtained are instructive for further research and may provide excellent results in clinical applications, as well as testing in animal experiments, and may also indicate a new method to perform bioinformatics analysis.",2017,Molecular bioSystems

Swapping Variables for High-Dimensional Sparse Regression from Correlated Measurements,"We consider the high-dimensional sparse linear regression problem of accurately estimating a sparse vector using a small number of linear measurements that are contaminated by noise. It is well known that the standard cadre of computationally tractable sparse regression algorithms---such as the Lasso, Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP), and their extensions---perform poorly when the measurement matrix contains highly correlated columns. To address this shortcoming, we develop a simple greedy algorithm, called SWAP, that iteratively swaps variables until convergence. SWAP is surprisingly effective in handling measurement matrices with high correlations. In fact, we prove that SWAP outputs the true support, the locations of the non-zero entries in the sparse vector, under a relatively mild condition on the measurement matrix. Furthermore, we show that SWAP can be used to boost the performance of any sparse regression algorithm. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of SWAP by comparing it with several state-of-the-art sparse regression algorithms.",2013,ArXiv

Tomografia computerizzata e risonanza magnetica nella patologia del distretto testa collo,"Scopo del lavoro Ã¨ quello di delineare le indicazioni generali alla radioterapia, definitiva o in associazione alla chirurgia, nei pazienti affetti da carcinoma del distretto testa-collo, anche sulla base delle informazioni TC ed RM, e di descrivere le alterazioni morfologiche radiologiche che emergono, differenziando quelle suggestive di persistenza o recidiva neoplastica, da quelle indotte dalla radioterapia. Sono stati selezionati 95 pazienti che hanno praticato radioterapia come unico trattamento o in associazione alla chirurgia. Il primo controllo radiologico Ã¨ stato effettuato di norma in un periodo di tempo compreso tra i 3 e i 4, 5 mesi dal termine della radioterapia. I pazienti sono stati seguiti nel tempo con esami seriati rispettivamente a 6, 9 e 12 mesi a distanza dal termine della radioterapia, a seconda dei rilievi emersi al primo controllo a ciclo terapeutico ultimato. Per quanto concerne la valutazione della risposta del tumore primitivo alla radioterapia sono stati distinti tre gruppi di pazienti. Il primo gruppo comprende soggetti nei quali il tumore primitivo, valutato alla TC e/o RM prima del trattamento radioterapico, ha dimostrato una regressione volumetrica superiore al 75% nei controlli tra i 3 ed i 12 mesi dalla fine del ciclo terapeutico (31 pazienti). Il secondo gruppo comprende soggetti nei quali il volume tissutale residuo dopo radioterapia, nei controlli a tre mesi, ha dimostrato una regressione inferiore al 50%, una persistenza o addirittura una progressione (44 pazienti). Un terzo gruppo Ã¨ costituito da soggetti nei quali la regressione volumetrica del tessuto neoplastico nel controllo a tre mesi dal termine del ciclo terapeutico radioterapico Ã¨ compresa tra il 50 ed il 75%. Quest'ultimo gruppo Ã¨ quello che pone i maggiori problemi diagnostici e che viene seguito con controlli seriati ogni tre mesi, anche in presenza di negativitÃ  degli esami clinici ed endoscopici (20 pazienti). Le alterazioni tissutali post-radioterapiche sono state distinte in transitorie e permanenti. Quelle transitorie hanno raggiunto il massimo della loro espressivitÃ  al termine del ciclo di trattamento, con visualizzazione di una massa conglomerata piÃ¹ estesa del tumore primitivo. Quelle permanenti si sono verificate a carico dei tessuti superficiali (ispessimenti della cute e del platisma, addensamenti nel tessuto adiposo sottocutaneo), nei piani fasciali profondi periviscerali (fibrosi del connettivo lasso adiposo parafaringeo, cervicale anteriore e posteriore, pericarotideo), nelle logge salivari (scialoadenite reattiva e degenerazione grassa), a livello degli spazi mucosi profondi (ispessimento simmetrico e infiltrazione delle pliche ariepiglottiche e delle corde vocali false, obliterazione dei piani adiposi pre- e paraglottici). La difficoltÃ  di interpretazione delle immagini, con particolare riguardo ai possibili falsi positivi e falsi negativi, rappresenta soltanto una delle diverse facce della complessa problematica in corso di carcinoma del distretto testa-collo. Infatti i quesiti da risolvere coinvolgono anche il clinico, il chirurgo, il radioterapista oltre che il radiologo, il cui sforzo comune deve essere quello di garantire al paziente la migliore terapia possibile a fronte di una qualitÃ  di vita accettabile.",1996,The Neuroradiology Journal
"Statistical inference for structural models in high dimension. Sparse generalized linear models, PLS through orthogonal polynomials and community detection in graphs","This thesis falls within the context of high-dimensional data analysis. Nowadays we have access to an increasing amount of information. The major challenge relies on our ability to explore a huge amount of data and to infer their dependency structures.The purpose of this thesis is to study and provide theoretical guarantees to some specific methods that aim at estimating dependency structures for high-dimensional data. The first part of the thesis is devoted to the study of sparse models through Lasso-type methods. In Chapter 1, we present the main results on this topic and then we generalize the Gaussian case to any distribution from the exponential family. The major contribution to this field is presented in Chapter 2 and consists in oracle inequalities for a Group Lasso procedure applied to generalized linear models. These results show that this estimator achieves good performances under some specific conditions on the model. We illustrate this part by considering the case of the Poisson model. The second part concerns linear regression in high dimension but the sparsity assumptions is replaced by a low dimensional structure underlying the data. We focus in particular on the PLS method that attempts to find an optimal decomposition of the predictors given a response. We recall the main idea in Chapter 3. The major contribution to this part consists in a new explicit analytical expression of the dependency structure that links the predictors to the response. The next two chapters illustrate the power of this formula by emphasising new theoretical results for PLS. The third and last part is dedicated to graphs modelling and especially to community detection. After presenting the main trends on this topic, we draw our attention to Spectral Clustering that allows to cluster nodes of a graph with respect to a similarity matrix. In this thesis, we suggest an alternative to this method by considering a $l_1$ penalty. We illustrate this method through simulations.",2015,
"Can There Be a Theology of Disenchantment? Speculative Realism, Correlationism, and Unbinding the nihil in Tillich","Contemporary philosophy seems to be showing signs of dissatisfaction with an agnostic orthodoxy that has been, according to some, all too comfortable for religion. Beginning with what Quentin Meillassoux ironically calls the â€œPtolemaicâ€ counterrevolution of Immanuel Kant, and continuing in both continental and Anglo-American contexts in the forms of phenomenology, linguistic analysis, and pragmatism, philosophy in the modern period has in one way or another disavowed knowledge of the â€œthing-in-itself.â€1 New realists, such as Meillassoux, charge that in so doing it has carved out a philosophical niche to shelter some of its most prized notions (God, freedom, and immortality, to recall Kantâ€™s own program) from the withering impact of the properly revolutionary turn in cosmological thinking inaugurated by Copernicus. Meillassoux labels this long-standing philosophical tradition â€œcorrelationism,â€ because it maintains that access to objects as they are in themselves is barredâ€”we have access to objects only as correlates of particular perspectives held by knowing subjects.",2015,

Regularized Optimization in Statistical Learning: a Bayesian Perspective,"Regularization plays a major role in modern data analysis, whenever non-regularized tting is likely to lead to over-tted model. It is known that most regularized optimization problems have Bayesian interpretation in which the prior plays the role of the regularizer. In this paper, we consider the issue of sensitivity of the regularized solution to the prior specication within the Bayesian perspective. We suggest a class of at-tailed priors for a general likelihood function for robust Bayesian solutions, in the same spirit as the t-distribution being suggested as a at-tail prior for normal likelihood. Results are applied to a family of regularized learning methods and group LASSO. In addition, the consistency issue for LASSO is discussed within this framework.",2006,

Structural Basis for Natural Product Selection and Export by Bacterial ABC Transporters.,"Bacteria under stress produce ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) to target closely related species, such as the lasso peptide microcin J25 (MccJ25). These peptides are also toxic to the producing organisms that utilize dedicated ABC transporters to achieve self-immunity. MccJ25 is exported by the Escherichia coli ABC transporter McjD through a complex mechanism of recognition that has remained elusive. Here, we used biomolecular NMR to study this interaction and identified a region of the toxic peptide that is crucial to its recognition by the ABC transporter. Our study provides evidence that McjD is highly specific to MccJ25 and not to other RiPPs or antibiotics, unlike multidrug ABC transporters. Additionally, we show that MccJ25 is not exported by another natural product ABC transporter. Therefore, we propose that specific interactions between natural product ABC transporters and their substrate provides them with their high degree of specificity. Taken together, these findings suggest that ABC transporters might have acquired structural elements in their binding cavity to recognize and allow promiscuous export of a larger variety of compounds.",2018,ACS chemical biology
Adaptive lasso penalised censored composite quantile regression,"To account for censoring in estimating the accelerated failure time AFT model with right censored data, the weighted least squares regression WLSR has been developed by using the inverse-censoring-probability weights.

For robust estimation in the AFT model, we propose the weighted composite quantile regression WCQR method, in which the sum of weighted multiple quantile objective functions based on the inverse-censoring-probability weights is used as a loss function. As a novel regularisation method for right censored data, we further propose the adaptive lasso penalised WCQR AWCQR method in order to perform simultaneous estimation and variable selection. The large sample properties of the WCQR and AWCQR estimators are established under some regularity conditions. The proposed methods are evaluated through simulation studies and real data applications.",2016,IJDMB
Knowledge driven decomposition of tumor expression profiles,"BackgroundTumors have been hypothesized to be the result of a mixture of oncogenic events, some of which will be reflected in the gene expression of the tumor. Based on this hypothesis a variety of data-driven methods have been employed to decompose tumor expression profiles into component profiles, hypothetically linked to these events. Interpretation of the resulting data-driven components is often done by post-hoc comparison to, for instance, functional groupings of genes into gene sets. None of the data-driven methods allow the incorporation of that type of knowledge directly into the decomposition.ResultsWe present a linear model which uses knowledge driven, pre-defined components to perform the decomposition. We solve this decomposition model in a constrained linear least squares fashion. From a variety of options, a lasso-based solution to the model performs best in linking single gene perturbation data to mouse data. Moreover, we show the decomposition of expression profiles from human breast cancer samples into single gene perturbation profiles and gene sets that are linked to the hallmarks of cancer. For these breast cancer samples we were able to discern several links between clinical parameters, and the decomposition weights, providing new insights into the biology of these tumors. Lastly, we show that the order in which the Lasso regularization shrinks the weights, unveils consensus patterns within clinical subgroups of the breast cancer samples.ConclusionThe proposed lasso-based constrained least squares decomposition provides a stable and relevant relation between samples and knowledge-based components, and is thus a viable alternative to data-driven methods. In addition, the consensus order of component importance within clinical subgroups provides a better molecular characterization of the subtypes.",2009,BMC Bioinformatics
Development of a long non-coding RNA signature for prediction of response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma,"Standard treatment for locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma (LARC) includes a combination of chemotherapy with pyrimidine analogues, such as capecitabine, and radiation therapy, followed by surgery. Currently no clinically useful genomic predictors of benefit from neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) exist for LARC. In this study we assessed the expression of 8,127 long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), poorly studied in LARC, to infer their ability in classifying patients' pathological complete response (pCR). We collected and analyzed, using lncRNA-specific Agilent microarrays a consecutive series of 61 LARC cases undergoing nCRT. Potential lncRNA predictors in responders and non-responders to nCRT were identified with LASSO regression, and a model was optimized using k-fold cross-validation after selection of the three most informative lncRNA. 11 lncRNAs were differentially expressed with false discovery rate < 0.01 between responders and non-responders to NACT. We identified lnc-KLF7-1, lnc-MAB21L2-1, and LINC00324 as the most promising variable subset for classification building. Overall sensitivity and specificity were 0.91 and 0.94 respectively, with an AUC of our ROC curve = 0.93. Our study shows for the first time that lncRNAs can accurately predict response in LARC undergoing nCRT. Our three-lncRNA based signature must be independently validated and further analyses must be conducted to fully understand the biological role of the identified signature, but our results suggest lncRNAs may be an ideal biomarker for response prediction in the studied setting.",2020,PLoS ONE
Isolated pulmonary vein tachycardia during atrial fibrillation,"A 67-year-old man with a 5-year history of drug-refractory persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) lasting for 7 months prior to the procedure underwent radiofrequency (RF) catheter ablation. The initial AF cycle length (CL) in the coronary sinus (CS) was 162 ms. Ablation was started with isolation of the left pulmonary veins (PV) by creating a continuous linear lesion around the ipsilateral PVs in a distance of *1 cm proximally to the PV ostia. Electrical isolation was confirmed by a single circumferential mapping catheter (Lasso, Biosense-Webster, Diamond Bar, CA, USA) which was sequentially placed in the superior and inferior left PV. After electrical disconnection of the left PVs, accompanied by a slow dissociated rhythm in both PVs, isolation of the right PVs was attempted using the same technique. Initially, a long continuous circular lesion was deployed surrounding both right PVs. Afterwards, potential electrical sleeve conductions of both right PVs were specifically targeted by repeatedly replacing the Lasso catheter in the superior and inferior right vein. However, complete elimination of all PV potentials could only be achieved in the right inferior PV. In contrast, the right superior PV (RSPV) still demonstrated PV potentials with a CL shorter than CSâ€“CL. Although a total of 18 min of RF has been applied in order to isolate the right PVs, apparently no elimination of PV potentials in the RSPV could be achieved. Since the very short CL of the RSPV (CL = 114 ms, Fig. 1) was suggestive for a driving role of this vein in the AF process, external electrical cardioversion was performed to clarify the earliest PV activation during sinus rhythm and, thereby, to facilitate electrical isolation of this potentially â€˜â€˜culprit veinâ€™â€™. However, no potentials could be demonstrated in the RSPV after cardioversion (Fig. 2). Furthermore, pacing from within the PV demonstrated RSPV exit block. Thus, this observation retrospectively reveals the presence of a persistent PV tachycardia in the electrically isolated RSPV coexisting with ongoing and independently operating AF in the atria. Since complete isolation was confirmed, AF was reinduced and the ablation procedure was continued using the stepwise ablation approach. This approach comprises PV isolation, bi-atrial defragmentation, defragmentation and/or electrical isolation of the coronary sinus and leftatrial linear ablation. The aim of the mapping and ablation process is to gradually eliminate AF sources as represented by an incremental increase of the overall AFCL resulting in AF termination either directly to sinus rhythm or to atrial tachycardia(s) which are targeted until achievement of sinus rhythm [1, 2].",2010,Clinical Research in Cardiology

Identification of a three-miRNA signature as a novel potential prognostic biomarker in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma.,"Current studies suggest that some microRNAs (miRNAs) are associated with prognosis in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). In this paper, we aimed to identify a miRNAs signature to improve prognostic prediction for ccRCC patients. Using ccRCC RNA-Seq data of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, we identified 177 differentially expressed miRNAs between ccRCC and paracancerous tissue. Then all the ccRCC tumor samples were divided into training set and validation set randomly. Three-miRNA signature including miR130b, miR-18a, and miR-223 were constructed by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression model in training set. According to optimal cut-off value of three-miRNA signature risk score, all the patients could be classified into high-risk group and low-risk group significantly. Survival of patients was significantly different between two groups (hazard ratio, 5.58, 95% confidence interval, 3.17-9.80; Pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001), and three-miRNA signature performed favorably prognostic and predictive accuracy. The results were further validated in the validation set and total set. Multivariate Cox regression analyses and subgroup analyses showed that three-miRNA signature was an independent prognostic factor. Two nomograms that integrated three-miRNA signature and three clinicopathological risk factors were constructed to predict overall survival and disease-free survival after surgery for ccRCC patients. Functional enrichment analysis showed the possible roles of three-miRNA signature in some cancer-associated biological processes and pathways. In conclusion, we developed a novel three-miRNA signature that performed reliable prognostic for patient survival with ccRCC, it might facilitate ccRCC patients counseling and individualize management.",2019,Journal of cellular biochemistry
"Working Paper Series Measuring Bipolarization , Inequality , Welfare and Poverty","This paper analyzes the relationship between bipolarization and inequality, welfare and poverty measures. First, we clarify the similarities and differences between bipolarization and inequality measures. Second, it is shown that bipolarization is the difference between the welfare levels of the richer and poorer income groups when feelings of identification between individuals are based on their utility functions. In fact, bipolarization is interpreted as the welfare of the richer group that is wasted to compensate for income bipolarization. Third, a relationship between bipolarization measurement and the normalized poverty deficit index is established. These findings are applied to the polarization measures of Wolfson (1994), Esteban and Ray (1994) and Lasso de la Vega and Urrutia (2006).",2006,
Assessing (and Not Assessing) the Italian Contribution to Historiography and Political Thought,"Edited by Giuseppe Galasso, one of Italy's most distinguished historians, this large volume seeks to convey the Italian contribution to historiography and political thought from the dawn of the Middle Ages into the present century, though it is overwhelmingly concentrated on the centuries since 1400. It includes six overview essays, but over 70 percent of its bulk consists of short articles, 108 in all, the vast majority on individual figures, and most of them five to seven pages in length. Whereas the approach, through individual figures, makes the volume especially valuable as a reference work, the approach also entails limitations making it hard to delineate and assess a distinctively Italian contribution. Readers must often connect the dots on their own if they are to discern the strands of a distinctive tradition. In his introductory overview, Galasso suggests a special Italian sensitivity to history, or capacity for the philosophy of history, but the suggestion is left vague and is followed up only in the most ad hoc way in the subsequent essays. The book offers little on how Italian idiosyncrasy might have either compromised or enhanced wider impact. Although the extent of Italian international interaction is well documented, there is little attention to reciprocity and the scope for synergy. Nor is there much assessment of the implications of changes in the valences of that interaction over the centuries, especially in breeding self-criticism and sometimes compensatory myth-making that might have further complicated the resonance of Italian offerings. But the volume demonstrates the richness of the Italian contribution and implicitly invites us to better encompass it, perhaps through comparative work and further research on multinational interplay.",2015,History and Theory

Los factores ambientales y su influencia en los patrones de actividad fÃ­sica en adolescentes. (The environmental factors and their influence in the patterns of physical activity in adolescents).,"La mayoria de estudios demuestran; a) un descenso de la actividad fisica (AF) que coincide con la adolescencia, sobre todo en poblacion femenina, b) durante la primavera y la jornada escolar se realiza mayor AF que durante el invierno o el fin de semana, siendo esta actividad fundamentalmente moderada. El objetivo de este estudio es comparar los niveles de actividad fisica de los adolescentes de dos poblaciones aragonesas (Zaragoza y Sabinanigo). Para ello hemos utilizado el Four by one-day Physical Activity Questionnaire. Los resultados de nuestro estudio senalan que: el gasto energetico total derivado de la practica de actividad fisica, es mayor en la zona rural estudiada; mientras que el gasto energetico derivado de la jornada escolar tanto de invierno como de primavera es mayor en la poblacion urbana estudiada, el gasto energetico derivado del fin de semana tanto de invierno como de primavera es mayor en la poblacion rural; es mayor la actividad fisica realizada por los hombres que por las mujeres solo en el caso de la poblacion urbana estudiada; predominan las actividades ligeras o muy ligeras en ambos sexos y poblaciones; encontramos una relacion significativa entre las horas que ven television y la practica de actividad fisica. Palabras clave / keywords : niveles de actividad fisica | gasto energetico | promocion de la actividad fisica | teenagers | levels of physical activity | energy expenditure | physical activity promotion Abstract Most of studies they demonstrate; a) a reduction of the physical activity (AF) that agrees with the adolescence, mainly in feminine population, b) during the spring and the scholastic day is made greater high frequency than during the winter or the weekend, being this fundamentally moderate activity. The objective of this study is to compare the levels of physical activity of the adolescents of two Aragonese populations (Zaragoza and Sabinanigo). For it we have used the Four by one-day Physical Activity Questionnaire. The results of our study indicate that: the energy expenditure total (kcal/kg/day) derivative of the practice of physical activity, is greater in the studied countryside; whereas the energy expenditure derived from the scholastic day as much of winter as of spring is greater in the studied urban population, the energy expenditure derived from the weekend as much of winter as of spring he is greater in the rural population; the physical activity made by the men is greater who by the women single in the case of the studied urban population; the slight or very slight activities in both sexes and populations predominate; we found a significant relation between the hours that watch televisionÂ and the high frequency practice. doi:10.5232/ricyde2006.00401 --------------------------------------------------------------------- Referencias/references Ainsworth, B.A., Haskell, WL., Leon, A.S.

Prognostic Value of a Stemness Index-Associated Signature in Primary Lower-Grade Glioma,"Objective As a prevalent and infiltrative cancer type of the central nervous system, the prognosis of lower-grade glioma (LGG) in adults is highly heterogeneous. Recent evidence has demonstrated the prognostic value of the mRNA expression-based stemness index (mRNAsi) in LGG. Our aim was to develop a stemness index-based signature (SI-signature) for risk stratification and survival prediction. Methods Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between LGG in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and normal brain tissue samples from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project were screened out, and the weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) was employed to identify the mRNAsi-related gene sets. Meanwhile, the Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analyses were performed for the functional annotation of the key genes. ESTIMATE was used to calculate tumor purity for acquiring the correct mRNAsi. Differences in overall survival (OS) between the high and low mRNAsi (corrected mRNAsi) groups were compared using the Kaplan Meier analysis. By combining the Lasso regression with univariate and multivariate Cox regression, the SI-signature was constructed and validated using the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA). Results There was a significant difference in OS between the high and low mRNAsi groups, which was also observed in the two corrected mRNAsi groups. Based on threshold limits, 86 DEGs were most significantly associated with mRNAsi via WGCNA. Seven genes (ADAP2, ALOX5AP, APOBEC3C, FCGRT, GNG5, LRRC25, and SP100) were selected to establish a risk signature for primary LGG. The ROC curves showed a fair performance in survival prediction in both the TCGA and the CGGA validation cohorts. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression revealed that the risk group was an independent prognostic factor in primary LGG. The nomogram was developed based on clinical parameters integrated with the risk signature, and its accuracy for predicting 3- and 5-years survival was assessed by the concordance index, the area under the curve of the time-dependent receiver operating characteristics curve, and calibration curves. Conclusion The SI-signature with seven genes could serve as an independent predictor, and suggests the importance of stemness features in risk stratification and survival prediction in primary LGG.",2020,
Patterns of fish and sea urchin grazing on tropical Indo-Pacific seagrass beds,"Thalassodendron ciliatum shoots were collected from natural populations of fished and unfished protected seagrass meadows to assess the herbivory of fish and sea urchins. Fish herbivory was restricted to unfished seagrass meadows, while sea urchin herbivory took place in fished as well as unfished areas where fish appeared not to be effective urchin predators. The results of this study confirm that grazing by sea urchins is important in tropical seagrass ecosystems and indicate that herbivorous fish graze, and probably consume, substantial amounts of seagrass production in fishing-protected habitats. The fact that much of the information on seagrass herbivory comes from heavily-fished meadows indicates that large-scale studies, which include unfished areas, are necessary to provide reliable spatial patterns of seagrass grazing distribution.",2004,Ecography
Twenty-four month efficacy of a maternal short-course zidovudine regimen to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1 in West Africa.,"OBJECTIVE
To assess the 24 month efficacy of a maternal short-course zidovudine regimen to prevent mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV-1 in a breastfeeding population in West Africa.


METHODS
Data were pooled from two clinical trials: DITRAME-ANRS049a conducted in Abidjan, CÃ´te d'Ivoire and Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina-Faso and RETRO-CI, conducted in Abidjan. Between September 1995 and February 1998, consenting HIV-1-seropositive women were randomly assigned to receive zidovudine (300 mg) or placebo: one tablet twice daily from 36-38 weeks' gestation until delivery, then in DITRAME only, for 7 more days. Paediatric HIV-1 infection was defined as a positive HIV-1 polymerase chain reaction, or if aged > or =15 months, a positive HIV-1 serology. Cumulative risks (CR) of infection were estimated using a competing risk approach with weaning as a competing event.


RESULTS
Among 662 live-born children, 641 had at least one HIV-1 test. All but 12 children were breastfed. At 24 months, overall CR of MTCT were 0.225 in the zidovudine and 0.302 in the placebo group, a 26% significant reduction. Among children born to women with CD4 cell counts < 500/ml at enrollment, CR of MTCT were similar, 0.396 in the zidovudine and 0.413 in the placebo group. Among children born to women with CD4 cell counts > or =500/ml, CR of MTCT were 0.091 in the zidovudine and 0.220 in the placebo group, a significant 59% reduction.


CONCLUSION
A maternal short-course zidovudine regimen reduces MTCT of HIV-1 at age 24 months, despite prolonged breastfeeding. However, efficacy was observed only among women with CD4 cell counts > or =500/ml. New interventions should be considered to prevent MTCT, especially for African women with advanced HIV-1 immunodeficiency.",2002,AIDS
"The Ecology, Biometry and Biomass of the Seagrass Halophila stipulacea Along the Jordanian Coast of the Gulf of Aqaba","Aspects of the ecology, biometry and biomass of the seagrass Halophila stipulacea along the Jordanian coast of the Gulf of Aqaba have been investigated. The vertical distribution covers a depth range of 1 to at least 50 m. There is a decrease in density and biomass with increasing depth to 45 m and an increase in leaf length with increasing depth. Vertical and habitat patterns of distribution are discussed in terms of ecological factors and inherent characters of H. stipulacea. Two populations based on differences in mean leaf length and width are recognized and these are related to major habitats rather than depth. Introduction Most of the species of marine angiosperms or seagrasses have a distribution restricted to the tropics; other species occur in temperate and warm-temperate to subtropical areas (Dawson 1966). The vertical distribution is, however, generally restricted to shallow water primarily because of the dependence on light for photosynthesis. The seagrass community is one of the most productive of the primary producing marine communities (Bakus 1969). Additionally, seagrass beds serve as breeding and nursery grounds for many commercially important fishes and crustaceans. Seagrass beds are also feeding grounds for many coral reef-associated and other species (Randall 1965); important in the biogeochemical cycle of nutrients (McRoy and Barsdate 1970); and in the formation of and as a reservoir for detritus (Harrison and Mann 1976). Seagrass beds are indicative of a number of environmental conditions including light penetration, fine-grained sediment with high organic content, reduced current velocity and stabilization of the bottom (den Hartog 1971). The primary producing communities in the Jordan Gulf of Aqaba include phytoplankton, macroalgae, components of the coral reef complex (those Cnidaria containing Zooxanthellae) and the seagrasses. In view of the fundamental importance of seagrasses in productivity, a program of investigation has been initiated and includes mapping the horizontal and vertical distribution, using a combination of photographs taken from a helicopter and SCUBA diving, productivity, biomass, biometry and nutrientseagrass interaction. Three species of seagrasses have been identified from the Jordanian coast of the Gulf of Aqaba (Boulos and Lahham 1977). The species include Halophila stipulacea, Halophila ovalis and Halodule uninervis. Lipkin (1975) reported two additional species from Aqaba based on previous collections, including Syringodium isoetifolium and Thalassodendron ciliatum. To date these species have not been found along the Jordanian coast. Mergner and Schuhmacher (1974) determined the zonation of H. stipulacea and H. uninervis within a reef lagoon and to a depth of 25 m at one locality on the coast of Jordan. Methods and Materials Halophila stipulacea was selected for detailed study because of its wide horizontal and vertical distribution along the coast of Jordan. The selection of the six localities for study shown in Figure 1 was based on uniformity of the seagrass beds and to provide maximum habitat variation in the occurrence of//, stipulacea within the capabilities of sampling by using SCUBA. Locality 1, on the north coast, is characterized by a gentle gradient and fine-grained sediment. Corals are, for the most part, absent but there is a high concentration of mobile macrofauna and infauna based on the observation of a large number of trails and mounds. One effect of the presence of the fauna is the continual vertical disturbance of the sediment. Localities 2 and 0006-8055/79/0022O425S02.00 Â© by Walter de Gruyter & Co.

GapRepairer: a server to model a structural gap and validate it using topological analysis,"Motivation
Over 25% of protein structures possess unresolved fragments. On the other hand, approximately 6% of protein chains have non-trivial topology (and form knots, slipknots, lassos and links). As the topology is fundamental for the proper function of proteins, modeling of topologically correct structures is decisive in various fields, including biophysics, biotechnology and molecular biology. However, none of the currently existing tools take into account the topology of the model and those which could be modified to include topology, demand experience in bioinformatics, protein topology and knot theory.

In this work, we present the GapRepairer-the server that fills the gap in the spectrum of structure modeling methods. Its easy and intuitive interface offers the power of Modeller homology modeling to many non-experts in the field. This server determines the topology of templates and predicted structures. Such information when possible is used by the server to suggest the best model, or it can be used by the user to score models or to design artificially (dis)entangled structures.

Variable Selection via Regression Trees in the Presence of Irrelevant Variables,"Many tree algorithms have been developed for regression problems. Although they are regarded as good algorithms, most of them suffer from loss of prediction accuracy when there are many irrelevant variables and the number of predictors exceeds the number of observations. We propose the multistep regression tree with adaptive variable selection to handle this problem. The variable selection step and the fitting step comprise the multistep method. The multistep generalized unbiased interaction detection and estimation (GUIDE) with adaptive forward selection (fg) algorithm, as a variable selection tool, performs better than some of the well-known variable selection algorithms such as efficacy adaptive regression tube hunting (EARTH), FSR (false selection rate), LSCV (least squares cross-validation), and LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) for the regression problem. The results based on simulation study show that fg outperforms other algorithms in terms of selection result and computation time. It generally selects the important variables correctly with relatively few irrelevant variables, which gives good prediction accuracy with less computation time.",2013,Communications in Statistics - Simulation and Computation
Newtonized Orthogonal Matching Pursuit: Frequency Estimation Over the Continuum,"We propose a fast sequential algorithm for the fundamental problem of estimating frequencies and amplitudes of a noisy mixture of sinusoids. The algorithm is a natural generalization of Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) to the continuum using Newton refinements, and hence is termed Newtonized OMP (NOMP). Each iteration consists of two phases: detection of a new sinusoid, and sequential Newton refinements of the parameters of already detected sinusoids. The refinements play a critical role in two ways: 1) sidestepping the potential basis mismatch from discretizing a continuous parameter space and 2) providing feedback for locally refining parameters estimated in previous iterations. We characterize convergence and provide a constant false alarm rate (CFAR) based termination criterion. By benchmarking against the CrameÌr-Rao Bound, we show that NOMP achieves near-optimal performance under a variety of conditions. We compare the performance of NOMP with classical algorithms such as MUSIC and more recent Atomic norm Soft Thresholding (AST) and Lasso algorithms, both in terms of frequency estimation accuracy and run time.",2016,IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing

Approximate Leave-One-Out for Fast Parameter Tuning in High Dimensions,"Consider the following class of learning schemes: $$\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}} := \arg\min_{\boldsymbol{\beta}}\;\sum_{j=1}^n \ell(\boldsymbol{x}_j^\top\boldsymbol{\beta}; y_j) + \lambda R(\boldsymbol{\beta}),\qquad\qquad (1) $$ where $\boldsymbol{x}_i \in \mathbb{R}^p$ and $y_i \in \mathbb{R}$ denote the $i^{\text{th}}$ feature and response variable respectively. Let $\ell$ and $R$ be the loss function and regularizer, $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ denote the unknown weights, and $\lambda$ be a regularization parameter. Finding the optimal choice of $\lambda$ is a challenging problem in high-dimensional regimes where both $n$ and $p$ are large. We propose two frameworks to obtain a computationally efficient approximation ALO of the leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) risk for nonsmooth losses and regularizers. Our two frameworks are based on the primal and dual formulations of (1). We prove the equivalence of the two approaches under smoothness conditions. This equivalence enables us to justify the accuracy of both methods under such conditions. We use our approaches to obtain a risk estimate for several standard problems, including generalized LASSO, nuclear norm regularization, and support vector machines. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our results for non-differentiable cases.",2018,ArXiv
Income Diversification and Bank Stability: Evidence from India,"Modern portfolio theory claims that diversification into non-correlated or negatively correlated activities reduces the overall risk of a portfolio. Considering the total income of a bank as a portfolio of interest income and non-interest income, this paper investigates how the variability of interest income and noninterest income, and covariance between interest income and noninterest income influence the various risk factors of banks. We set out a study in the Indian context. We have extracted data for the period 2005-2017 and employed an extended version of Ridge, Lasso and Elastics Net regression to take care of multi-collinearly in our data. We have considered 10-fold cross-validation techniques to get optimal values of tuning parameters for Ridge, Lasso, and Elastics Net regression (which is a convex combination of ridge and the LASSO). We have compared different regression techniques by comparing RMSE and R. We observe that noninterest income is positively correlated with interest income in the Indian context, but it does stabilize variance, idiosyncratic risk & market risk (Beta) of Indian Banks.",2018,
Breast cancer Ki67 expression prediction by DCE-MRI radiomics features.,"AIM
To investigate whether quantitative radiomics features extracted from dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) are associated with Ki67 expression of breast cancer.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
This institutional review board-approved retrospective study comprised 377 Chinese women who were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer in 2015. This cohort included 53 low-Ki67 expression (Ki67 proliferation index less than 14%) and 324 cases with high-Ki67 expression (Ki67 proliferation index more than 14%). A binary-classification of low-versus high- Ki67 expression was performed. A set of 56 quantitative radiomics features, including morphological, greyscale statistic, and texture features, were extracted from the segmented lesion area. Three machine learning classification methods, including naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbour and support vector machine, were employed for the classification and the least absolute shrink age and selection operator (LASSO) method was used to select most predictive features set for the classifiers. Classification performance was evaluated by the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.


RESULES
The model that used naive Bayes classification method achieved the best performance than the other two methods, yielding 0.773 AUC, 0.757 accuracy, 0.777 sensitivity and 0.769 specificity. Three most predictive features, i.e., contrast, entropy and line likeness, were selected by the LASSO method and showed a statistical significance (p<0.05) in the classification.


CONCLUSION
The present study showed that quantitative radiomics imaging features of breast tumour extracted from DCE-MRI are associated with breast cancer Ki67 expression. Future larger studies are needed in order to further evaluate the findings.",2018,Clinical radiology

Linear ablation and circumferential isolation of the pulmonary vein guided by 3D mapping and the double-Lasso technique in patients with atrial fibrillation.,"Objective To perform complete pulmonary vein (PV) isolation with circular lesions around the PVs guided by 3D mapping system and the double-Lasso catheters in patients with atrial fibrillation(AF). Methods 28 patients were referred for radiofrequency catheter ablation. Among them, 12 patients had paroxysmal AF and 16 Patients had persistent AF.After reconstruction of the left atrium by using Carto system,two Lasso catheters were located in the two ipsilateral PVs simultaneously. Then, circumferential ablation was performed at a distance of 0.5~1 cm away from the ostium of PVs.The endpoint was complete conduction block between left atrium and PVs. Results Successful isolation of PVs was achieved in all patients. After isolation, slow automatic activity was observed in 86.6%(97/112) PVs.The procedure time was 205Â±67 min and the X-ray exposure time was 27Â±16 min.No complication occurred during the procedure. During a mean follow-up of 8.5Â±3.7 months, 23 patients were free of AF recurrence with a total procedure success rate of 82.1%. Conclusions The present approach provids clear evidence that PV isolation through circular lesions around the PVs guided by 3D mapping system and double-Lasso catheters is effective and safe for treating AF.",2006,The Chinese Journal of Cardiac Pacing and Electrophysiology
Modeling mill load parameter based on LASSO using multi-scale high dimensional frequency spectra data1,"There are complex mapping relationships among different mill load parameters and multi-scale frequency spectra of ball mill's mechanical vibration and acoustic signals. Aim at to construct an effective and meaningful soft sensor model, how to select interesting input variables of each local-scale frequency spectrum and how to fuse these different multi-scale ones jointly, is still an un-solved open issue. A new method based on LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) and SEN (Selective Ensemble) algorithm for mill load parameter forecasting (MLPF) is proposed in this paper. Candidate submodels are constructed with LASSO based on each local-scale frequency spectrum, and the valued input features are selected at the same time. These ensemble sub-models are selected and combined based on SEN approach by using branch & bound (BB) and adaptive weighting fusion (AWF) algorithms. Regularization coefficients of all candidate sub-models are selected together to ensure diversities among these selected ensemble sub-models. Multi-scale frequency spectra data of mechanical vibration and acoustic signals based on a laboratory scale ball mill are used to validate the proposed method.",2017,2017 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation (ICIA)

Microbial Diversity of Genital Ulcers of HSV-2 Seropositive Women,"We measured the microbial community structure of genital ulcers in women. Swabs from clinically detected ulcers were tested for HSV-2 and Treponema pallidum by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). HSV-2 and T. pallidum were detected by serum antibody testing. Microbial community structure was characterized by high-throughput 16â€‰s rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Multiple group testing and Elastic net and Lasso regressions identified taxa associated with differences in factors of interest. Among 49 ulcer specimens from 49 HSV-2 seropositive women, by PCR HSV-2 was recovered from 28 (57%) specimens and T. pallidum from none; one woman showed serologic evidence of syphilis. Overall, 63% of women were HIV-positive and 49% had an uncircumcised male sex partner. By both multiple group testing and regression, Porphyromonas (FDR p-valueâ€‰=â€‰0.02), Prevotella (FDR p-valueâ€‰=â€‰0.03), Anaerococcus (FDR p-valueâ€‰=â€‰0.07), and Dialister (FDR p-valueâ€‰=â€‰0.09) were detected at higher relative abundance in HSV-2 PCR-positive than negative ulcers. The presence of HSV-2 in a lesion was associated with presumed bacterial agents of Bacterial vaginosis. Differences in bacterial communities may contribute to HSV-2 ulcer pathogenesis, severity, or prolonged healing. If these results are confirmed, future studies may consider the influence of BV treatment on womenâ€™s GUD and HSV-2 incidence and recurrence.",2017,Scientific Reports
Predictive Modeling of Depression with a Large Claim Dataset,"Depression has been a major concern for the employers due to its high prevalence and cost. In United States, 6.8% of the work population had depression and it is accountable for over $100 billion workplace loss every year. Early detection and timely intervention is the key to address this challenge. In this paper, we proposed to leverage a large claim dataset to build depression risk prediction model. This approach is easy to implement and scale because the claim data is accessible for employers at no additional cost. We derived a subset of over 7.2 million patients in a 3-year period, with 2,099 variables including the diagnosis, procedure, medication, and health service provider information. We trained two models (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and random forest *RF)) with first two years data to predict the onset of depression in the third year. Both models achieved the best comparable performance so far according to our knowledge. The important variables identified by our algorithms are mental health related medications and diagnoses (other than depression), gender (female), and other chronic conditions such as back pain. We further validated these variables by confirming in clinical literature. We concluded that the claim data based depression prediction is a viable and low cost approach, especially for self-insured employers.",2019,2019 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)
"Attitude of pregnant women towards HIV testing in Abidjan, CÃ´te d'Ivoire and Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso. DITRAME Study Group (ANRS 049 Clinical Trial). Diminution de la Transmission MÃ¨re Enfant du VIH. Agence Nationale de Recherches sur le SIDA.","OBJECTIVE
To evaluate the attitude of pregnant women towards HIV testing in two cities of West Africa: Abidjan, CÃ´te d'Ivoire and Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso.


METHODS
In the context of a clinical trial to prevent HIV vertical transmission, HIV counselling and testing was offered systematically to women attending antenatal clinics. Informed consent was obtained and test results were given anonymously. Multiple logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with refusal for testing and failure to return for test results.


RESULTS
A total of 9724 pregnant women were interviewed from January 1995 to September 1996. In Abidjan (n=5766) and Bobo-Dioulasso (n=3958), 78 and 92.4% of the women consented to HIV testing, respectively, and 58.4 and 81.8% of them returned for the test results disclosure, respectively. In the two sites, the counsellors themselves and high educational level of the women appeared to be related to refusal of the test, whereas last trimester gestation was associated with failure to return for test results. In Abidjan, foreigners and employees were more likely to refuse testing, and HIV-infected women were three times less likely to return for results than uninfected women.


CONCLUSION
Future implementation of interventions to reduce vertical transmission of HIV that require antenatal HIV testing and counselling will have to solve issue of acceptability of HIV testing by pregnant women.",1998,AIDS

"Modeling Areal Measures of Campsite Impacts on the Appalachian National Scenic Trail, USA Using Airborne LiDAR and Field Collected Data","Recent research has emphasized the need to professionally manage campsites for long-term use, particularly in light of rising visitation to natural protected areas worldwide. Camping regulations vary considerably along the length of any long-distance trail due to the many land types and management agencies involved. Large proportions of long-distance trails have at-large camping policies, resulting in camping problems associated with visitor-chosen or developed campsites. Several long-term monitoring studies in areas with at-large camping policies indicate the expansion and proliferation of individual campsites, and growth of overall camping related impacts, to be a substantial managerial concern. This research evaluates the relative influence of environmental and topographic factors, both collected in the field and modeled in GIS using highresolution topography (LiDAR) data, on areal measures of campsite impact utilizing Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) penalized regression for factor selection and Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) for regressions. Chosen variables in regressions explained 64% of the variation in campsite size and 61% of the variation in the area of vegetation loss on a campsite. Results indicate four variables managers can utilize to enhance the sustainability of campsites: use level, overnight site type, and terrain characteristics relating to slope and topographic roughness. Results support indirect management methods that rely on the design and location of campsites and trails and not the effectiveness of enforcement or restricting visitor freedom. In the face of rising use, techniques and concepts presented aid in identifying or creating ecologically sustainable campsites.

Variable selection in omics data: A practical evaluation of small sample sizes,"In omics experiments, variable selection involves a large number of metabolites/ genes and a small number of samples (the n < p problem). The ultimate goal is often the identification of one, or a few features that are different among conditions- a biomarker. Complicating biomarker identification, the p variables often contain a correlation structure due to the biology of the experiment making identifying causal compounds from correlated compounds difficult. Additionally, there may be elements in the experimental design (blocks, batches) that introduce structure in the data. While this problem has been discussed in the literature and various strategies proposed, the over fitting problems concomitant with such approaches are rarely acknowledged. Instead of viewing a single omics experiment as a definitive test for a biomarker, an unrealistic analytical goal, we propose to view such studies as screening studies where the goal of the study is to reduce the number of features present in the second round of testing, and to limit the Type II error. Using this perspective, the performance of LASSO, ridge regression and Elastic Net was compared with the performance of an ANOVA via a simulation study and two real data comparisons. Interestingly, a dramatic increase in the number of features had no effect on Type I error for the ANOVA approach. ANOVA, even without multiple test correction, has a low false positive rates in the scenarios tested. The Elastic Net has an inflated Type I error (from 10 to 50%) for small numbers of features which increases with sample size. The Type II error rate for the ANOVA is comparable or lower than that for the Elastic Net leading us to conclude that an ANOVA is an effective analytical tool for the initial screening of features in omics experiments.",2018,PLoS ONE
Untersuchungen zur Pharmakokinetik der Methylxanthine Theophyllin und Theobromin hinsichtlich der Dopingrelevanz beim Pferd,"Aim of
 this study was to optimize and validate a suitable method for the analysis
 detection and quantification of theophylline,
 theobromine and the
 metabolites paraxanthine
 and caffeine in blood and urine samples of horses and to investigate the
 pharmacokinetic behaviour of caffeine and theobromine.
 Validation
 and measurement of samples was made by using a high performance liquid
 chromatograph (HPLC) with connected tandem-mass-spectrometer. Validation
 contained the criteria selectivity, linearity, accuracy, precision, stability
 and recovery. The limit of quantification for theophylline, theobromine, paraxanthine and caffeine was fixed at 100 ng/ml in plasma
 and at 50 ng/ml in urine
 for theophylline, paraxanthine and caffeine. For theobromine it was fixed at 100 ng/ml. The limit
 of detection was found at 13 ng/ml
 for theophylline, at 15 ng/ml for theobromine, at
 14 ng/ml for caffeine and at 29 ng/ml for paraxanthine
 in plasma. In urine the limit of detection was found at 20 ng/ml for theophylline, at 26 ng/ml for theobromine,
 at 33 ng/ml for caffeine
 and at 32 ng/ml for paraxanthine.
 Theophylline was administered to six horses at
 a single intravenous dose of 4 mg/kg body weight, theophylline at a single oral dose of 4 mg/kg body
 weight, or theobromine at
 a single intravenous dose of 4 mg/kg body weight. Maximum concentrations of theophylline in plasma after
 intravenous administration ranged between 5165 and 8834 ng/ml. Maximum theophylline concentrations in
 urine ranged between 21636 and 93373 ng/ml.
 60 hours after administration urine concentrations of all six horses were not
 below limit of quantification. In plasma and urine the metabolites paraxanthine and caffeine were
 detectable. But caffeine concentrations were mainly around limit of
 detection. Theobromine
 was not detectable.
 Maximum
 concentrations of theophylline
 in plasma after oral administration ranged between 1791 and 3483 ng/ml. Maximum concentrations
 of theophylline in urine
 ranged between 16365 and 41256 ng/ml.
 108 hours after administration the urine concentration of only one horse was
 below limit of quantification. In plasma and urine the metabolite paraxanthine was detectable. After
 administration of theobromine
 its maximum concentrations in plasma ranged between 5715 and 12402 ng/ml and in urine between
 65771 and 94889 ng/ml.
 168 hours after administration all urine concentrations of the six horses
 were still above limit of detection. No metabolites could be detected in
 plasma and urine. Using the
 pattern of metabolites the parent substance can be concluded. If there is
 detected almost sole theobromine
 in plasma or urine, application of theobromine
 can be submitted, and if there is detected theophylline and paraxanthine in plasma or urine, application of theophylline can be submitted.
 Afterwards
 the results were integrated into a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic approach of TOUTAIN and LASSOURD
 (2002) to calculate the irrelevant plasma and urine concentrations where
 caffeine has no effect on the organism anymore. Calculation
 of effective plasma concentration, irrelevant plasma concentration and
 irrelevant urine concentration by the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model of TOUTAIN and LASSOURD
 (2002) showed that for theophylline
 the irrelevant plasma concentration (at
 14 ng/ml) and urine concentration (at 40 ng/ml) at a dosing interval of
 12 hours are below respectively at limit of detection. Therefore it is
 concluded that any detection of theophylline
 in plasma or urine by this method has to be considered as a positive result
 of dopingtest. That is
 why an establishment of a selected cut-off value for therapeutics seems not
 to be acceptable for theophylline.
 In
 addition a considerable variance of measured data demonstrates the interindividual variability. It
 must be concluded that a prediction about excretion times of theophylline and theobromine based on this data
 by a small number of probands
 is not reliably possible. Any
 detection of theophylline
 in plasma or urine samples should be considered as relevant for doping and
 should be punished appropriately.",2007,
Statistical integrative omics methods for disease subtype discovery,"Disease phenotyping using omics data has become a popular approach that can poten-tially lead to better personalized treatment. Identifying disease subtypes via unsupervised machine learning is the ï¬rst step towards this goal. With the accumulation of massive high-throughput omics data sets, omics data integration becomes essential to improve statistical power and reproducibility. In this dissertation, two directions from sparse K-means method will be extended. 
The ï¬rst extension is a meta-analytic framework to identify novel disease subtypes when expression proï¬les from multiple cohorts are available. The lasso regularization and meta-analysis can identify a unique set of gene features for subtype characterization. By adding pattern matching reward function, consistency of subtype signatures across studies can be achieved. 
The second extension is using integrating multi-level omics datasets by incorporating prior biological knowledge using sparse overlapping group lasso approach. An algorithm using alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM) will be applied for fast optimization. 
For both topics, simulation and real applications in breast cancer and leukemia will show the superior clustering accuracy, feature selection and functional annotation. These methods will improved statistical power, prediction accuracy and reproducibility of disease subtype discovery analysis. 
Contribution to public health: The proposed methods are able to identify disease subtypes from complex multi-level or multi-cohort omics data. Disease subtype deï¬nition is essential to deliver personalized medicine, since treating diï¬€erent subtypes by its most appropriate medicine will achieve the most eï¬€ective treatment eï¬€ect and eliminate side eï¬€ect. Omics data itself can provide better deï¬nition of disease subtypes than regular pathological approaches. By multi-level or multi-cohort omics data, we are able to gain statistical power and reproducibility, and the resulting subtype deï¬nition is much reliable, convincing and reproducible than single study analysis.",2017,
Identification and external validation of a novel miRNA signature for lymph node metastasis prediction in submucosalâ€invasive gastric cancer patients,"Endoscopic resection (ER) has been increasingly performed in the treatment of early gastric cancer (GC). However, lymph node metastasis (LNM) can cause treatment failure with ER, especially in T1b patients. Here, we attempted to develop a miRNA-based classifier to detect LNM in T1b patients. Based on high-throughput data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we identified 20 miRNAs whose expression significantly changed in T1-2 GC with LNM vs T1-2 GC without LNM. We then developed a miRNA signature to predict LNM of T1b GC using the LASSO model and backward step wise elimination approach in a training cohort. Furthermore, the predictive accuracy of this classifier was validated in both an internal testing group of 63 patients and an external independent group of 114 patients. This systematic and comprehensive in silico study identified a 7-miRNA signature with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) value of 0.843 in T1-2 GC and 0.911 in T1 EGC. The backward elimination was further used to develop a 4-miRNA (miR-153-3p, miR-708, miR-940 and miR-375) risk-stratification model in the training cohort with an AUROC value of 0.898 in cohort 2. When pathologic results were used as a reference, the risk model yielded AUROC values of 0.829 and 0.792 in two cohorts of endoscopic biopsy specimens. This novel miRNA-LNM classifier works better than the currently used pathologic criteria of ER in T1b EGC. This classifier could individualize the management of T1b patients and facilitate treatment decisions.",2019,Cancer Medicine

Klinisch scheint die stammzellassoziierte Fettzelltransplantation regenerative Effekte zu erzielen, wenngleich derzeit keinerlei randomisiert-kontrollierte Studien dazu existieren. Die Stammzell-basierte Fettzelltransplantation kann neben Volumeneffekten bei Konturdefekten auch die HautqualitÃ¤t verbessern [4]. Wir zeigen im Folgenden die Anwendung der stammzellangereicherten Fettinjektion, welche mit dem vorgestellten System konform mit dem Gewebegesetz steril im Operationssaal durchgefÃ¼hrt werden kann bei 2Patientinnen mit Strahlenulzera. Zurzeit bestehen keine Hinweise auf ein erhÃ¶htes Risiko einer Tumorinduktion durch eine stammzellangereicherte Fettinjektion [5].",2013,Zentralblatt fur Chirurgie

The main part of the field is composed of clastic molassoids formed during 'early orogen' stage in the coastal part of an extensive paleobasin with a slow water current and in shallow lakes of the Mishikha-Klyuevka and Osinovka river paleobasins that formed, respectively, at the Oligocene-Miocene and Early-Middle Miocene boundaries. In the Miocene, as suggested by analyses of malacofauna and diatoms, South Baikal was a major, quite deep paleolake. These water bodies were related in the Miocene as evidenced by the partial similarity of diatom species found in South Baikal and the Tunka valley, as well as the presence of similar endemic fauna species in the sediments. Accumulated coarse, mainly proluvial-alluvial deposits are indicators of the tectonic activity that resulted in a dramatic â€˜late orogenâ€™ increase of contrasting features of the regional terrain.",2014,
Viral-associated haemophagocytosis and elevated serum TNF-alpha with parvovirus-B19-related pancytopenia in patients with hereditary spherocytosis.,"Aplastic crisis in patients with hereditary spherocytosis is well known to be caused by human parvovirus B19 (Mortimer 1983; Young 1988). Haemopoietic cell infection with human parvovirus is specific, and confined to the erythroid series (Mortimer et al. 1983) and infection of myeloid and magakaryocyte elements has not been seen. However, most parvovirus-infected patients show transient falls in neutrophil and platelet counts (Anderson et al. 1985; Potter et al. 1987; Hanada et al. 1988). Most recently, Muir and his colleagues (1992) proposed that viralassociated haemophagocytosis could account for the pancytopenia that may accompany human parvovirus B19 infection in two patients with hereditary spherocytosis. They suggested that various cytokines, particularly interferon-y (IFN-y), have been implicated in the viral-associated haemophagocytosis, although any cytokine levels of serum were not measured in their report. We report here such two patients in whom serum levels of IFN-y and tumour necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) could be measured during the acute phase of infection, and found that the serum levels of IFN-y were not increased, but those of TNF-a were elevated. Thus, TNF-a might be implicated in the viral-associated haemophagocytosis with the parvovirus-B19-related pancytopenia.",1994,Clinical and laboratory haematology
"Sex-Specific Planktonic Larval Durations in the Bluehead Wrasse, Thalassoma bifasciatum","The bluehead wrasse, Thalassoma bifasciatum (Labridae), a protogynous hermaphrodite common to shallow reefs of the Caribbean, exhibits two color-phases: small, initial phase (IP) individuals may be either male or female, while larger, terminal phase individuals are always male. Among individuals in the initial phase, population sex ratios are generally female biased; however, that bias becomes increasingly pronounced on smaller reefs. We tested the hypothesis that this relationship between population size and IP sex ratio results from sex-specific recruitment strategies. Initial phase males experience very low reproductive success on small reefs, but do well on larger reefs. It would thus be adaptive for IP males to avoid small, patch reefs common in lagoons by preferentially settling on the first reef they encounter: the large, fringing reefs forming the seaward edge of lagoon systems. We used otolith analysis to test the prediction that IP males would exhibit shorter and less variable planktonic larval durations (PLD) relative to IP females. Our data confirm the second of these predictions, IP male PLDs were significantly less variable than those of IP females, but this difference was not strong enough to result in a shift in the mean PLDs of IP males and females.",2013,Copeia
Constrained Spectral Clustering using L1 Regularization,"Constrained spectral clustering is a semi-supervised learning problem that aims at incorporating userdefined constraints in spectral clustering. Typically, there are two kinds of constraints: (i) must-link, and (ii) cannot-link. These constraints represent prior knowledge indicating whether two data objects should be in the same cluster or not; thereby aiding in clustering. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that uses convex subproblems to incorporate constraints in spectral clustering and co-clustering. In comparison to the prior state-of-art approaches, our approach presents a more natural way to incorporate constraints in the spectral methods and allows us to make a trade off between the number of satisfied constraints and the quality of partitions on the original graph. We use an L1 regularizer analogous to LASSO, often used in literature to induce sparsity, in order to control the number of constraints satisfied. Our approach can handle both must-link and cannot-link constraints, unlike a large number of previous approaches that mainly work on the former. Further, our formulation is based on the reduction to a convex subproblem which is relatively easy to solve using existing solvers. We test our proposed approach on real world datasets and show its effectiveness for both spectral clustering and co-clustering over the prior state-of-art.",2013,
Improved Intact Soil-Core Carbon Determination Applying Regression Shrinkage and Variable Selection Techniques to Complete Spectrum Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS),"Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) provides a potential method for rapid, in situ soil C measurement. In previous research on the application of LIBS to intact soil cores, we hypothesized that ultraviolet (UV) spectrum LIBS (200â€“300 nm) might not provide sufficient elemental information to reliably discriminate between soil organic C (SOC) and inorganic C (IC). In this study, using a custom complete spectrum (245â€“925 nm) core-scanning LIBS instrument, we analyzed 60 intact soil cores from six wheat fields. Predictive multi-response partial least squares (PLS2) models using full and reduced spectrum LIBS were compared for directly determining soil total C (TC), IC, and SOC. Two regression shrinkage and variable selection approaches, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and sparse multivariate regression with covariance estimation (MRCE), were tested for soil C predictions and the identification of wavelengths important for soil C prediction. Using complete spectrum LIBS for PLS2 modeling reduced the calibration standard error of prediction (SEP) 15 and 19% for TC and IC, respectively, compared to UV spectrum LIBS. The LASSO and MRCE approaches provided significantly improved calibration accuracy and reduced SEP 32â€“55% over UV spectrum PLS2 models. We conclude that (1) complete spectrum LIBS is superior to UV spectrum LIBS for predicting soil C for intact soil cores without pretreatment; (2) LASSO and MRCE approaches provide improved calibration prediction accuracy over PLS2 but require additional testing with increased soil and target analyte diversity; and (3) measurement errors associated with analyzing intact cores (e.g., sample density and surface roughness) require further study and quantification.",2013,Applied Spectroscopy
Detection and Estimation of Block Structure in Spatial Weight Matrix,"In many economic applications, it is often of interest to categorize, classify, or label individuals by groups based on similarity of observed behavior. We propose a method that captures group affiliation or, equivalently, estimates the block structure of a neighboring matrix embedded in a Spatial Econometric model. The main results of the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Lasso) estimator shows that off-diagonal block elements are estimated as zeros with high probability, property defined as â€œzero-block consistency.â€ Furthermore, we present and prove zero-block consistency for the estimated spatial weight matrix even under a thin margin of interaction between groups. The tool developed in this article can be used as a verification of block structure by applied researchers, or as an exploration tool for estimating unknown block structures. We analyzed the U.S. Senate voting data and correctly identified blocks based on party affiliations. Simulations also show that the method performs well.",2015,Econometric Reviews
"Contrasting the maturation, growth, spatial distribution and vulnerability to environmental warming of Hippoglossoides robustus (Bering flounder) with H. elassodon (flathead sole) in the eastern Bering Sea","Abstract Two similar appearing congeners, Hippoglossoides robustus (Bering flounder) and H. elassodon (flathead sole), inhabit the Bering Sea and are harvested together during the commercial fishery. In order to establish more precise overfishing limits, the annual spawning biomass must be estimated. Spawning biomass is modelled using the best estimate of the age and length at which 50% of the stock is expected to reach maturity (A 50, L 50). The major objective of this study was to establish the first maturity estimates for Bering flounder. Females matured at a similar age for Bering flounder (A 50, 9 years) and flathead sole (A 50, 10 years). However, the body length at which females matured was significantly smaller for Bering flounder (L 50, 238 mm) compared to flathead sole (L 50, 320 mm). The difference in the length-at-maturity was probably caused by growth differences, which significantly differed between species. The distribution and spawning locations of both species in the eastern Bering Sea su...",2011,Marine Biology Research
Guidelines for the Design of Biochemistry Websites,"The internet is a means of communication that cannot be disregarded by contemporaryeducational systems. Public and private incentive policies aimed at the application ofdigital devices in the exchange of knowledge in and outside schools have beenimplemented in the last decades. However, risks posed by academic research on line arewidely acknowledged with regard to the quality of information (Lourenco, 2010). One of themain aspects of this issue is the selection of reliable and potentially educational pagesdeveloped for specific target audiences. This study has the objective of providingguidelines for those who intend to develop sites, wiki pages, and educational PBwikisfocused on Biochemistry, or even adapt existing ones. Considering the fact that there is nospecific legislation for the use of the Internet in Brazil, it is necessary to stimulate selfregulationof the sector in order to establish minimum quality standards, safety, andreliability of sites containing information in the educational area. Thus, it is necessary toestablish some parameters to help guiding research for educational purposes on theinternet. To be a potentially didactic Biochemistry page, one must follow this set oforientation: clearly establish the target audience and, then, define the contents the properway. Once the materials have been organized, establish, whenever possible and pertinent,links with references to professional and/ or research home pages, to ProfessionalAssociations in the Biochemistry field, among others. Link the page to an institutionalresearch program, such as International Virtual Education Network, a program developedby the Brazilian Distance Education Department. Finally, it is necessary to provideinteractive possibilities and dynamic images of the biochemical processes studied in classthat will justify and differentiate the page from the many existing ones.

The lignite electricity-generating sector in Greece: Current status and future prospects,"Lignite plays an important role in Greece's energy sector as it satisfies over 70% of country's needs in electric power. The extraction of lignite takes place mainly in three regions of Greece, namely Ptolemais-Amyndeon, Megalopolis and Florina. The annual production of lignite is around 60 million tons, out of which 48 million tons derive from the coal fields of northern Greece (Ptolemais-Amyndeon and Florina). Almost the entire lignite production is consumed for electricity generation, while small amounts of lignite are used for briquettes and other applications. The Greek coal-fired power plants, which are about 4500 MW, use conventional technology and they are old (an average of 30 years). 
 
In the coming years new coal fields will be exploited in Florinaâ€”another 2.5 million tons of coalâ€”in order to satisfy the currently under construction 365 MW plant located at Meliti, Florina, Northern Greece. Even though the lignite reserves are widespread in Greece and other areas such as Elassona and Drama could possibly host power plants, it is expected that the Florina power plant will be the last coal-fired plant to be build in the country. 
 
Lignite has to compete with natural gasâ€”the construction of the main gas pipeline network has been completedâ€”imported oil and renewable energy sources. The new EU regulations on power plant emissions raise obstacles for the firing of lignite, although it is low in sulphur. It must be shown that lignite produces low cost electricity in a environmentally friendly manner. The utilization of fly ash and land reclamation can improve the situation in lignite mining. In particular, specific attention was paid to further research and potential use of fly ash in road construction, the production of bricks and concrete, and the production of zeolites from lignitic fly ash. The use of clean coal technologies in power plants can solve many emission problems. Specific measures to increase the efficiency of lignite-fired power units might include: identification of the loss sources of every unit, improvement of the cold end of the steam turbines, optimization of the beater wheel mills operation, and the combination of natural gas-fired turbines with the existing boilers. 
 
The liberalization of the electricity market needs to be considered seriously from the lignite industry, since the potential electricity producers can freely choose from all kinds of fuels, such as imported coal, oil, gas and renewables. However, Greek lignite meets the requirements for the security of supply, as indicated in the EU's Green Paper. It needs only to be competitive in the new energy sector by improving mining and combustion conditions. Further research on these topics, through the European Commission's ECSC and Framework Programmes, as well as the national programmes, is required.

Regularization and variable selection for infinite variance autoregressive models,"Abstract Autoregressive models with infinite variance are of great importance in modeling heavy-tailed time series and have been well studied. In this paper, we propose a penalized method to conduct model selection for autoregressive models with innovations having Pareto-like distributions with index Î± âˆˆ ( 0,2 ) . By combining the least absolute deviation loss function and the adaptive lasso penalty, the proposed method is able to consistently identify the true model and at the same time produce efficient estimators with a convergence rate of n âˆ’ 1 / Î± . In addition, our approach provides a unified way to conduct variable selection for autoregressive models with finite or infinite variance. A simulation study and a real data analysis are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of our method.",2012,Journal of Statistical Planning and Inference
La nautike dynamis in Senofonte dallâ€™Athenaion Politeia ai Poroi,"This paper aims at examining the value of the nautike dynamis in Xenophonâ€™s works, from Athenaion Politeia to Poroi. As already demonstrated by previous essays between 2002 and 2005, Ap was written by a young Xenophon after the events of the 411 B.C.: he positively esteems the advantages of the Athenian thalassocracy, emphasizes the relationship between sea-power and democracy and considers a government founded on the oplitai as impossible. The only limit of Athens seems to be its geographical position, as it was not an island. Xenophonâ€™s interest in the Athenian sea-power seems to fade in the years of the Agesilaosâ€™ campaigns and during his stay in Sicily and his exile in Scillus. However, it returns to be significant again after Leuktra in the years of the incoming Theban egemony, when Xenophon came back from his exile. He wrote in this period the â€œthucydideanâ€ part of his Hellenika and the Proklesâ€™s speech (Hell. VII, 1, 1-14), and he introduced in the Poroi the topic of Athens as a â€œpacificâ€ thalassocracy. Lâ€™articolo considera il valore di nautike dynamis in Senofonte, dallâ€™Athenaion politeia ai Poroi. Come gia dimostrato in precedenti saggi tra il 2002 e il 2005, Ap fu scritta dal giovane SenofonteÂ  dopo i fatti del 411 a.C.: lâ€™opera valuta positivamente i vantaggi della talassocrazia ateniese, coglie il rapporto fra democrazia e potenza navale e considera impossibile un governo fondato sugli opliti. Il solo limite di Atene sembra la sua posizione geografica e la sua condizione non â€œisolanaâ€. Lâ€™interesse di Senofonte per la potenza navale ateniese sembra diminuire negli anni delle campagne di Agesilao, del soggiorno in Sicilia e dellâ€™esilio a Scillunte. Esso ritorna pero significativo dopo Leuttra, allâ€™epoca dellâ€™avvento dellâ€™egemonia tebana, quando Senofonte rientro dallâ€™esilio. In questo periodo egli scrisse la parte â€œtucidideaâ€ delle Elleniche e il discorso di Procle di Fliunte (Hell. VII, 1, 1-14) e riprese, nei Poroi, il tema di Atene come potenza talassocratica â€œpacificaâ€.",2011,Historika : Studi di Storia Greca e Romana
"Die folgenden fÃ¼nf Artikel sind BeitrÃ¤ge der AG ArchÃ¤ologie zur Tagung der Gesellschaft fÃ¼r Klassifikation, die vom 9.-11.3. in Dortmund stattfand","Correspondence analysis (CA) is a well-known technique for the seriation of archaeological assemblages. One problem with the CA seriation Solution isthat only a relative ordering of the assemblages is obtained. However, GROENEN & POBLOME (2003) and POBLOME & GROENEN (2003) proposed a constrained CA approach that incorporates additional information, in the form of equality and inequality constraints concerning the time points of the assemblages, in order to improve the usual CA Solution. Using such constraints, explicit dates can be assigned to the seriation Solution. In this paper, we study the quality of the constrained CA Solution more closely using a Simulation study. To be more precise, we study how well ordinary and constrained CA are able to recover the time order and the explicit dates. Moreover, by varying the amount and type (equality, inequality) of constraints, we investigate how much extra information is required to obtain a satisfactory reproduction of the true time frame. The Simulation study is set up in such a way that it mimics the data of a series of ceramic assemblages consisting of the locally produced tableware from Sagalassos (SW Turkey).",2003,

Variable selection for high-dimensional genomic data with censored outcomes using group lasso prior,"The variable selection problem is discussed in the context of high-dimensional failure time data arising from the accelerated failure time model. A data augmentation approach is employed in order to deal with censored survival times and to facilitate prior-posterior conjugacy. To identify a set of grouped relevant covariates, a shrinkage prior distribution is specified for regression coefficients mimicking the effect of group lasso penalty. It is noted that unlike the corresponding frequentist method, a Bayesian penalized regression approach cannot shrink the estimates of coefficients to exact zeros in general. Towards resolving the issue, a two-stage thresholding method that exploits the scaled neighborhood criterion and the Bayesian information criterion is devised. Simulation studies are performed to assess the robustness and performance of the proposed method in terms of variable selection accuracy and predictive power. The method is successfully applied to a set of microarray data on the individuals diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. In addition, an R package called psbcGroup, which can be downloaded freely from CRAN, is developed for the implementation of the methods.",2017,Comput. Stat. Data Anal.
"Variable Selection by Bayesian Adaptive Lasso and Iterative Adaptive Lasso, with Application for Genome-wide Multiple Loci Mapping","Despite many recent methodological developments, variable selection in high dimensional settings where the number of covariates (p) is larger than the sample size (n) remains a difficult problem, especially when the covariates with zero coefficients are correlated with some covariates with nonzero coefficients. One such example is genome-wide multiple loci mapping with dense genetic markers, where the number of covariates (i.e., the number of genetic markers) are often larger than the sample size and nearby markers often share similar genotype profiles due to linkage or linkage disequilibrium. The adaptive Lasso (Zou, H. 2006) is a state-of-the-art method for simultaneous variable selection and estimation in the setting of linear regression. However, it requires consistent initial estimates of the regression coefficients, which are generally not available in the aforementioned high-dimensional settings. In this paper, we propose two variable selection methods: the Bayesian adaptive Lasso and the iterative adaptive Lasso. These two methods extend the adaptive Lasso in the sense that they do not require any informative initial estimates of the regression coefficients. We systematically evaluate the variable selection performance of the proposed methods as well as several existing methods within the framework of genome-wide multiple loci mapping. We show that the proposed methods have improved variable selection performance compared to most existing methods and the iterative adaptive Lasso also has superior computational efficiency.

Urban landscape survey in Italy and the Mediterranean,"Field survey has been making a major contribution to our understanding of the rural landscapes of the Mediterranean for nearly forty years. During that time the techniques used to map ancient settlement patterns have grown in sophistication from being a process of simply identifying sites in the landscape, to one which provided nuanced understandings of their layouts, chronologies and contexts. This has led to a revolution in how archaeologists approach urban sites, with survey techniques being used increasingly often to generate a plan of a town site prior to excavation as a way of ensuring that the excavation can be used to address site-specific questions in a way that had not been possible before. Most recently, research has begun to reveal the advantages of integrating a range of different non-destructive techniques on urban sites. In combination with exciting new computer-based means of data visualization, all of this work means that it is now possible to virtually reconstruct a buried town within a relatively short space of time, as opposed to the old and destructive excavation-centered approach that could take generations. Unsurprisingly these advances are starting to make a very important understanding to urbanism in general and the Roman Empire in particular. Urban Landscape Survey in Italy and the Mediterranean builds upon all these new developments and is one of the first publications to focus exclusively upon the contribution of survey techniques to our understanding of ancient towns. It addresses methodology led enquiry into the nature of urban settlements primarily in Italy, but also in Greece, Turkey, Croatia, Portugal and Spain. The twenty-two papers from leading specialists in the field focus on two underlying themes. The first deals with the characterization of urban sites and draws upon a wide range of case studies. These range from key protohistoric centres in central and south Italy, to towns that epitomise the contradictions of cultural change under Rome, such as Paestum, Aquinum and Sagalassos, to Roman centres such as Teano, Suasa and Ammaia. The second theme is inter-urban relationships, looking in particular at wider urbanized landscapes in Italy. The fascinating selection of recent and on-going projects presented here significantly moves the limits of our current knowledge about ancient towns.",2012,
Deep Sparse Band Selection for Hyperspectral Face Recognition,"Hyperspectral imaging systems collect and process information from specific wavelengths across the electromagnetic spectrum. The fusion of multi-spectral bands in the visible spectrum has been exploited to improve face recognition performance over all the conventional broad band face images. In this book chapter, we propose a new Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) framework which adopts a structural sparsity learning technique to select the optimal spectral bands to obtain the best face recognition performance over all of the spectral bands. Specifically, in this method, images from all bands are fed to a CNN, and the convolutional filters in the first layer of the CNN are then regularized by employing a group Lasso algorithm to zero out the redundant bands during the training of the network. Contrary to other methods which usually select the useful bands manually or in a greedy fashion, our method selects the optimal spectral bands automatically to achieve the best face recognition performance over all spectral bands. Moreover, experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state of the art band selection methods for face recognition on several publicly-available hyperspectral face image datasets.",2019,ArXiv
An error bound for Lasso and Group Lasso in high dimensions,"We leverage recent advances in high-dimensional statistics to derive new L2 estimation upper bounds for Lasso and Group Lasso in high-dimensions. For Lasso, our bounds scale as $(k^*/n) \log(p/k^*)$---$n\times p$ is the size of the design matrix and $k^*$ the dimension of the ground truth $\boldsymbol{\beta}^*$---and match the optimal minimax rate. For Group Lasso, our bounds scale as $(s^*/n) \log\left( G / s^* \right) + m^* / n$---$G$ is the total number of groups and $m^*$ the number of coefficients in the $s^*$ groups which contain $\boldsymbol{\beta}^*$---and improve over existing results. We additionally show that when the signal is strongly group-sparse, Group Lasso is superior to Lasso.",2019,ArXiv
Asteroid: Earth Destroyer or New Frontier?,"Asteroids sling through space, celestial debris of diverse origins: leftovers from the formation of the solar system, broken offshoots of parental asteroids, or comets that have lost their glow. For the first time in a popular book, Patricia Barnes-Svarney discloses how some asteroids - rich in precious minerals such as gold and platinum - may one day be lassoed and mined by man. She also explores how the natural resources that abound in some asteroids could possibly support human life, leading to their colonization and use as space stations. One day, too, they may reveal to us the secrets of the origins of life. But if an asteroid merely one kilometer in diameter - about the size of eleven football fields end-to-end - were to smash into Earth, it would mean a global catastrophe. And if a larger asteroid - one the size of Vermont - were to strike, life on our planet would come to an end. We know that we've been struck before - from the large and small impact craters that dot the Earth's major land masses. If, as one theory states, the chance of a major collision is currently about one in ten thousand - similar to that of dying from anesthesia during surgery or of being killed in a car crash during any six-month interval - should we be living in fear? How could we possibly prepare ourselves for such a disaster? Patricia Barnes-Svarney, an asteroid enthusiast since childhood, asserts that the threat is real, and that there are better defenses than those now in place. In Asteroid, she vividly evokes both the perils and fascination of these heavenly bodies that have the power to yield untold rewards - and boundless destruction.",1996,
Renal and Electrolyte Disorders,"This compact book faithfully reflects its editor's keen interest in the union of physiology and clinical medicine. The text is equally divided between fluid and electrolyte matters and renal diseases. The first half begins with an excellent description of water balance and disturbances of serum sodium. Particular and informative attention is paid to mixed acid-base disturbances and to the interpretation of high and low anion gaps. A tightly written chapter on magnesium is a welcome contribution. A few minor criticisms can be made. Some of the branching designs in the figures are a bit wearying to the eye, and the occurrence of blurred type in those figures is distracting. The second half of the book contains excellent chapters on proteinuria and glomerular diseases by Glassock and others. Dr Glassock revives a long-forgotten suggestion that glomerular disease must be described on four levels, ie, etiology, pathogenesis, morphology, and clinical syndromes. This,",1981,JAMA
Assessment of the Efficiency of Hospitals Before and After the Implementation of Health Sector Evolution Plan in Iran Based on Pabon Lasso Model,"BACKGROUND
Pabon Lasso model was applied to assess the relative performance of hospitals affiliated to Kurdistan University of Medical Sciences (KUMS) before and after the implementation of Health Sector Evolution Plan (HSEP) in Iran.


METHODS
This cross-sectional study was carried out in 11 public hospitals affiliated to KUMS in 2015. Twelve months before and after the implementation of the first phase of HSEP, a checklist was used to collect data from computerized databases within the hospitals' admission and discharge units. Pabon Lasso model includes three indices: bed turnover, bed occupancy ratio, and average length of stay.


RESULTS
Analysis of hospital performance showed an increase in mean of bed occupancy and turnover ratio, which changed from 65.40% and 86.22 times/year during 12 months before to 69.97% and 90.98 times/year during 12 months after HSEP, respectively. In line with Pabon Lasso model, before the implementation of HSEP, 27.27% and 36.36% of the hospitals were entirely efficient and inefficient, respectively, whilst after the implementation of HSEP, their condition changed to 18.18% and 27.27%, in order.


CONCLUSION
Indicators of bed occupancy and turnover ratio had a 4% increase in the studied hospitals after the implementation of HSEP. Number of the hospitals in the efficient zone reduced because of the relative measurement of efficiency by Pabon Lasso model. Since more than 50% of the hospitals in the studied province have not yet reached their optimal bed occupancy ratio (more than 70%), short-term and suitable strategy for improving the efficiency is to stop further expansion of hospitals as well as developing the number of hospital beds.",2017,Iranian Journal of Public Health
Asynchronous Decentralized Successive Convex Approximation.,"We study decentralized asynchronous multiagent optimization over networks, modeled as static (possibly directed) graphs. The optimization problem consists of minimizing a (possibly nonconvex) smooth function--the sum of the agents' local costs--plus a convex (possibly nonsmooth) regularizer, subject to convex constraints. Agents can perform their local computations as well as communicate with their immediate neighbors at any time, without any form of coordination or centralized scheduling; furthermore, when solving their local subproblems, they can use outdated information from their neighbors. We propose the first distributed asynchronous algorithm, termed ASY-DSCA, that converges at an R-linear rate to the optimal solution of convex problems whose objective function satisfies a general error bound condition; this condition is weaker than the more frequently used strong convexity, and it is satisfied by several empirical risk functions that are not strongly convex; examples include LASSO and logistic regression problems. When the objective function is nonconvex, ASY-DSCA converges to a stationary solution of the problem at a sublinear rate.",2019,arXiv: Optimization and Control
Los jesuitas expulsos en el viaje a Italia de NicolÃ¡s RodrÃ­guez Lasso (1788-1789),"The Hellenist Nicolas Rodriguez Lasso travelled to Italy between May 1788 and June 1789.

Isolation and characterization of polyaromatic hydrocarbons-degrading bacteria from different Qatari soils,"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-degrading bacteria were isolated from contaminated soil samples collected from the industrial zone at Umm-Saied city, state of Qatar. Isolation was occurred by enrichment using naphthalene, phenanthrene or anthracene as the sole source of carbon and energy. The isolates were characterized using a variety of phenotypic, morphologic and molecular properties. Three isolates showed the highest growths during screening as demonstrated by the increase in their optical densities (OD600) were selected for further studies. The isolates showed a concentrationdependent growth in all examined PAH-compounds they grew in. There were visible changes in the color of the growth medium of the isolates during their incubation, suggesting the production of different metabolites. Each isolate of them was able to grow on the three tested PAH compounds. Molecular identification of the isolates based on partial 16S rDNA gene sequences assigned them to Pseudomonas geniculata and Achromobacter xylosoxidans, respectively. This study indicates that the contaminated soil samples contain a diverse population of PAH-degrading bacteria and the use of soilassociated microorganisms has the potential for bioremediation of PAH contaminated sites.",2009,
The simplified isotopic microtest: a method for studying the susceptibility in vitro of Plasmodium falciparum to antimalarial drugs.,"We evaluated the efficiency of the simplified version of the isotopic microtest (simplified test) and compared it to that of the complete version (standard test), for determining the susceptibility of local strains of Plasmodium falciparum to chloroquine, quinine, mefloquine and halofantrine. The study was carried out from July to November 1996, at the MURAZ Center, Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso. The inclusion criteria were: single infection with P. falciparum, with a parasite count of at least 4,000 infected red blood cells per mm3. Susceptibility to each drug was determined after incubation for 48 hours at 37Â° C, in 5% CO2/95% air. Hypoxanthine (3H) was added to the medium to monitor parasite growth. Previous studies with the isotopic microtest defined threshold values for each of the antimalarial drugs tested. The simplified test involved measuring parasite growth at a single drug concentration, in triplicate, using 50 Âµl per well. We found no significant difference (Chi2 test) between the two techniques in terms of the response of P. falciparum to antimalarial drugs. All isolates tested were susceptible to quinine (n=128) and mefloquine (n=129) in both types of microtest. There was a 2.9% difference between the results of the standard and simplified tests. We found no significant increase in the prevalence of chloroquine-resistant strains of P. falciparum in the study area. This simplified test had high diagnostic value (sensitivity, specificity and kappa) and may be used for the monitoring in vitro of Plasmodium falciparum susceptibility in countries in which malaria is endemic.",2000,
A multidimensional shrinkage-thresholding operator,"The scalar shrinkage-thresholding operator (SSTO) is a key ingredient of many modern statistical signal processing algorithms including: sparse inverse problem solutions, wavelet denoising, and JPEG2000 image compression. In these applications, it is customary to select the threshold of the operator by solving a scalar sparsity penalized quadratic optimization. In this work, we present a natural multidimensional extension of the scalar shrinkage thresholding operator. Similarly to the scalar case, the threshold is determined by the minimization of a convex quadratic form plus an euclidean penalty, however, here the optimization is performed over a domain of dimension N â‰¥ 1. The solution to this convex optimization problem is called the multidimensional shrinkage threshold operator (MSTO). The MSTO reduces to the standard SSTO in the special case of N = 1. In the general case of N â‰« 1 the optimal MSTO threshold can be found by a simple convex line search. We present three illustrative applications of the MSTO in the context of non-linear regression: l2-penalized linear regression, Group LASSO linear regression and Group LASSO logistic regression.",2009,2009 IEEE/SP 15th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing
On Selecting Stable Predictors in Time Series Models,"We extend the feature selection methodology to dependent data and propose a novel time series predictor selection scheme that accommodates statistical dependence in a more typical i.i.d sub-sampling based framework. Furthermore, the machinery of mixing stationary processes allows us to quantify the improvements of our approach over any base predictor selection method (such as lasso) even in a finite sample setting. Using the lasso as a base procedure we demonstrate the applicability of our methods to simulated and several real time series datasets.",2019,ArXiv
Hierarchical Bayesian models in ecology: Reconstructing species interaction networks from non-homogeneous species abundance data,"article i nfo The relationships among organisms and their surroundings can be of immense complexity. To describe and understand an ecosystem as a tangled bank, multiple ways of interaction and their effects have to be considered, suchaspredation,competition,mutualismandfacilitation.Understandingtheresultinginteractionnetworksisa challenge in changing environments, e.g. to predict knock-on effects of invasive species and to understand how climate change impacts biodiversity. The elucidation of complex ecological systems with their interactions will benefit enormously from the development of new machine learning tools that aim to infer the structure of inter- actionnetworks from fielddata.Inthe presentstudy,wepropose a novel Bayesian regressionand multiplechan- gepoint model (BRAM) for reconstructing species interaction networks from observed species distributions. The model has been devised to allow robust inference in the presence of spatial autocorrelation and distributional heterogeneity. We have evaluated the model on simulated data that combines a trophic niche model with a stochastic population model on a 2-dimensional lattice, and we have compared the performance of our model with L1-penalized sparse regression (LASSO) and non-linear Bayesian networks with the BDe scoring scheme. In addition, we have applied our method to plant ground coverage data from the western shore of the Outer Hebrides with the objective to infer the ecological interactions.",2012,Ecol. Informatics
On the second-order theory of the dielectric response function and of the spin susceptibility of the electron gas,"Abstract We complete an expression of the dielectric response function Ï‡( Q , Ï‰) of the electron gas, which has been derived in an earlier paper and derive to the same order the longitudinal spin response function Ï‡ zz ( Q , Ï‰). The local field corrections of these response functions will be discussed in the large wave number limit. Using exact relations of Niklasson and of Zhou and Overhauser we obtain the value of the pair distribution function g ( r ) at r = 0 in agreement with Kimball's result. Further we answer to some criticism concerning earlier work, raised recently in this journal.",1990,Physica B-condensed Matter
Caulosegnins I-III: a highly diverse group of lasso peptides derived from a single biosynthetic gene cluster.,"Lasso peptides are natural products of ribosomal origin with a unique knotted structural fold. Even though only a few of them are known, recent reports of newly isolated lasso peptides were scarce. In this work, we report the identification of a novel lasso peptide gene cluster from Caulobacter segnis, that produces three new lasso peptides (caulosegnins I, II, and III) using a single biosynthetic machinery. These lasso peptides possess different ring sizes and amino acid sequences. In this study, we have developed a system for enhanced lasso peptide production to allow isolation of these compounds through heterologous expression in Escherichia coli. We were able to elucidate the structure of the most abundant lasso peptide caulosegnin I via NMR spectroscopic analysis and performed a thorough mutational analysis that gave insight into their biosynthesis and revealed important factors affecting the stabilization of the lasso fold in general. The caulosegnins also show a diverse behavior when subjected to thermal denaturation, which is exceptional as all lasso peptides were believed to have an intrinsic high thermal stability.",2013,Journal of the American Chemical Society
Quasi-Likelihood and/or Robust Estimation in High Dimensions,"We consider the theory for the high-dimensional generalized linear model with the Lasso. After a short review on theoretical results in literature, we present an extension of the oracle results to the case of quasi-likelihood loss. We prove bounds for the prediction error and $\ell_1$-error. The results are derived under fourth moment conditions on the error distribution. The case of robust loss is also given. We moreover show that under an irrepresentable condition, the $\ell_1$-penalized quasi-likelihood estimator has no false positives.",2012,Statistical Science
Non-linear association of plasma level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol with endobronchial biopsy bleeding in patients with lung cancer,"BackgroundDespite a large body of studies have demonstrated the multifaceted behavior of high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) in several physiological and pathological processes, the levels of plasma HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) that may be associated with endobronchial biopsy (EBB)-related bleeding have never been examined.MethodsWe conducted a single-center retrospective cohort study of 628 consecutive patients with primary lung cancer who had undergone EBB at a large tertiary hospital between January 2014 and February 2018. Patients were divided into the bleeding group and the non-bleeding group according to the bronchoscopy report. The association between HDL-C levels and EBB-induced bleeding was evaluated using the LASSO regression analysis, multiple regression analysis and smooth curve fitting adjusted for potential confounders.ResultsThere was an inverse association of plasma HDL-C concentration with the incidence of EBB-induced bleeding as assessed by univariate analysis (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). However, in piecewise linear regression analysis, a non-linear relationship with threshold saturation effects was observed between plasma HDL-C concentrations and EBB-induced bleeding. The incidence of EBB-induced bleeding decreased with HDL-C concentrations from 1.5â€‰mmol/L up to 2.0â€‰mmol/L (adjusted OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.20â€“0.74), but increased with HDL-C levels above the inflection point (HDL-Câ€‰=â€‰2.0â€‰mmol/L).ConclusionsThere was a non-linear association between plasma HDL-C concentrations and the risk of EBB-induced bleeding in patients with lung cancer. The plasma level of HDL-C above 2.0â€‰mmol/L or below 1.5â€‰mmol/L may increase the risk of EBB-induced bleeding.",2019,Lipids in Health and Disease

Letter to the Editor,"To The Editor: In an interesting case report, Borum and Ginsberg published a seve re hype rsensitivity reaction to 5-aminosalicycli c acid (5-ASA) suppositorie s in a patient with proctosigmoid itis, adding furthe r proof to the contention that the 5-ASA therapy in rare cases may produce clinically relevant side effects (1). In search for additional, potentially serious side effects, we found a paper demonstrating a dose-dependent relationship between methyl or ethyl acrylate resins (Eudragit L) and the occurrence of Â® brosing colonopathy in animals (2). As certain slow-re lease 5-ASA preparations used in the treatment of in Ì„ ammatory bowel disease (IBD) contain Eudragit Lbased coating (Claversal, Mesasal, Salofalk) (3), we wondered whether Â® brosing colonopathy may occur during treatment with such 5-ASA preparations. For this purpose we unde rtook a compute r-assisted search through the major database s starting from 1985. Besides the above quoted reference, no furthe r re ports de scribing 5-ASA and/or Eudragit Lassociate d colonopathy were found. There is, therefore, no evidence that therapy with Eudragit L containing 5-ASA compounds is associate d with Â® brosing colonpathy. This view is corroborated by a recent paper showing almost similar odds ratios to deve lop Â® brosing colonopathy in childre n with cystic Â® brosis on pancreatic enzyme substitution with and without Eudragit L coating (4). The Â® nal answer, however, only will come from furthe r appropriate ly designed clinical studies. A clear distinction between colonic stricture s due to the in Ì„ ammatory process from those caused by drug therapy may be difÂ® cult. Despite these limitations, further inve stigation of stricture formation in cystic Â® brosis and IBD is a clinically important area with a varie ty of factors recently shown to modify stricture formation in IBD such as cytokine s (5), prostaglandins (6), and phosphatidylcholine (7).

SnO2 thin films prepared by the sol-gel process,"Abstract SnO 2 thin films were prepared by the sol-gel process using an alcoholic solution of Sn(OC 2 H 5 ) 4 2C 2 H 5 OH as the precursor. Aftersubsequent annealing, the temperature of which was varied according to the substrate (oxidised silicon, glassor ceramic glass), the films were characterised by scanning electron microscopy, electron diffraction and Augerelectron spectroscopy. The sensitivity of these films to variations in humidity was established for values in the range 0% to 93% relative humidity.",1997,Thin Solid Films
