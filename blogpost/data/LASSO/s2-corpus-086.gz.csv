Molecular Epidemiology of High-Risk Human Papilloma Virus Infection in Sexually Active Women at Bobo-Dioulasso University Teaching Hospital,"The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of HPV-HR genotypes 
in the population of sexually active women in Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso. Methods: This study took place at Souro Sanou Teaching Hospital in Bobo-Dioulasso 
from September to June 2017. A total of 234 women in the gynecological period 
and also sexually active were enrolled after they gave an individual consent. 
Swabbing of the endocervical canal was done. From the sample stored at -20Â°C, 
the viral DNA was extracted using the â€œDNA-Sorb-Aâ€ kit from SACACE 
biotechnologiesÂ®. Amplification of the PCR of the extracted DNA was made, using 
the â€œHPV Genotypes 14 Real-TM Quantâ€ V67-100 FRT kit. Data were analyzed with 
SPSS software version 17.0 and Epi Info 6. Chi-square and Fisherâ€™s tests were 
used to compare proportions and averages; a link was significant when p 0.05. Results: The mean age was 30.7 Â± 7.3 years (median: 30 years); 84.5% of them were 
married, 43.5% had a socio-professional activity and 61% were schooled. A total of 20.6% of women 
were positive for at least one of the following HPV-HR genotypes: HPV 18, 31, 
35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66, and 68. Genotypes the most frequently found 
were HPV 52 with 11 cases (17.2%) and 66 with 10 cases (15.6%). Conclusion: Our results show a predominance of HPV-HR genotypes 
not covered by available vaccines. Mapping genotypes are needed to fully understand viral ecology at the national level. But for 
instance, the nonavalent vaccine, which has a better coverage of the predominant 
genotypes, is to be promoted.",2019,Open Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology
Assessing Performance of Kerman Province`s Hospitals Using Pabon Lasso Diagram between 2008 and 2010,"Background: A method of performance assessment is required to improve Productivity and reduce hospital costs . Pabon Lasso diagram is known as a tool for performance assessment. The current study is aimed to assess and compare Kerman province`s hospitals performance by using Pabon Lasso diagram. Materials & Methods: This descriptive and cross-sectional study was conducted retrospectively between 2008 and 2010. All hospitals of Kerman province in three groups of public, social security and private were selected by census method (N=23). The data were gathered from statistics unit and entered into SPSS 18.0. Three indicators include bed occupancy rate, bed turnover and average of length of stay were calculated and then hospitals` performance were analyzed by Pabon Lasso diagram. Results: In first two years, seven and eight hospitals out of twenty-three and in third year nine hospitals out of twenty-two located in third zone of the model (desired productivity) respectively. Among all hospitals, regarding number and ownership type, social security hospitals had better performance in 2008. Additionally Public hospitals had better performance than others in 2009 and 2010,. Conclusion: Public hospitals had better performance.Although studied hospitals` performance experienced growing trend, only one third of the them had desired performance. It can be caused by changing the provided services type from inpatient to outpatient services.It seems that Considering type of ownership and assessing past trend of 3 studied indicators concurrently is necessary for Planning for development of a broader range of inpatient services and diversified medical services based on province`s need.",2014,Journal of Hospital
AdaPtive Noisy Data Augmentation for Regularized Estimation of Undirected Graphical Models,"We propose an AdaPtive Noise Augmentation (PANDA) technique to regularize the estimation and construction of undirected graphical models. PANDA iteratively optimizes the objective function given the noise augmented data until convergence to achieve regularization on model parameters. The augmented noises can be designed to achieve various regularization effects on graph estimation, such as the bridge (including lasso and ridge), elastic net, adaptive lasso, and SCAD penalization; it also realizes the group lasso and fused ridge. We examine the tail bound of the noise-augmented loss function and establish that the noiseaugmented loss function and its minimizer converge almost surely to the expected penalized loss function and its minimizer, respectively. We derive the asymptotic distributions for the regularized parameters through PANDA in generalized linear models, based on which, inferences for the parameters can be obtained simultaneously with variable selection. We show the non-inferior performance of PANDA in constructing graphs of different types in simulation studies and apply PANDA to an autism spectrum disorder data to construct a mixed-node graph. We also show that the inferences based on the asymptotic distribution of regularized parameter estimates via PANDA achieve nominal or near-nominal coverage and are far more efficient, compared to some existing post-selection procedures. Computationally, PANDA can be easily programmed in software that implements (GLMs) without resorting to complicated optimization techniques. keywords: adjacency matrix, augmented Fisher information, generalized linear model (GLM), maximum a posterior estimation, sparsity, inference âˆ—Corresponding author email: fang.liu.131@nd.edu 1 ar X iv :1 81 0. 04 85 1v 2 [ st at .M L ] 2 1 M ay 2 01 9",2019,
Stability of growth in strength and motor performance from childhood to adolescence.,"THERE is widespread belief that boys and girls who are stronger and more proficient than their peers in physical skills in childhood will retain this superiority in the years to come. Evidence in support of this is at best meager. In fact, only limited study has been made of the predictability of growth in muscular strength and motor performance during the growing years. The few investigations in which strength measurements have been taken on the same children over a period of several years have shown only moderately high between-year correlations. For example, Baldwin (1920) found correlations of .65 for boys and .45 for girls between grip strength at 9 and 10 years of age and grip strength taken again six years later on the same children. Similarly, Tuddenham and Snyder (1954) reported between-year correlations, age 9 to 18 years, of .63 for boys and .57 for girls, for a composite strength score (sum of right and left grip, pull and thrust). Only a few reports have been published on the stability of growth in gross motor skills over extended periods of time. Using longitudinal data, Glassowand Kruse (1960) reported between year correlations (grade 1 to grade 6) of 7.02 for the 30-yard dash and .739 for the standing broad jump. Espenschade (1940) found that between year correlations (age 13 to age 16) on such events as the 50-yard dash, the standing broad jump, jump and reach, throw for distance, Brace test, and target throw ranged from .29 in the dash to .66 in the Brace test for boys and from .36 in the target throw to .84 in the distance throw for girls. On the basis of the limited data available, one might hypothesize that higher order responses such as complex motor skills are more susceptible to varying environmental influences than muscular strength and hence correlations over time are likely to be lower for the former than for the latter. The present investigation was designed to examine the stability of growth in dynamometric muscular strength and motor performance",1967,Human Biology

Nomogram-based prediction of rebleeding in small bowel bleeding patients: the â€˜PRSBBâ€™ score,"Small bowel capsule endoscopy (SBCE) and balloon-assisted endoscopy (BAE) have revolutionized the diagnosis and treatment of small bowel bleeding (SBB), allowing access to the small bowel and identification of specific bleeding lesions. However, some patients experience rebleeding after small bowel investigation, and there are no definitive algorithms for determining the most appropriate follow-up strategy in SBB patients. We developed and validated a nomogram that can predict rebleeding risk and be used to develop a risk-stratified follow-up strategy in SBB patients. A retrospective study was performed using data from 401 SBB patients who underwent SBCE at Nagoya University Hospital. We developed and internally validated a predictive model for rebleeding in the form of a nomogram using Cox regression models and a bootstrap resampling procedure. Optimal risk factors were selected according to the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). The LASSO method identified 8 independent predictors of rebleeding that could be assessed to obtain a â€˜predicting rebleeding in SBBâ€™, or â€˜PRSBBâ€™ score: age, sex, SBB type, transfusion requirement, cardiovascular disease, liver cirrhosis, SBCE findings, and treatment. The c-statistic for the predictive model was 0.681. In conclusion, our PRSBB score can help clinicians devise appropriate follow-up plans.",2018,Scientific Reports
Predictive Modelling of Home Appliances Energy Consumption in Belgium,"The increasing trend in energy consumption is becoming cause of concern for the entire world, as the energy consumption is increasing year after year so is the carbon and greenhouse gas emission, the majority portion of the electricity generated is consumed by industrial sector but a considerable amount is also consumed by residential sector. It is important to study the energy consuming behaviour in the residential sector and predict the energy consumption by home appliances as it consume maximum amount of energy in the residence. The European energy goal of 2020 is to reduce the energy consumption and carbon emission by 20%. This project focuses on predicting the energy consumption of home appliances based on humidity and temperature. It has resulted in implementation of five prediction regression models, i.e. multiple regression, lasso regression, ridge regression, SVM regression and Random Forest are developed and results are presented based on RMSE, MAE and MAPE, the dataset for the analysis was taken from a house located in Stambruges (Belgium), keeping European goal of 2020 in mind. In addition the results of reviewed literature of home energy consumption in Europe is also presented.",2018,
Efficient Regularized Regression with L 0 Penalty for Variable Selection and Network Construction,"Variable selections for regression with high-dimensional big data have found many applications in bioinformatics and computational biology. One appealing approach is the L0 regularized regression which penalizes the number of nonzero features in the model directly. However, it is well known that L0 optimization is NP-hard and computationally challenging. In this paper, we propose efficient EM (L0EM) and dual L0EM (DL0EM) algorithms that directly approximate the L0 optimization problem. While L0EM is efficient with large sample size, DL0EM is efficient with high-dimensional (n â‰ª m) data. They also provide a natural solution to all Lp â€‰â€‰p âˆˆ [0,2] problems, including lasso with p = 1 and elastic net with p âˆˆ [1,2]. The regularized parameter Î» can be determined through cross validation or AIC and BIC. We demonstrate our methods through simulation and high-dimensional genomic data. The results indicate that L0 has better performance than lasso, SCAD, and MC+, and L0 with AIC or BIC has similar performance as computationally intensive cross validation. The proposed algorithms are efficient in identifying the nonzero variables with less bias and constructing biologically important networks with high-dimensional big data.",2016,Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine
"Annual Report 3 January 31 , 2013","The problem of estimating high-dimensional network models arises naturally in the analysis of many biological and socio-economic systems. In this work, we aim to learn a network structure from temporal panel data, employing the framework of Granger causal models under the assumptions of sparsity of its edges and inherent grouping structure among its nodes. To that end, we introduce a group lasso regression regularization framework, and also examine a thresholded variant to address the issue of group misspecification. Further, the norm consistency and variable selection consistency of the estimates is established, the latter under the novel concept of direction consistency. The performance of the proposed methodology is assessed through an extensive set of simulation studies and comparisons with existing techniques. The study is illustrated on two motivating examples coming from functional genomics and financial econometrics.",2013,
A Review of the Fossil Record of Turtles of the Clade Thalassochelydia,"Abstract 
 The Late Jurassic (Oxfordian to Tithonian) fossil record of Europe and South America has yielded a particularly rich assemblage of aquatic pan-cryptodiran turtles that are herein tentatively hypothesized to form a monophyletic group named Thalassochelydia. Thalassochelydians were traditionally referred to three families, Eurysternidae, Plesiochelyidae, and Thalassemydidae, but the current understanding of phylogenetic relationships is insufficient to support the monophyly of either group. Given their pervasive usage in the literature, however, these three names are herein retained informally. Relationships with marine turtles from the Cretaceous have been suggested in the past, but these hypotheses still lack strong character support. Thalassochelydians are universally found in near-shore marine sediments and show adaptations to aquatic habitats, but isotopic evidence hints at a broad spectrum of specializations ranging from freshwater aquatic to fully marine. A taxonomic review of the group concludes that of 68 named taxa, 27 are nomina valida, 18 are nomina invalida, 18 are nomina dubia, and 5 nomina oblita.",2017,Bulletin of the Peabody Museum of Natural History

The order Kiloniellales,"The Kiloniellaceae family is represented currently by a single genus Kiloniella with the species Kiloniella laminariae as type species. Kiloniella laminariae was isolated from the marine macroalga Saccharina latissima (former Laminaria saccharina) obtained from the Baltic Sea. The bacterium is a mesophilic, typical marine bacterium. It is a chemoheterotrophic aerobic bacterium with the potential of denitrification. Growth optima are at 25 Â°C, pH 5.5, and 3 % NaCl. The distinguished phylogenetic position separates Kiloniella from other alphaproteobacterial orders. The 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed a distant relationship to species of several orders of the Alphaproteobacteria with less than 91 % sequence similarity. This gives rise to the recognition of Kiloniella as a representative of a new order of the Alphaproteobacteria, the Kiloniellales. Phylogenetic analyses revealed a distinct cluster of Kiloniella with an uncharacterized bacterium (isolate KOPRI 13522) from hydrothermal plumes. This cluster forms a larger group together with the distantly related Terasakiella pusilla (88.4 % sequence similarity of the 16S rRNA gene) and the Thalassospira species (88.9â€“90.2 % sequence similarity). These genera are supposed to form separate families within the Kiloniellales.",2014,
Relating resting-state fMRI and EEG brain connectivity across frequency bands,"Audience: To those interested in the relationship between resting-state EEG and fMRI connectivity. Purpose: It has been shown that the resting-state (rs) networks observed with fMRI reflect electrophysiological activity [1-3]. However, questions remain regarding which EEG features most closely reflect rs-fMRI networks. For example, significant spatial agreement with fMRI derived networks emerged from MEG data filtered in the Î² and Î± frequency bands [1, 2]. Whereas, work in anesthetised animals with intracranial EEG suggested that the rs-fMRI signal correlated with the EEG power coherence in low-frequency bands [3]. We relate the covariance structure of the Hilbert envelope of the source localised electrophysiological signal to the covariance matrices derived from rs-fMRI. This allows direct comparison of EEG and fMRI connectivity. Statistical inference has been shown to be a useful tool in examining the relationship between brain connectivity variables [4, 5]. We use statistical inference based on sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis (sCCA) [6] to predict EEG brain connectivity from fMRI connectivity and vice-versa and we identify the most prominent connections that contribute to this relationship. Methods: Simultaneous EEG-fMRI was acquired from 17 adult volunteers. Scalp EEG was recorded using a 64-channel MR-compatible electrode cap (BrainCap MR). A T2*-weighted gradient-echo EPI sequence with 300 volumes was acquired at 1.5T: TR/TE=2160/30 msec, 30 slices with thickness 3.0 mm (1mm gap), effective voxel size 4.0Ã—3.3Ã—3.3 mm, flip angle 75, FOV 210Ã—210Ã—120 mm. A T1-weighted structural image was also obtained. EEG was corrected for scanner and cardiac pulse related artefacts using Brain Vision Analyzer 2. It was down-sampled to 250 Hz and frequency filtered into five bands: Î´(1-4Hz), Î¸(4-8Hz), Î±(8-13Hz), Î²(13-30Hz) and Î³(30-70Hz). Frequency filtered EEG data were projected into source space using beamforming as implemented in SPM12b [2, 7]. The signal was segmented into (fMRI) TR epochs. The average envelope of the signal was estimated for each segment based on the absolute value of the Hilbert transform. Preprocessing of the fMRI data involves removing the first five volumes, motion correction, low pass filtering and spatial smoothing with FSL. Both pre-processed fMRI and the averaged envelope of the EEG signals were averaged within cortical gray matter regions derived from Freesurferâ€™s anatomical parcellation of the T1-weighted image. For this reason, the Freesurfer parcellation was propagated to native fMRI and MNI space, respectively, with non-rigid registration. For each cortical region, the fMRI signal is averaged across all voxels, whereas the EEG signal is projected from sensor space to points randomly drawn from the region. The regionâ€™s centre of mass is always included whereas the number of points is proportional to regionâ€™s volume. Connectivity matrices were derived based on the precision matrix, the inverse of covariance of the averaged time series signal. This reflects partial correlation and it has been estimated based on a shrinkage approach [8]. We use sCCA to learn sparse vectors , that maximize the linear relationship between EEG ( ) and rsfMRI ( ) connectivity data as in eq.1 [6]. Sparsity is achieved based on lasso penalties , that result in simultaneous multivariate dimensionality reduction and selection of the most relevant connections. Subsequently, rs-fMRI connectivity is predicted from an unseen EEG connectivity matrix according to eq.2. Viceversa EEG ( ) connectivity can be predicted from rs-fMRI connectivity ( ), eq.3. is a diagonal matrix with the canonical correlation scores. We estimated the similarity between connectivity matrices based on a distance metric that quantifies differences in the space of covariance matrices as in eq.4 [4, 5, 9].",2013,

From Ethical Principles to Response-Able Practice:,"Chapter 3 of When Species Meet opens with a fictional encounter between a laboratory animal caretaker and the guinea pigs he works with. The laboratory is used to research sleeping sickness in cattle. As part of the experimental process, guinea pigs are shaved and placed in tight little baskets, wire cages filled with biting flies are placed over them, and their skins are painted with poisons to see if these sicken the flies. During a discussion with an observer (a young girl), the animal caretaker puts his arm into the cage. His arm is immediately covered by flies and starts to swell up. The man explains he does this to learn what the guinea pigs are suffering (page 69). For Donna Haraway, this moment captures a very different sense of what is meant by ethical practice, what she terms sharing suffering. Rather than looking towards higher guiding principles and rights to justify the pain and suffering felt by animal subjects during the experimental process, the ethical response she urges is about entangled subjectivities ` opening to shared pain and mortality and learning what that living and thinking teaches'' (page 83). Haraway's move here resonates with other moments where geographers, among others, have produced cartographies for a relational ethics. Firstly, it shifts the focus of ethics away from a singular Cartesian ethical subject, an autonomous individual capable of making rational ethical choices. For Haraway, abstract discussions of ethical principles are limited by working with human or animal individuals, ``the wrong units'' (page 70). In contrast, Haraway's concept of sharing suffering begins not with the expressed wishes of an individual, but with a relationship between the animal caretaker and his guinea pigs which seeks to share suffering. Sharing suffering is a collective not an individual achievement. As Jane Bennett might put it, this is a kind of agency which is ` distributed across multiple, overlapping bodies, disseminated in degreesorather than the capacity of a unitary subject of consciousness'' (2007, page 134). Similarly, the geographer Sarah Whatmore (1997) suggests that any ethical issue cannot be confined to one person, place, or procedure (like an informed consent), but needs to be `situated' in relation to a whole series of locations and agents. But in WSM Haraway also moves beyond a call for a more situated appreciation of ethical decision making. In her chapter on sharing suffering, ethics seems to take on more performative dimensions. The scientist in her opening vignette does not just think about the practices entangling his subjectivity with others, he performs them through sticking his hand in the cage and through the everyday practices of caring for and working with the guinea pigs. Here WSM is perhaps closer to some of the arguments made by nonrepresentational theory and its imperative to be attentive to processes exceeding the moment of (ethical) representation.Within geography, Derek McCormack's (2003) empirical account of a Dance Movement Therapy classoa therapy principled on a relationship between emotion and motionoalso describes a performative ethics. Here, rather than focusing on representing different ethical interests through a procedure (such as the signing of a consent form) ethics is articulated through touch, gesturing hands, and bodily movement. McCormack's account fleshes out what Haraway's ethic of sharing suffering might entail as an Environment and Planning D: Society and Space 2010, volume 28, pages 43 ^ 45",2010,Environment and Planning D-society & Space
Sparse Brain Network Recovery Under Compressed Sensing,"Partial correlation is a useful connectivity measure for brain networks, especially, when it is needed to remove the confounding effects in highly correlated networks. Since it is difficult to estimate the exact partial correlation under the small-n large-p situation, a sparseness constraint is generally introduced. In this paper, we consider the sparse linear regression model with a l1-norm penalty, also known as the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), for estimating sparse brain connectivity. LASSO is a well-known decoding algorithm in the compressed sensing (CS). The CS theory states that LASSO can reconstruct the exact sparse signal even from a small set of noisy measurements. We briefly show that the penalized linear regression for partial correlation estimation is related to CS. It opens a new possibility that the proposed framework can be used for a sparse brain network recovery. As an illustration, we construct sparse brain networks of 97 regions of interest (ROIs) obtained from FDG-PET imaging data for the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) children and the pediatric control (PedCon) subjects. As validation, we check the network reproducibilities by leave-one-out cross validation and compare the clustered structures derived from the brain networks of ASD and PedCon.",2011,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging
[Operative treatment of claw deformity by lassoplasty].,"OBJECTIVES
The aim is correction of claw deformity of the fingers by intrinsic paralysis.


INDICATIONS
Indications are claw deformity of fingers caused by palsy or functional loss of the interosseus or lumbrical muscles as far as the function of the superficial and deep flexors of the finger is intact.


CONTRAINDICATIONS
Contraindications are loss or paralysis of finger flexors supplied by the median nerve, fixed extension or flexion contracture of the finger joints, osteoarthritis and other malfunctions of the finger joints, no active flexion and extension of the interphalangeal joints due to compromised tendon gliding. Relative: Upper ulnar nerve palsy with functional loss of the deep flexor of the small and ring finger and possibly of the middle finger.


SURGICAL TECHNIQUE
The operation technique involves detachment of the flexor digitorum superficialis IV tendon (FDSÂ IV) distal to Camper's chiasm, division of the tendon into separate strips, interweaving of each tendon strip into the proximal part of the A2 pulley of the affected fingers. In cases of claw deformity of all fingers it may be advantageous to apply the superficial flexor tendon of the long finger in addition to the FDSÂ IV tendon as otherwise the FDSÂ IV tendon has to be divided into four strips resulting in relatively thin tendon strips. If the FDSÂ III and IV tendons are applied, the two strips of the FDSÂ IV tendon are used for lassoplasty of the small and ring fingers and the FDSÂ III tendon for lassoplasty of the middle and index fingers.


POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT
Postoperative management includes immobilization of the operated fingers by a dorsoulnar forearm plaster cast including the metacarpophalangeal joints which are flexed to 70Â°. After 2Â weeks replacement of the cast by a thermoplastic splint for another 4Â weeks. During the whole period exercises for the finger and thumb should be carried out.


RESULTS
From April 2003 to June 2012 a total of 17Â patients, 8Â female and 9Â male were surgically treated for claw deformity. The dominant hand was affected in seven patients. The average age was 46â€‰Â±â€‰15 (22-80) years, the average interval from onset of ulnar palsy to lassoplasty was 61â€‰Â±â€‰91 (3-288) months. The final follow-up was performed after an average of 42â€‰Â±â€‰32 (2-112) months. Claw deformity was resolved in 14 out of the 17Â patients. The grip strength was on average 58â€‰Â±â€‰28â€‰% (11-96Â %) of the unaffected hand, the mean disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand (DASH) score was 32â€‰Â±â€‰18 (5-68) points and the degree of patient satisfaction 7â€‰Â±â€‰2 (0-10). According to own results and those in the literature lassoplasty can be recommended for the treatment of claw deformity.",2013,Operative Orthopadie und Traumatologie
Generalized Reduced Error Logistic Regression Machine,"Reduced Error Logistic Regression (RELR) is a new form of regression that significantly reduces error in logit coefficients and outcome predictions. RELR leads to reliable variable shortlisting and stable parameter reduction processes that overcome the dual curses of dimensionality and complexity. RELR is fundamentally different from arbitrary regression coefficient smoothing methods like Lasso and Penalized Logistic Regression, as it models nonarbitrary error estimates. This paper will review this new supervised learning machine and show that it can perform decisively better than standard methods including Penalized Logistic Regression. RELR does not use validation sample information in training, so its reduced error compared to Penalized Logistic Regression is especially significant.",2008,
A flexible quantile regression model for medical costs with application to Medical Expenditure Panel Survey Study.,"Medical costs are often skewed to the right and heteroscedastic, having a sophisticated relation with covariates. Mean function regression models with low-dimensional covariates have been extensively considered in the literature. However, it is important to develop a robust alternative to find the underlying relationship between medical costs and high-dimensional covariates. In this paper, we propose a new quantile regression model to analyze medical costs. We also consider variable selection, using an adaptive lasso penalized variable selection method to identify significant factors of the covariates. Simulation studies are conducted to illustrate the performance of the estimation method. We apply our method to the analysis of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey dataset.",2018,Statistics in medicine
Frequency domain reconstruction of stochastically sampled signals based on compressive sensing,"The field of compressed sensing (CS) has recently been gaining traction as a viable workaround to the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem (NSST). This allows highly accurate signal recovery from incomplete frequency information. In this paper, we investigate the ability of compressive sampling to recover the higher harmonics of a recorded guitar signal. Sampling is done in the temporal domain, and the reconstruction is performed in the frequency domain. It is shown that even when taking a small number of random samples corresponding to some underlying sub-Nyquist rate, the base frequency, including up to fifth-order harmonics, can be recovered. The performance of three algorithms, namely least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP), and smoothed l0 norm (SL0) algorithm in terms of computation time and reconstruction error (cosine similarity) were investigated.",2019,
Applicazione dei laser scanner terrestri in campo agro-forestale e ambientale,"Le tecniche di laser scanning terrestre suscitano un interesse sempre piu crescente sia in campo ambientale sia in campo agro-forestale in quanto consentono unâ€™acquisizione rapida e affidabile di nuvole di punti 3D in grado di rappresentare tridimensionalmente gli oggetti rilevati. In un lasso di tempo relativamente breve, tali tecniche hanno aperto la strada ad un ampio spettro di applicazioni in pieno campo. Al di la della misura interattiva di nuvole georeferenziate di punti, le tecniche per il rilevamento automatizzato di oggetti, la determinazione delle loro caratteristiche geometriche e lâ€™analisi della risposta del segnale laser rappresentano temi di ricerca prioritari. Lâ€™elevata qualita delle nuvole di punti 3D generate dai sistemi di laser scanning insieme alla possibilita di automatizzare le successive post-elaborazioni dei dati hanno esteso il potenziale applicativo dei laser scanner terrestri anche ai settori ambientali e agro-forestali. Questo contributo illustra innanzitutto lo stato dellâ€™arte dei sistemi laser scanner terrestri dal punto di vista tecnologico e discute le diverse soluzioni tecnologiche e i diversi parametri di sistema in relazione alle possibili applicazioni in campo ambientale e forestale. Nella seconda parte saranno invece presentati alcuni casi di studio esplicativi delle potenzialita e delle limitazioni operative della tecnica di laser scanning terrestre in campo ambientale e agro-forestale. 
 
Terrestrial laser scanning techniques find rapidly growing interest in both environmental and agro-forestry fields as efficient tools for fast and reliable 3D point data acquisition and 3D representation of the object viewed by the scanners. They have opened a wide range of application fields within a rather short period of time. Beyond interactive measurement in 3D point clouds, techniques for the automatic detection of objects, the determination of geometric parameters, and the analysis of the reflectance signal form high priority research issues. The high quality of 3D point clouds generated by laser scanners and the data process automation potential make terrestrial laser scanning also an interesting tool for environmental and agro-forestry applications. The paper will first review current laser scanner systems from a technological point of view and discuss different scanner technologies and system parameters regarding their suitability for environmental and agro-forestry applications. In the second part of the paper, results of case studies on potentials and limitations of terrestrial laser scanners in environmental and agro-forestry fields will be presented.",2011,
Supervised group Lasso with applications to microarray data analysis,"BackgroundA tremendous amount of efforts have been devoted to identifying genes for diagnosis and prognosis of diseases using microarray gene expression data. It has been demonstrated that gene expression data have cluster structure, where the clusters consist of co-regulated genes which tend to have coordinated functions. However, most available statistical methods for gene selection do not take into consideration the cluster structure.ResultsWe propose a supervised group Lasso approach that takes into account the cluster structure in gene expression data for gene selection and predictive model building. For gene expression data without biological cluster information, we first divide genes into clusters using the K-means approach and determine the optimal number of clusters using the Gap method. The supervised group Lasso consists of two steps. In the first step, we identify important genes within each cluster using the Lasso method. In the second step, we select important clusters using the group Lasso. Tuning parameters are determined using V-fold cross validation at both steps to allow for further flexibility. Prediction performance is evaluated using leave-one-out cross validation. We apply the proposed method to disease classification and survival analysis with microarray data.ConclusionWe analyze four microarray data sets using the proposed approach: two cancer data sets with binary cancer occurrence as outcomes and two lymphoma data sets with survival outcomes. The results show that the proposed approach is capable of identifying a small number of influential gene clusters and important genes within those clusters, and has better prediction performance than existing methods.",2006,BMC Bioinformatics
On Penalty Parameter Selection for Estimating Network Models.,"Network models are gaining popularity as a way to estimate direct effects among psychological variables and investigate the structure of constructs. A key feature of network estimation is determining which edges are likely to be non-zero. In psychology, this is commonly achieved through the graphical lasso regularization method that estimates a precision matrix of Gaussian variables using an [Formula: see text]-penalty to push small values to zero. A tuning parameter, Î», controls the sparsity of the network. There are many methods to select Î», which can lead to vastly different graphs. The most common approach in psychological network applications is to minimize the extended Bayesian information criterion, but the consistency of this method for model selection has primarily been examined in high dimensional settings (i.e., nâ€‰<â€‰p) that are uncommon in psychology. Further, there is some evidence that alternative selection methods may have superior performance. Here, using simulation, we compare four different methods for selecting Î», including the stability approach to regularization selection (StARS), K-fold cross-validation, the rotation information criterion (RIC), and the extended Bayesian information criterion (EBIC). Our results demonstrate that penalty parameter selection should be made based on data characteristics and the inferential goal (e.g., to increase sensitivity versus to avoid false positives). We end with recommendations for selecting the penalty parameter when using the graphical lasso.",2019,Multivariate behavioral research

Dismantling and Recasting the Social Model During the Greek Great Depression,"L'attuale crisi rappresenta un punto di rottura per il modello sociale greco. I due Programmi di risanamento economico che sono seguiti alla crisi del debito sovrano del 2009 non hanno solo innescato una recessione economica guidata dallo Stato, ma hanno anche comportato una trasformazione radicale delle istituzioni del mercato del lavoro che esistevano prima della crisi, nonche del regime di welfare. Una serie ""infinita"" di riforme ha portato alla distruzione del regime giuridico di forte tutela dell'impiego, all'eliminazione della contrattazione collettiva, alla ristrutturazione del sistema previdenziale, alla riduzione del settore pubblico e a drastici tagli al welfare. Tali riforme radicali, sommate a una disoccupazione a livelli da depressione e al collasso di salari e redditi, hanno accentuato la precarieta e l'indigenza nel breve termine. Esse suggeriscono, inoltre, una transizione graduale verso un nuovo modello sociale basato su mercati del lavoro deregolamentati, una protezione sociale di tipo residuale e un nuovo partenariato pubblico-privato nelle prestazioni di welfare.",2014,
Sparsity in Principal Component Analysis:A Survey,"Principal component analysis(PCA) is a popular multivariate statistic technique.However,the principal component estimation is often inconsistent while the samples are high-dimensional,and the principal component meaning is unintelligible too.The above two difficulties can be partially overcome by variable selection with sparse constraints.The basic concept of sparsity and the design standard of penalties were described in this survey.A typical sparse constraint,lasso,was introduced as well as its related morphs:fused lasso,group lasso,adaptive lasso and elastic net.Any of these constraints can be added into PCA to build a framework of spars PCA,and the emphasis was on how to transform sparse PCA into a convex optimizing problem and quickly solve it.Many transforming styles on sparse PCA were compared:singular value decomposition,sparse regression,low rank matrix approximation,penalized matrix decomposition and semi-definite relaxations.The approaches to solving the common and generalized lasso problems were analyzed based on least angle regression(LAR).The element of sparse PCA in functional data was discussed as a prospect.",2012,
"Sparsity enforcing priors in inverse problems via Normal variance mixtures: model selection, algorithms and applications","The sparse structure of the solution for an inverse problem can be modelled using different sparsity enforcing priors when the Bayesian approach is considered. Analytical expression for the unknowns of the model can be obtained by building hierarchical models based on sparsity enforcing distributions expressed via conjugate priors. We consider heavy tailed distributions with this property: the Student-t distribution, which is expressed as a Normal scale mixture, with the mixing distribution the Inverse Gamma distribution, the Laplace distribution, which can also be expressed as a Normal scale mixture, with the mixing distribution the Exponential distribution or can be expressed as a Normal inverse scale mixture, with the mixing distribution the Inverse Gamma distribution, the Hyperbolic distribution, the Variance-Gamma distribution, the Normal-Inverse Gaussian distribution, all three expressed via conjugate distributions using the Generalized Hyperbolic distribution. For all distributions iterative algorithms are derived based on hierarchical models that account for the uncertainties of the forward model. For estimation, Maximum A Posterior (MAP) and Posterior Mean (PM) via variational Bayesian approximation (VBA) are used. The performances of resulting algorithm are compared in applications in 3D computed tomography (3D-CT) and chronobiology. Finally, a theoretical study is developed for comparison between sparsity enforcing algorithms obtained via the Bayesian approach and the sparsity enforcing algorithms issued from regularization techniques, like LASSO and some others.",2017,arXiv: Applications
IMS Collections Pushing the Limits of Contemporary Statistics : Contributions in Honor of,"We have developed a strategy for the analysis of newly available binary data to improve outcome predictions based on existing data (binary or non-binary). Our strategy involves two modeling approaches for the newly available data, one combining binary covariate selection via LASSO with logistic regression and one based on logic trees. The results of these models are then compared to the results of a model based on existing data with the objective of combining model results to achieve the most accurate predictions. The combination of model predictions is aided by the use of support vector machines to identify subspaces of the covariate space in which specific models lead to successful predictions. We demonstrate our approach in the analysis of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data and traditional clinical risk factors for the prediction of coronary heart disease.",2008,
Egg surface structure of the freshwater toadfish Thalassophryne amazonica (Teleostei: Batrachoididae) with information on its distribution and natural habitat,"The egg surface structure of Thalassophryne amazonica, a freshwater toadfish from the Amazon basin is described. Eggs of this species show a remarkable, highly unusual system of parallel ridges and intermittent grooves that originate at the equator of the egg and lead to the micropylar pit, at which they end in a spiralling pattern. A similar egg surface structure has so far been described only from a group of Asian anabantoid percomorphs, obviously not closely related to Thalassophryne. This egg surface pattern may enhance fertilization success by guiding sperm to the micropyle. We review museum records for T. amazonica, present an updated map of its occurrence in the Amazon basin, and provide information on its habitat.",2012,Neotropical Ichthyology
Combining Multi-Source Data and Machine Learning Approaches to Predict Winter Wheat Yield in the Conterminous United States,"Winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is one of the most important cereal crops, supplying essential food for the world population. Because the United States is a major producer and exporter of wheat to the world market, accurate and timely forecasting of wheat yield in the United States (U.S.) is fundamental to national crop management as well as global food security. Previous studies mainly have focused on developing empirical models using only satellite remote sensing images, while other yield determinants have not yet been adequately explored. In addition, these models are based on traditional statistical regression algorithms, while more advanced machine learning approaches have not been explored. This study used advanced machine learning algorithms to establish within-season yield prediction models for winter wheat using multi-source data to address these issues. Specifically, yield driving factors were extracted from four different data sources, including satellite images, climate data, soil maps, and historical yield records. Subsequently, two linear regression methods, including ordinary least square (OLS) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and four well-known machine learning methods, including support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), and deep neural network (DNN), were applied and compared for estimating the county-level winter wheat yield in the Conterminous United States (CONUS) within the growing season. Our models were trained on data from 2008 to 2016 and evaluated on data from 2017 and 2018, with the results demonstrating that the machine learning approaches performed better than the linear regression models, with the best performance being achieved using the AdaBoost model (R2=0.86, RMSE=0.51 t/ha, MAE=0.39 t/ha). Additionally, the results showed that combining data from multiple sources outperformed single source satellite data, with the highest accuracy being obtained when the four data sources were all considered in the model development. Finally, the prediction accuracy was also evaluated against timeliness within the growing season, with reliable predictions (R2>0.84) being able to be achieved 2.5 months before the harvest when the multi-source data were combined.",2020,Remote Sensing
Percutaneous closure for iatrogenic atrial septal defect composed of a hole with slit fenestration and patent foramen ovale after pulmonary vein isolation,"A 66-year-old man underwent pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) for atrial fibrillation. He had history of corpulmonale. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) before PVI revealed dilated right heart chamber and tricuspid regurgitation. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) before PVI revealed a short, slit-like patent foramen ovale (PFO) with continuous left-to-right shunt (Fig. 1a). PVI was performed using a â€˜single-puncture 3 sheaths methodsâ€™. We used an 8.5-Fr Agilis NxT sheath (Abbott, Chicago, IL, USA), 8.5Fr Swartz Braided SL0 sheath (Abbott), and 8.0-Fr Swartz Braided SL0 sheath (Abbott). First, the 8.5-Fr Agilis NxT sheath unintentionally crossed the PFO to the left atrium. Hence, the other sheaths were placed into the left atrium after septal puncture using a conventional Brockenbrough needle. PVI was successfully performed by double LASSO technique using LASSO catheters (Biosense-Webster, Diamond Bar, CA, USA). Two months after PVI, the patient was re-admitted to our hospital for decompensated biventricular failure. TEE revealed a bidirectional shunt through the septal defect (ASD) composed of a hole with slit fenestration and the PFO (Fig. 1b, c). The defect size was 10.8 Ã— 5.7 mm, measured by 3-dimensional (3D)-TEE (Fig. 1d). Mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure were 31 and 11 mmHg, respectively. Qp/Qs was 2.2, calculated by right heart catheterization (RHC). We performed percutaneous device closure for iatrogenic ASD and PFO by 12-mm Amplatzer Septal Occluder (Abbott; Fig. 1e, f). Iatrogenic ASD (iASD) is a common complication of transcatheterization performed transseptally [1, 2]. In addition, it is well documented that percutaneous closure for iASD is effective procedure. However, we suggest that PVI be carefully performed as iASD may become",2019,Cardiovascular Intervention and Therapeutics
Graftaneurysmen als Langzeitkomplikation einer Polyesterprothese und deren Management,"ZusammenfassungEinleitungEin materialassoziiertes echtes Aneurysma nach frÃ¼herer Prothesenverwendung zur arteriellen Rekonstruktion meist bei PAVK ist eine seltene, ernst zu nehmende Komplikation.Zielsetzung und MethodeZiel der vorliegenden kompakten KurzÃ¼bersicht ist, im Rahmen einer systematischen Literaturanalyse zu Nichtanastomosenaneurysmen in Dacron-Prothesen sowie den gewonnenen spezifischen Erfahrungen im erfolgreichen klinischen Fallmanagement das seltene Krankheitsbild eines echten Prothesenaneurysmas und seiner befundgerechten Versorgung inkl. eines reprÃ¤sentativen Kasus darzustellen.Ergebnisse (komplexe befund- und patientenassoziierte Eckpunkte und Fall)Ausgewertet wurden letztlich 20Â Publikationen von ursprÃ¼nglich 321 initial eruierten Quellen seit 1995. Am hÃ¤ufigsten traten Pseudoaneurysmen bei gestrickten Polyesterprothesen im femoropoplitealen Bereich nach durchschnittlich 12,9Â Jahren auf. In ungefÃ¤hr einem Drittel der beschriebenen FÃ¤lle fanden sich 2 und mehr Aneurysmen in den Dacron-Prothesen. Histologische und elektronenmikroskopische Untersuchungen beschreiben Ã¼berwiegend FilamentbrÃ¼che und FremdkÃ¶rperreaktionen. In mehr als der HÃ¤lfte der FÃ¤lle erfolgte die Resektion des Aneurysmas und die Rekonstruktion durch ein Interponat, nachrangig waren die Komplettentfernung und endovaskulÃ¤re Therapie.ReprÃ¤sentativer KasusBei einem 49-jÃ¤hrigen Patienten wurde 19Â Jahre nach Anlage eines P1-Dacron-Bypasses duplexsonographisch und komplementÃ¤r MR-angiographisch ein echtes Prothesenaneurysma am rechten Oberschenkel diagnostiziert, das erfolgreich mit einem Interponat mittels 8â€‘mm-Dacron-Prothese (Intergard Synergy Knitted, InterVascular GmbH, Bensheim, Deutschland) versorgt wurde.SchlussfolgerungDie Genese echter Prothesenaneurysmen ist noch immer nicht hinreichend geklÃ¤rt. Sie gehÃ¶ren â€“ wenn auch selten â€“ zum Profil von SpÃ¤tkomplikationen und sollten im postoperativen Dekadenintervall im diagnostisch-bildgebenden Verlaufsscreening mit abgeklÃ¤rt werden, wenn die frÃ¼here arterielle Rekanalisation/Rekonstruktion sequenziell nach endovaskulÃ¤rer Intervention und venenbasierter Rekonstruktion nicht anders als mit Prothesenmaterial erfolgen konnte.AbstractIntroductionAÂ material-associated true aneurysm after previous use of aÂ vascular prosthesis for arterial reconstruction mostly in peripheral arterial occlusion disease (PAOD) is considered aÂ rare but serious complication.Aim and methodThe aim of the compact brief review was to describe the rare finding of aÂ true aneurysm of a prosthesis and its diagnosis-specific care including aÂ representative scientific case report, based on selected topic-related references from the medical literature as well as the specific experiences obtained from the successful clinical management in single cases.Results (complex key points associated with patient and clinical findings and case presentation)Out of initially 321 references found in the literature search, 20 articles published after 1995 were finally evaluated. Most frequently, pseudoaneurysms of knitted polyester prostheses at the femoropopliteal segment occurred on average after approximately 12.9Â years. In one third of the cases two or more aneurysms of Dacron prostheses were described. Histological and electron microscopy investigations revealed mainly breakage of filaments and foreign body reactions. In more than half of the patients, the aneurysm was resected and for reconstruction an interposition graft was implanted. Complete removal of the prosthesis and endovascular treatment were only second choice.Representative caseAÂ 49-year-old male patient underwent aÂ femoropopliteal P1 prosthetic bypass of the right leg in 1997. After 19Â years aÂ true aneurysm of the prosthesis was diagnosed in the right thigh using duplex ultrasonography and complementary magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). This was successfully treated with resection of the aneurysm and insertion of an 8â€‘mm Dacron prosthesis (Intergard Synergy Knitted, InterVascular, Bensheim, Germany).ConclusionThe development of true aneurysms of prostheses has not yet been satisfactorily clarified. This belongs to the profile of late complications, even if rarely and should be controlled after aÂ postoperative interval of approximately one decade. This should be carried out by diagnostic imaging follow-up screening if the previous arterial recanalization/reconstruction could not be performed sequentially following endovascular intervention and venous-based reconstruction, other than with prosthetic material.",2017,Der Chirurg
Sparse Tensor Discriminant Color Space for Face Verification,"As one of the fundamental features, color provides useful information and plays an important role for face recognition. Generally, the choice of a color space is different for different visual tasks. How can a color space be sought for the specific face recognition problem? To address this problem, we propose a sparse tensor discriminant color space (STDCS) model that represents a color image as a third-order tensor in this paper. The model cannot only keep the underlying spatial structure of color images but also enhance robustness and give intuitionistic or semantic interpretation. STDCS transforms the eigenvalue problem to a series of regression problems. Then one spare color space transformation matrix and two sparse discriminant projection matrices are obtained by applying lasso or elastic net on the regression problems. The experiments on three color face databases, AR, Georgia Tech, and Labeled Faces in the Wild face databases, show that both the performance and the robustness of the proposed method outperform those of the state-of-the-art TDCS model.",2012,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems

Wavelet based hyperspectral image restoration using spatial and spectral penalties,In this paper a penalized least squares cost function with a new spatial-spectral penalty is proposed for hyper- spectral image restoration. The new penalty is a combination of a Group LASSO (GLASSO) and First Order Roughness Penalty (FORP) in the wavelet domain. The restoration criterion is solved using the Alternative Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). The results are compared with other restoration methods where the proposed method outperforms them for the simulated noisy data set based on Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and visually outperforms them on a real degraded data set.,2013,

Upper airways obstruction due to retrosternal goiter in a patient with myasthenia gravis,"Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder of the neuromuscular junction with fluctuating muscle weakness. One of the most frequent and serious symptoms of this disease is the involvement of respiratory muscles [1]. The presence of dyspnea implies a careful management of the patient, in order to avoid respiratory failure [2]. We report the case of a 76-year-old patient who was admitted to our hospital with a 4-month history of mild dysphagia, ptosis, weakness of neck muscles and difficulty in breathing on exertion. She reported progressive fatigue. Symptomatology fluctuating during the day, and worse in the last week. She referred dyspnea especially during the night when maintaining supine position. Her history included hypertensive cardiomyopathy, chronic atrial fibrillation and she was treated with anticoagulants. One son had a positive anamnesis for thyroid disease. Neurological examination revealed ptosis on the right side, orbicularis oculi, and neck muscles weakness. She showed mild proximal upper and lower muscle weakness. Routine blood tests were normal. A provisional diagnosis of myasthenia gravis was made. A test for antibodies against acetylcholine receptors (AchR) was highly positive (44 nmol/l; norm \ 0.25) and repetitive nerve stimulation performed in proximal muscles (trapezius and nasalis) showed a decrement [18%, confirming the diagnosis. Serum TSH, fT3, fT4, and anti-thyroid antibodies were negative. The patient was treated with neostigmine ev and highdose intravenous immunoglobulin infusion, and an immunosuppressive therapy with azatioprine was started. Although she presented a stable improvement of muscle strength, ptosis and dysphagia after a week, she continued to present dyspnea that appeared only in supine position. To asses a disfunction of respiratory muscles, 3 and 5 Hz repetitive stimulation of phrenic nerve [3] were performed, resulted normal. Pulmonary function tests revealed a mild obstruction. Cardiologic assessment documented the absence of heart failure or left ventricular disfunction. CT scans of the chest were negative for anterior mediastinal masses, but revealed a retrosternal intrathoracic multinodular thyroid goiter, resulting in tracheal compression (Fig. 1). The patient initially responded well to conventional treatments, with a good recovery in muscle strength, particularly charged to muscles with bulbar innervation, except for the persistence of orthopnea. Typical presentation of symptoms in our case led to a prompt diagnosis, supported by antibodies testing and neurophysiological studies. The presence of large substernal goiter can cause compression of several mediastinal structures including the trachea and upper airways [4], resulting in progressive respiratory failure. Many studies reported a high prevalence of orthopnea and tidal expiratory flow limitation [5] in patients with non-toxic intrathoracic goiters, and variation in respiratory function depending on postural changes were observed by several authors. Our patient had a rare association between respiratory failure resulting from the myasthenia gravis and retrosternal intrathoracic euthyroid goiter, with tracheal compression.

PW 1593â€…Characteristics and risk factors of physical activity-related injury (PARI) among chinese undergraduate students,"Background University students might be relatively physically active and tend to experience physical activity-related injury (PARI) under the current global campaign to promote physical activity (PA). However, scarce is known about the problem of PARI and its associated factors amongst university students thought it has been firmly appreciated for children and adolescents. Objective This study, supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31640038), aimed to explore the characteristics of PARI and its risk factors among university students in two Chinese cities (namely Shantou, Guangdong and Jinan, Shandong). Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in four universities, where 1421 students Year 1â€“3 were selected randomly and invited to complete the questionnaires during April and May via the one-on-one investigation after their completion of the baseline survey in March and April, 2017. Information of socio-demographics, PA involvement, risk-taking behaviors, and PARI experience in the past 12 months and its related characteristics were collected. The group Lasso and multivariate logistic regression were performed to identify risk factors for PARI. Findings Totally, 486 PARIs were reported by 289 students, with an overall incidence rate of 0.82 injuries/1000 exposure hours of PA participation. Most injuries involved the lower extremities, were newly occurring and medically treated injuries, occurred in outdoor PA (skating, football and basketball particularly) and non-contact situations, with sprain and strain being the major injury types. Over half of the injured (52.1%) experienced an inactivity period of 2 days or above. Significant differences were seen between males and females. PARI was associated with city, gender, study year, club membership, higher vigorous-intensity PA (VPA) volume, and antisocial behaviors. Conclusion and policy implications The above data reinforce the necessary of implementing conditioning and practical programs to underpin the injury mechanism to prevent university students from PARI and maximize the benefits of PA.",2018,Injury Prevention
The effect of miniaturization and galvanic separation of EEG sensor devices in an auditory attention detection task,"Recent technological advances in the design of concealable miniature electroencephalography (mini-EEG) devices are paving the way towards 24/7 neuromonitoring applications in daily life. However, such mini-EEG devices only cover a small area and record EEG over much shorter inter- electrode distances than in traditional EEG headsets. These drawbacks can potentially be compensated for by deploying a multitude of such mini-EEG devices and then jointly processing their recorded EEG signals. In this study, we simulate and investigate the effect of using such multi-node EEG recordings in which the nodes are galvanically separated from each other, and only use their internal electrodes to make short- distance EEG recordings. We focus on a use-case in auditory attention detection (AAD), and we demonstrate that the AAD performance using galvanically separated short-distance EEG measurements is comparable to using an equal number of long- distance EEG measurements if in both cases the electrodes are optimally placed on the scalp. To this end, we use a channel selection method based on a modified version of the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) technique, viz. the group-LASSO, in order to find these optimal locations.",2018,2018 40th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)
Riqualificazione dellâ€™area di MirafÃ¬ori: proposta progettuale per la realizzazione di orti urbani,"Questa tesi di laurea propone un progetto a livello urbano per la riqualificazione di unâ€™area di tipo metropolitano situata nella zona di Mirafiori Sud. Questa porzione di territorio presenta molti nodi critici a livello territoriale urbano: edilizia economica popolare di basso livello, disagi di tipo sociale, strade di scorrimento difficilmente attraversabili, zone con accessi negati, mancanza quasi totale di funzioni di tipo ricreativo. 
Altro elemento caratterizzante e il torrente Sangone con le sue sponde molto degradate, le discariche, e gli orti abusivi. 
Per quanto concerne le caratteristiche climatiche essenziali, la temperatura media annua e di 12,5Â°C mentre le precipitazioni si attestano intorno ai 750 millimetri annui. 
Sotto il profilo urbanistico, il P.R.G.(Piano Regolatore Generale) di Torino individua lâ€™intera area con destinazione a parco (P 29) e caratterizza tutto il territorio interessato come â€œspazi pubblici a parco, per il gioco e lo sportâ€. 
Dopo lo studio di tutta lâ€™area caratterizzata dal percorso del Po, si e individuato un intervento di riqualificazione che ha la propria collocazione all'internoo della Circoscrizione 10 della Citta di Torino e piu precisamente nella parte piu antica del quartiere Mirafiori sud. 
Il suo obiettivo primario e quello di realizzare, attraverso unâ€™approfondita bonifica dei siti, un parco fluviale che colleghi in modo panoramico e qualificato il parco Colonnetti con il parco del Boschetto di Nichelino o Miraflores ed il verde della residenza sabauda di Stupinigi, consentendo di sviluppare lâ€™ipotesi di un allestimento che possa anche dare al Mausoleo della Bela Rosin lâ€™importanza che merita, conferendole una forza attrattiva. Tutte le aree interessate dal presente progetto risultano di proprieta comunale. 
Le aree di progetto ricadono, ai sensi di quanto contenuto nel Piano per lâ€™Assetto Idrogeologico (P.A.I.), prevalentemente in fascia B e in parte in fascia C. 
Trattandosi di interventi in ambito fluviale compresi in parte nella fascia di 150 metri dalle sponde, essi necessitano di autorizzazione ai sensi dell'art.l comma c della legge 431/1985, recepita nel T.U. nÂ°490/99 (Disposizioni legislative in materia di Beni Culturali e Ambientali). Complessivamente la qualita del paesaggio risulta nel complesso scarsa in conseguenza delle condizioni di diffuso degrado e abbandono riscontrabili sullâ€™intera area. 
Purtroppo le citta, oggi, hanno perso molto di quella logica culturale e industriale che anticamente le rendeva indispensabili e addirittura desiderabili. Esse sono ormai quasi soltanto i luoghi dove la maggior parte di noi vive, non avendo piu spazi di liberta e civilta, diventando semplici agglomerati di edifici, centri industriali e di servizi e nel peggiore dei casi, rovine post industriali. 
Alla luce dei fatti appare evidente che cosi come lâ€™uomo ha creato le citta cosi ha cercato di aprirsi una via di fuga da esse. 
Considerato quindi che la maggior parte dei cittadini, spesso, desidererebbe vivere in campagna, (che idealmente rappresenta il luogo dove ritrovare un contatto con la natura, essenziale per il proprio benessere), si puo tentare di definire un percorso in grado di rispondere a questa aspirazione, ma soprattutto di creare citta maggiormente sostenibili. A questo proposito sarebbe necessario rivedere le attuali politiche di pianificazione urbana, rompendo con la tendenza a sviluppare insediamenti compatti (in genere a scapito della presenza di aree verdi) e contro interessi estremamente diversificati e radicati. 
In attesa del cambiamento prospettato e auspicato, si possono tentare altre strade che valorizzino responsabilita e iniziative autonome e sviluppino una trama di spazi verdi fortemente interconnessa col tessuto edilizio, sociale, economico e ambientale. 
Sarebbero quindi indispensabili orti diffusi nell'ottica di migliorare la qualita urbana, per assicurare un futuro di stabilita ed evitare il collasso e soprattutto di ricreare quelle relazioni umane che sono sempre state il fulcro della vita cittadina (la citta e prima di tutto un luogo di relazioni umane). 
Quel che si vuole qui proporre e, percio, solo una riflessione sulle modalita e tecniche di agricoltura urbana, nei loro aspetti pratici e nelle implicazioni specifiche, mostrandone potenzialita e benefici, soprattutto evidenziando come il cambiamento non nasca solo da grandi iniziative e forti istituzioni, ma anche dalle persone, nuovamente responsabili della produzione del proprio cibo e della definizione dei propri spazi, coscienti dell'importanza della sostenibilita di ogni gesto, anche il piu semplice e della condivisione.",2013,
Performance guarantees for sparse regression-based unmixing,"Sparse regression-based unmixing has received much attention in recent years; however, its theoretical performance has not been explored in the literature. In this work, we present theoretical guarantees for the performance of a sparse regression based unmixing (in short, sparse unmixing) implemented in the form of a Lasso optimization with non-negativity constraints. We provide a sufficient condition required for the exact recovery of the endmembers and validate it both theoretically and through experiments. In cases in which the condition is not verified, we explore the performance of sparse unmixing in relation to the exact recovery coefficient (ERC).",2015,2015 7th Workshop on Hyperspectral Image and Signal Processing: Evolution in Remote Sensing (WHISPERS)
"Diet and prey consumption of Antarctic petrels Thalassoica antarctica at Svarthamaren, Dronning Maud Land, and at sea outside the colony","Abstract The diet of the Antarctic petrel Thalassoica antarctica was studied during two seasons at Svarthamaren, an inland colony in Dronning Maud Land, Antarctica, and in the pack ice off the coast of Svarthamaren. The most important food (wet mass) at Svarthamaren was crustaceans (67%), fish (29%) and squid (5%); however, individuals collected in the pack ice took mostly fish (87%). The prey composition and lengths of prey are comparable to what has been documented in other studies on this species. Estimates of food consumption by birds breeding at Svarthamaren (ca. 250,000 pairs) suggest that approximately 6500 tonnes of crustaceans, 2800 tonnes of fish and 435 tonnes of squid are consumed during the breeding season. The annual consumptions of these birds are estimated to be 34,100 tonnes of crustaceans, 14,700 tonnes of fish, and 2300 tonnes of squid. Satellite telemetry data indicate that Antarctic petrels from Svarthamaren may fly more than 3000â€‰km during one foraging trip, and thus may cover a huge ocean area to obtain their prey.",1998,Polar Biology
A Fast Em Algorithm for Quadratic Optimization Subject to Convex Constraints,"Convex constraints (CCs) such as box constraints and linear inequal- ity constraints appear frequently in statistical inference and in applications. The problems of quadratic optimization (QO) subject to CCs occur in isotonic regres- sion, shape-restricted non-parametric regression, variable selection (via the lasso algorithm and bridge regression), limited dependent variables models, image recon- struction, and so on. Existing packages for QO are not generally applicable to CCs. Although EM-type algorithms may be applied to such problems (Tian, Ng and Tan (2005)), the convergence rate/speed of these algorithms is painfully slow, especially for high-dimensional data. This paper develops a fast EM algorithm for QO with CCs. We construct a class of data augmentation schemes indexed by a 'work- ing parameter' r (r 2 R), and then optimize r over R under several convergence criteria. In addition, we use Cholesky decomposition to reduce both the number of latent variables and the dimension, leading to further acceleration of the EM. Standard errors of the restricted estimators are calculated using a non-parametric bootstrapping procedure. Simulation and comparison are performed and a complex multinomial dataset is analyzed to illustrate the proposed methods.",2007,

Controlling the false discoveries in LASSO.,The LASSO method estimates coefficients by minimizing the residual sum of squares plus a penalty term. The regularization parameter Î» in LASSO controls the trade-off between data fitting and sparsity. We derive relationship between Î» and the false discovery proportion (FDP) of LASSO estimator and show how to select Î» so as to achieve a desired FDP. Our estimation is based on the asymptotic distribution of LASSO estimator in the limit of both sample size and dimension going to infinity with fixed ratio. We use a factor analysis model to describe the dependence structure of the design matrix. An efficient majorization-minimization based algorithm is developed to estimate the FDP at fixed value of Î». The analytic results are compared with those of numerical simulations on finite-size systems and are confirmed to be correct. An application to the high-throughput genomic riboavin data set also demonstrates the usefulness of our method.,2017,Biometrics
"2D interpretation of vertical electrical soundings: application to the Sarantaporon basin (Thessaly, Greece)","A large-scale vertical electrical sounding (VES) survey was applied at the basin of Sarantaporon, Elassona in order to study the tectonic and hydrogeological setting of the area. A large number of VES was obtained on a near-regular grid and data were initially processed with 1D inversion algorithm. Since some of the dense measured soundings were collinear, it was possible to combine 1D sounding data and produce 2D data sets which were interpreted using a fully 2D inversion algorithm. 2D geoelectrical models were in very good agreement with the existing drilling information of the area. 2D interpretation results were combined to produce pseudo-3D geoelectrical images of the subsurface. Resulting geoelectrical interpretations are in very good agreement with the existing geological information and reveal a relatively detailed picture of the basin's lithology. Further, the results allowed us to obtain new, and verify existing, structural information regarding the studied area. Overall, it is concluded that 2D interpretation of 1D VES measurements can produce improved subsurface geophysical images and presents a potential useful tool for larger scale geological investigations especially in the case of reprocessing existing VES data sets.",2012,Journal of Geophysics and Engineering
On the conditions used to prove oracle results for the Lasso,"Oracle inequalities and variable selection properties for the Lasso in linear models have been established under a variety of different assumptions on the design matrix. We show in this paper how the different conditions and concepts relate to each other. The restricted eigenvalue condition (Bickel et al., 2009) or the slightly weaker compatibility condition (van de Geer, 2007) are sufficient for oracle results. We argue that both these conditions allow for a fairly general class of design matrices. Hence, optimality of the Lasso for prediction and estimation holds for more general situations than what it appears from coherence (Bunea et al, 2007b,c) or restricted isometry (Candes and Tao, 2005) assumptions.",2009,Electronic Journal of Statistics

Study the influence of temperature on activity of fructosyltransferases by strain Leuconostoc mesenteroides Lm 17,"Correspondence: Veselin Bivolarski Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology, Plovdiv University, 24, Tzar Assen, Str., 4000 Plovdiv, Bulgaria. Tel.:+359 32 261323 e-mail: bivolarski@uni-plovdiv.bg ABSTRACT In the present work we studied the enzyme reaction of extracellular and cellassociated fructosyltransferase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides Lm 17 at different temperatures in order to estimate their influence on the enzyme activity. We measured the enzyme activity at a temperature range from 30Â°C to 45Â°C in the presence of 10% raffinose as a specific substrate for fructosyltransferases (FTFs). The highest extracellular and cell-associated FTF activities were detected at different temperatures â€“ 0,29 U/mg at 30Â°C and 0.72 U/mg at 40Â°C, respectively. We did not detect extracellular FTF activity at 35Â°C. At 45Â°C a strain Lm 17 retained only 10% of the maximum enzyme activity detected at 40Â°C. We found that the studied strain produces mainly cell-associated FTFs which were 71% of the total FTF activity and are more stable at higher temperature. The received results were compared to detected extracellular and cell-associated FTF activities for the referent strain NRRL B-1149. In order to compare the type of produced FTFs from Lm 17 with referent strains Leuconostoc mesenteroides NRRL B-1149, NRRL B-512F and ATCC 8293, which are known as FTF producers, we performed in situ analysis after SDSPAGE of extracellular and cell-associated enzyme fractions. The in situ analysis after Periodic Acid Schiffâ€²s staining procedure showed that all strains produce comparable FTFs with molecular weights corresponding to 120 kDa and 86 kDa.",2012,
[Correction of the Hansen claw hand using direct Zancolli lasso procedures and 2 of its variations].,"The procedure of the Zancolli ""Lasso"" or V direct Zancolli uses a flexor superficialis tendon which after a distal section is turned inside out and is fixed on itself after forming a loop around the proximal pulley of the sheath of the flexor. The mode of distal fixation being the same, the authors also study two different methods which resort either to one tendon for two, three or four fingers, or only to one strip of the flexor tendon for one finger. 45 cases of this kind of operation are reported. In the most important series in which the principle procedure has been used, the results are good in 80% of the mobile claws and average in 70% of the stiffened claws. The cases operated according to the two different methods, less numerous, give approximately the same results. The suggested indications are in favour of the changes in the procedure.",1986,Acta leprologica
AB1005 Multiple Modeling Methods of Administrative Data Yield Consistent Results but Limited Ability To Predict Rheumatoid Arthritis Disease Activity in US Veterans,"Background Epidemiologic research would be significantly enhanced if accurate and reliable methods were available to assess rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease activity using administrative data. The VA rheumatoid arthritis (VARA) registry is a prospective observational cohort that collects RA disease activity including the 28 joint count disease activity score (DAS28) and clinical disease activity index (CDAI). VA administrative data are available and can be employed to develop models to estimate RA disease activity measured by DAS28 and CDAI. Objectives 1. Use administrative data to develop models that predict disease activity. 2. Assess the accuracy of the model under different conditions including defining administrative variables as continuous (CON) and/or categorical (CAT) and stratifying by different disease durations. 3. Describe the accuracy of the models for predicting disease activity for both DAS28 and CDAI. Methods US Veterans with RA enrolled in the VARA registry without cancer, organ transplantation, or other autoimmune diseases were included in the model if they were enrolled in VA with one year of administrative data available before the first DAS28. We identified 1,275 administrative data elements with suspected association with disease activity for prediction modeling. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) was used for variable selection and model development. A series of LASSO models were developed that varied the input variables. Variables were required to have â‰¥1% prevalence in the cohort to be included in model selection. Sub-analysis was also performed in patients with â‰¤2 years and â‰¤5 years of disease duration. Results There were 1,582 US Veterans with RA who fulfilled enrollment criteria. The average age was 62.7Â±11.0 years, 91% male, with a disease duration 13.7Â±12.1 years with 78% and 74% seropositive for rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP antibodies respectively. The adjusted r-square for the six models tested ranged from 0.20â€“0.24 for DAS28 and 0.17 to 0.24 for CDAI. When stratified by disease duration, the r-square associations for patients with and without â‰¤2 and â‰¤5 years of RA duration were 0.29â€“0.31 versus 0.22â€“0.27 for DAS28 and CDAI respectively. Conclusions The multiple models tested yielded very similar results with limited association of predicted disease activity with actual measured disease activity by DAS28 and CDAI in VARA. The use of CON versus CAT variables, multiple definitions for disease activity, and limitation of disease duration to early RA did drastically affect prediction accuracy. Future research should investigate additional strategies to collect components of disease activity measures directly from medical records. Disclosure of Interest G.

The Scale of Sagalassos Red Slip Ware Production - Reconstructions of Local Need and Production Output of Roman Imperial Tableware,"lated during the past decades through archaeological research 1 . The tableware produced here (Sagalassos Red Slip Ware or SRSW), was found on sites both in and around the territory of the ancient town, at a range of inner Anatolian sites, but also as far away as Aquileia (Italy), Carthage (Tunisia), Lepcis Magna (Libya), Hermopolis Magna (Egypt), Hama (Syria) and Tel Anafa (Israel) 2 . The scale and importance of this export of SRSW to these faraway (but also closer) markets are hitherto difficult to define due to a lack of quantified data on ceramic assemblages. Yet, judging from the representation of production infrastructure in the townscape, the scale of the ceramic production at Sagalassos seems substantial for a town of relatively modest size. Therefore, we need to wonder: why did Sagalassos initiate production in Roman Imperial times beyond the Hellenistic local scale; why was it apparently necessary to devote a large area within eastern suburbium to the production of mainly SRSW; and did this production play a significant role for the local economy and thereby contributed to the development of Sagalassos as a monumentalised city? 3 . Previously, the introduction of SRSW production was tentatively linked to wider effects of the founding of a string of official, Augustan coloniae in the wider region, possibly invoking a growth in demand for tableware in the region of Pisidia and/or linked to a pattern of associated regional demographic growth 4 . In the same early Imperial period, new parts could have been added to the territory of Sagalassos, thereby",2015,Adalya
Inferring Time-Delayed Gene Regulatory Networks Using Cross-Correlation and Sparse Regression,"Inferring a time-delayed gene regulatory network from microarray gene-expression is challenging due to the small numbers of time samples and requirements to estimate a large number of parameters. In this paper, we present a two-step approach to tackle this challenge: first, an unbiased cross-correlation is used to determine the probable list of time-delays and then, a penalized regression technique such as the LASSO is used to infer the time-delayed network. This approach is tested on several synthetic and one real dataset. The results indicate the efficacy of the approach with promising future directions.",2013,
Approximate nearest neighbors via dictionary learning,"Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN) in high dimensional vector spaces is a fundamental, yet challenging problem in many areas of computer science, including computer vision, data mining and robotics. In this work, we investigate this problem from the perspective of compressive sensing, especially the dictionary learning aspect. High dimensional feature vectors are seldom seen to be sparse in the feature domain; examples include, but not limited to Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) descriptors, Histogram Of Gradients, Shape Contexts, etc. Compressive sensing advocates that if a given vector has a dense support in a feature space, then there should exist an alternative high dimensional subspace where the features are sparse. This idea is leveraged by dictionary learning techniques through learning an overcomplete projection from the feature space so that the vectors are sparse in the new space. The learned dictionary aids in refining the search for the nearest neighbors to a query feature vector into the most likely subspace combination indexed by its non-zero active basis elements. Since the size of the dictionary is generally very large, distinct feature vectors are most likely to have distinct non-zero basis. Utilizing this observation, we propose a novel representation of the feature vectors as tuples of non-zero dictionary indices, which then reduces the ANN search problem into hashing the tuples to an index table; thereby dramatically improving the speed of the search. A drawback of this naive approach is that it is very sensitive to feature perturbations. This can be due to two possibilities: (i) the feature vectors are corrupted by noise, (ii) the true data vectors undergo perturbations themselves. Existing dictionary learning methods address the first possibility. In this work we investigate the second possibility and approach it from a robust optimization perspective. This boils down to the problem of learning a dictionary robust to feature perturbations, viz. paving the way for a novel Robust Dictionary Learning (RDL) framework. In addition to the above model, we also propose a novel LASSO based multi-regularization hashing algorithm which utilizes the consistency properties of the non-zero active basis for increasing values of the regularization weights. Even though our algorithm is generic and has wide coverage in different areas of scientific computing, the experiments in the current work are mainly focused towards improving the speed and accuracy of ANN for SIFT descriptors, which are high-dimensional (128D) and are one of the most widely used interest point detectors in computer vision. Preliminary results from SIFT datasets show that our algorithm is far superior to the state-of-the-art techniques in ANN.",2011,
Cochlea CT radiomics predicts chemoradiotherapy induced sensorineural hearing loss in head and neck cancer patients: A machine learning and multi-variable modelling study.,"OBJECTIVES
Immediately or after head-and-neck (H&N) cancer chemoradiotherapy (CRT), patients may undergone significant sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) which could affect their quality of life. Radiomic feature analysis is proposed to predict SNHL induced by CRT.


MATERIAL AND METHODS
490 image features of 94 cochlea from 47 patients treated with three dimensional conformal RT (3DCRT) for different H&N cancers were extracted from CT images. Different machine learning (ML) algorithms and also least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) penalized logistic regression were implemented on radiomic features for feature selection, classification and prediction. Also, LASSO penalized logistic model was used for outcome modelling.


RESULTS
The predictive power of ten ML methods was more than 70% (in accuracy, precision and area under the curve of receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)). According to the LASSO penalized logistic modelling, 10 of the 490 radiomic features selected as the associated features with SNHL status. All of the 10 features were statistically associated with SNHL (all of adjusted P-valuesâ€¯<â€¯.001).


CONCLUSION
CT radiomic analysis proposed in this study, could help in the prediction of hearing loss induced by chemoradiation. Our study also, demonstrates that combination of radiomic features with clinical and dosimetric variables can model radiotherapy outcome such as SNHL.",2018,Physica medica : PM : an international journal devoted to the applications of physics to medicine and biology : official journal of the Italian Association of Biomedical Physics
Stopping Rules for Targeted Di usion Index Forecasting,"This paper proposes methods to combine the bene ts of two extant renements to the di usion index forecasting model. We argue that LASSOtype pre-selection of variables for factor estimation, proposed by Bai and Ng (2008), should be more carefully scrutinised as the surviving variables may have undesirable factor model properties such as highly correlated idiosyncratic errors or weak factor in uence. We therefore propose empirical methods drawing upon both Bai and Ng (2008) and Boivin and Ng (2006) to target the factor dataset taking both predictive ability and factor properties into account. We nd our proposed methods work well in forecasting U.S. industrial production over a range of forecast horizons, as well as for a broader set of macroeconomic and nancial series. This con rms the assertion that we should be careful when using LASSO-type pre-selection as the sole targeting method. Another proposed method which allows some discarded variables to enter the model as leading indicators performs well for industrial production but less so over the wider range of series, suggesting that a hybrid DGP with factors and variables is not correct for the majority of series considered. Accounting for a structural break in the factor space in 1984 by running post-break forecasts does not a ect the success of the proposed methods.",2013,

Structure of the substrate complex of thymidine kinase from Ureaplasma urealyticum and investigations of possible drug targets for the enzyme.,"Thymidine kinases have been found in most organisms, from viruses and bacteria to mammals. Ureaplasma urealyticum (parvum), which belongs to the class of cell-wall-lacking Mollicutes, has no de novo synthesis of DNA precursors and therefore has to rely on the salvage pathway. Thus, thymidine kinase (Uu-TK) is the key enzyme in dTTP synthesis. Recently the 3D structure of Uu-TK was determined in a feedback inhibitor complex, demonstrating that a lasso-like loop binds the thymidine moiety of the feedback inhibitor by hydrogen bonding to main-chain atoms. Here the structure with the substrate deoxythymidine is presented. The substrate binds similarly to the deoxythymidine part of the feedback inhibitor, and the lasso-like loop binds the base and deoxyribose moieties as in the complex determined previously. The catalytic base, Glu97, has a different position in the substrate complex from that in the complex with the feedback inhibitor, having moved in closer to the 5'-OH of the substrate to form a hydrogen bond. The phosphorylation of and inhibition by several nucleoside analogues were investigated and are discussed in the light of the substrate binding pocket, in comparison with human TK1. Kinetic differences between Uu-TK and human TK1 were observed that may be explained by structural differences. The tight interaction with the substrate allows minor substitutions at the 3 and 5 positions of the base, only fluorine substitutions at the 2'-Ara position, but larger substitutions at the 3' position of the deoxyribose.",2005,The FEBS journal
Is IR going extinct?,"A global extinction crisis may threaten the survival of most existing life forms. Influential discourses of 'existential risk' suggest that human extinction is a real possibility, while several decades of evidence from conservation biology suggests that the Earth may be entering a 'sixth mass extinction event'. These conditions threaten the possibilities of survival and security that are central to most branches of International Relations. However, this discipline lacks a framework for addressing (mass) extinction. From notions of 'nuclear winter' and 'omnicide' to contemporary discourses on catastrophe, International Relations thinking has treated extinction as a superlative of death. This is a profound category mistake: extinction needs to be understood not in the ontic terms of life and death, but rather in the ontological context of be(com)ing and negation. Drawing on the work of theorists of the 'inhuman' such as Quentin Meillassoux, Claire Colebrook, Ray Brassier, Jean-Francois Lyotard and Nigel Clark, this article provides a pathway for thinking beyond existing horizons of survival and imagines a profound transformation of International Relations. Specifically, it outlines a mode of cosmopolitics that responds to the element of the inhuman and the forces of extinction. Rather than capitulating to narratives of tragedy, this cosmopolitics would make it possible to think beyond the restrictions of existing norms of 'humanity' to embrace an ethics of gratitude and to welcome the possibility of new worlds, even in the face of finitude.",2017,European Journal of International Relations
LASSOing HRI: Analyzing situation awareness in map-centric and video-centric interfaces,"Good situation awareness (SA) is especially necessary when robots and their operators are not collocated, such as in urban search and rescue (USAR). This paper compares how SA is attained in two systems: one that has an emphasis on video and another that has an emphasis on a three-dimensional map. We performed a within-subjects study with eight USAR domain experts. To analyze the utterances made by the participants, we developed a SA analysis technique, called LASSO, which includes five awareness categories: location, activities, surroundings, status, and overall mission. Using our analysis technique, we show that a map-centric interface is more effective in providing good location and status awareness while a video-centric interface is more effective in providing good surroundings and activities awareness.",2007,2007 2nd ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)
A novel cluster HAR-type model for forecasting realized volatility,"This paper proposes a cluster HAR-type model that adopts the hierarchical clustering technique to form the cascade of heterogeneous volatility components. In contrast to the conventional HAR-type models, the proposed cluster models are based on the relevant lagged volatilities selected by the cluster group Lasso. Our simulation evidence suggests that the cluster group Lasso dominates other alternatives in terms of variable screening and that the cluster HAR serves as the top performer in forecasting the future realized volatility. The forecasting superiority of the cluster models are also demonstrated in an empirical application where the highest forecasting accuracy tends to be achieved by separating the jumps from the continuous sample path volatility process.",2019,International Journal of Forecasting
Fast Lasso Algorithm via Selective Coordinate Descent,"For the AI community, the lasso proposed by Tibshirani is an important regression approach in finding explanatory predictors in high dimensional data. The coordinate descent algorithm is a standard approach to solve the lasso which iteratively updates weights of predictors in a round-robin style until convergence. However, it has high computation cost. This paper proposes Sling, a fast approach to the lasso. It achieves high efficiency by skipping unnecessary updates for the predictors whose weight is zero in the iterations. Sling can obtain high prediction accuracy with fewer predictors than the standard approach. Experiments show that Sling can enhance the efficiency and the effectiveness of the lasso.",2016,
The Variable Selection of the Growth Curve Model,"Growth curve model is a general multivariable linear model.It plays an important role in modern statistics.In this paper,firstly,we define the penalized least squares for growth curve model,after transforming it by the Potthoff-Roy transformation.By using adaptive LASSO we can get corresponding estimation,as well as achieve the variable selection.Then,the penalized least squares estimation of the growth curve model is presented with a unified expression of approximate estimation.In addition,we discuss the properties of the penalized least squares estimations of the growth curve model,which is transformed by Potthoff-Roy transformation,and the properties,which are Oracle properties,are proved in this paper.By using the criteria to measure estimation and variable selection,we compare several penalized least squares estimations and the effect of variable selection of different penalty functions.The result shows that the adaptive LASSO performs better in parameter estimation and variable selection.Besides,we compare different transformations.Results indicate that Potthoff-Roy transformation performs better than matrix stacking transformation when considering variable selection and parameter estimation comprehensively.",2014,Chinese Journal of applied probability and statistics

FuDGE: Functional Differential Graph Estimation with fully and discretely observed curves,"We consider the problem of estimating the difference between two functional undirected graphical models with shared structures. In many applications, data are naturally regarded as high-dimensional random function vectors rather than multivariate scalars. For example, electroencephalography (EEG) data are more appropriately treated as functions of time. In these problems, not only can the number of functions measured per sample be large, but each function is itself an infinite dimensional object, making estimation of model parameters challenging. In practice, curves are usually discretely observed, which makes graph structure recovery even more challenging. We formally characterize when two functional graphical models are comparable and propose a method that directly estimates the functional differential graph, which we term FuDGE. FuDGE avoids separate estimation of each graph, which allows for estimation in problems where individual graphs are dense, but their difference is sparse. We show that FuDGE consistently estimates the functional differential graph in a high-dimensional setting for both discretely observed and fully observed function paths. We illustrate finite sample properties of our method through simulation studies. In order to demonstrate the benefits of our method, we propose Joint Functional Graphical Lasso as a competitor, which is a generalization of the Joint Graphical Lasso. Finally, we apply our method to EEG data to uncover differences in functional brain connectivity between alcoholics and control subjects.",2020,ArXiv
Effects of sea hare ink secretion and its escapin-generated components on a variety of predatory fishes.,"Sea hares, Aplysia californica, have a diversity of anti-predatory defenses. One is an actively released chemical defense: an ink secretion that is a mixture of two glandular products--ink from the ink gland and opaline from the opaline gland. The mechanisms of action of ink secretion and its components have recently been examined in detail against several predatory invertebrates. Our goal is to extend this mechanistic analysis to predatory vertebrates. Toward this end, the current study details the effects of ink, opaline, and one set of its components--the products of the reaction of escapin, an l-amino acid oxidase, with its natural substrates, L-lysine and L-arginine--on the palatability of food for five species of fishes: bluehead wrasses Thalassoma bifasciatum, seÃ±orita wrasses Oxyjulis californica, pinfish Lagodon rhomboides, mummichogs Fundulus heteroclitus, and bonnethead sharks Sphyrna tiburo. These fishes have different feeding styles, ranging from large fishes able to engulf sea hares to smaller fishes able to attack sea hares by pecking at them; and they live in a variety of habitats, including those that sea hares typically inhabit. We show that ink but not opaline significantly decreases the palatability of food for all five species, and that escapin products are mildly unpalatable to the two species of wrasses but not to the other species. These results, together with others, show that sea hare ink affects a diversity of predatory fishes, setting the stage for mechanistic studies using electrophysiological analysis of their chemosensory systems.",2010,The Biological bulletin
Forecasting Lake Waikaremoana Water Availability for Hydro Power,"Lake Waikaremoana is a high-altitude, large-volume lake located within the rugged terrain of the Urewera National Park. At the lake outflow a rapid elevation change of nearly 450 metres in 8 kilometres facilitates the lakeâ€™s use as the upper intake portal for the Waikaremoana Hydro Power Scheme. At the time of this study, Genesis Energy operated the Waikaremoana Power Scheme in response to a water availability model based on daily lake level differencing from which daily generation capacity is predicted, allowing strategic bidding into the electricity market. However, when river flows are low this model is subject to error, as small changes in lake level sometimes cannot be determined accurately beyond background noise on daily timescales.

This project develops a method of estimating both current day and day-ahead water availability of Lake Waikaremoana, independent of lake levels using simple hydrological models, thereby improving operational efficiency of the Waikaremoana Power Scheme. The forecasting is developed specifically for the lower inflow conditions when the lake level differencing approach is most error prone.

It has long been recognised that a significant volume of Lake Waikaremoana water leaks through the ancient landslide dam which created the lake. Previous to this study, it was considered that an inaccurate estimation of this leakage rate combined with evaporative losses might contribute to the error within the existing water availability model. A modified catchment water balance and simple regression approach was applied to Lake Waikaremoana to estimate the lake water loss not accounted for by recorded outflows. Estimating this unrecorded loss translates to estimating the intercept of a linear regression relation, where the assumption is made that there is a linear relationship between the discharge of the Aniwaniwa Stream and the net lake water balance (excluding known outflows) under low inflow conditions. On the basis of the confidence intervals about the intercept, the balance term (constant background lake inflow minus leakage and evaporative loss) is estimated to within the range of 2.89 and -1.17 mÂ³s-Â¹ suggesting that the unknown portion of leakage and evaporative losses are not significant contributors to model error. A useful consequence of the regression was that regression coefficients could be used as a means of upscaling to give net lake storage change for low-flow conditions. This enabled day-ahead water availability forecasts to be acquired from Aniwaniwa Stream discharge day-ahead forecasts.

Two forecasting methodologies are developed to forecast the Aniwaniwa Stream discharge: a finite mixture rainfall-runoff model, and a multiple linear regression method. The rainfall-runoff model is formulated initially as a many-parameter model which is then subjected to a lasso-based model simplification concurrent with model calibration. The simplified model forecasts next-day inflows by using a weighted linear combination of hydrograph forms which best match the previous observedâ€¦",2011,
Palynology of Triassicâ€“Jurassic boundary sections in northern Switzerland,"A first palynostratigraphic scheme of Upper Triassic deposits in northern Switzerland was established based on spore-pollen associations and dinoflagellate cyst records from the upper part of the Upper Triassic Klettgau Formation and the lower part of the Lower Jurassic Staffelegg Formation. Drill cores from the Adlerberg region (Basel Tabular Jura) and from Weiach (northern part of Canton Zurich) as well as from an outcrop at the Chilchzimmersattel (Basel Folded Jura) were studied and five informal palynological associations are distinguished. These palynological associations correlate with palynological association of the Central European Epicontinental Basin and the Tethyan realm and provide a stratigraphic framework for the uppermost Triassic sediments in northern Switzerland. Throughout the uppermost Triassic to Jurassic palynological succession a remarkable prominence of Classopollis spp. is observed. Besides Classopollis spp. the three Rhaetian palynological associations A to C from the Upper Triassic Belchen Member include typical Rhaetian spore-pollen and dinoflagellate taxa (e.g., Rhaetipollis germanicus, Geopollis zwolinskae, Rhaetogonyaulax rhaetica, and Dapcodinium priscum). Association B differs from association A in a higher relative abundance of the sporomorph taxa Perinopollenites spp. and the consistent occurrence of Granuloperculatipollis rudis and Ricciisporites tuberculatus. Spore diversity is highest in the late Rhaetian palynological association C and includes Polypodiisporites polymicroforatus. A Rhaetian age for the Belchen Member is confirmed by palynological associations Aâ€“C, but there is no record of the latest Rhaetian and the earliest Jurassic. In contrast to the Rhaetian palynological associations the Early Jurassic associations W and D include Pinuspollenites spp., Trachysporites fuscus (in association W), and Ischyosporites variegatus. In the view of the end-Triassic mass extinction and contemporaneous environmental changes the described palynofloral succession represents the pre-extinction phase (associations A and B) including a distinct transgression, the extinction phase (association C) associated with a regression, and the post-extinction phase (association W).",2017,Swiss Journal of Geosciences
"Metopelloides paguri sp. nov., a new species of symbiotic stenothoid amphipod (Crustacea: Amphipoda: Stenothoidae) associated with sublittoral hermit crabs from the Russian coasts of the Sea of Japan","A new species of amphipod from the genus Metopelloides Gurjanova, 1938 (Crustacea: Amphipoda: Stenothoidae) associated with two species of sublittoral hermit crab species, Pagurus pectinatus (Stimpson, 1858) and Elassochirus cavimanus (Miers, 1879) (Crustacea: Decapoda: Paguridae), is described from the Russian coasts of the Sea of Japan. The new species clearly differs from the congeners by the combination of morphological features such as telson without lateral spines, an elongated mandibular palp with single apical setae, the structures of distoventral palmar margins of subchela on gnathopods I and II in females, bright white-red body coloration. Thus, the record of Metopelloides paguri sp. nov. represents the second record of the family Stenothoidae in the association with sublittoral hermit crabs from the Sea of Japan.",2012,
Pneumococcal-associated purpura fulminans in a healthy infant.,"Purpura fulminans (PF) is characterized by the rapid development of ecchymosis of the skin with symmetrical gangrene of acral zones, fever, and shock, usually together with disseminated intravascular coagulation. The most common cause of PF in children is Neisseria meningitidis sepsis; however, many other infectious etiologies have been reported, including pneumococcal infection. Congenital or acquired immunodeficiencies are associated with invasive pneumococcal infections, being splenic dysfunction the most frequent in the pediatric age. However, pneumococcalassociated PF in an immunocompetent patient is extremely rare. To date, only 4 cases of pneumococcal PF in healthy children have been reported. We describe a new case of PF secondary to pneumococcal sepsis in a healthy 13-monthold infant.",2004,Pediatric emergency care
Data-Driven Construction of Chemical Reaction Network Graph Using Constrained LASSO,"This paper proposes a data-driven method for the automatic construction of chemical reaction network graph. For a given set of chemical species measurements and their (approximate) time derivatives, the proposed method first estimates the nonlinear dynamic model of the reaction using an L1 penalty type sparse identification approach called â€˜constrained least absolute shrinkage and selection operatorâ€™ (Con-strained LASSO). Using the estimated model, a network graph construction approach that takes into account the dynamical constraints (e.g. non-negativity and law of mass action kinetics) of chemical reaction networks is then presented. Simulation result is also presented to illustrate the proposed method.",2019,"2019 6th International Conference on Instrumentation, Control, and Automation (ICA)"
Identifying and Revealing the Importance of Decision-Making Criteria for Health Technology Assessment: A Retrospective Analysis of Reimbursement Recommendations in Ireland,"BackgroundDecisions on reimbursement of health interventions in many jurisdictions are informed by health technology assessments (HTAs). Historically, the focus of these has often been cost effectiveness or cost utility, while other criteria were considered informally. More recently, there has been an increasing interest in the formal incorporation of additional criteria using multi-criteria decision analysis. Such an approach has not yet formally been part of decision-making policy in Ireland.ObjectiveThe objective of this analysis is to demonstrate that cost effectiveness is not the only criterion influencing reimbursement decisions in Ireland. Furthermore, the aim is to reveal criteria that may have informally influenced reimbursement decisions in the past.MethodsA list of potential criteria was identified based on the literature, national guidelines and experience of the national HTA agency. Information on each of these criteria was sought for every assessment conducted in Ireland up to July 2015. A logistic regression was fitted to the data to identify influential parameters. Model selection was performed using the Bolasso method.ResultsThirteen criteria were considered in the analysis. Two members of the HTA review team assessed the performance of the interventions against these criteria. Model selection suggests that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio and quality of evidence could be important drivers of reimbursement recommendations in Ireland. Less important drivers suggested include the year of assessment, the level of uncertainty, as well as safety and tolerability.ConclusionThe analysis demonstrates that recommendations for or against the reimbursement of technologies in Ireland are not only driven by cost effectiveness. This highlights the need for more formal inclusion of criteria in the process, to improve transparency and ensure consistency.",2016,PharmacoEconomics
Time-dependent Poisson reduced rank models for political text data analysis,"Abstract We consider Poisson reduced rank models where parameters depend on time. Our main motivation comes from studies in comparative politics where one wants to locate party positions in a certain political space. For this purpose, several empirical methods have been proposed using text as data sources. As the data structure of texts is very complex, its analysis to extract information is generally a difficult task. Furthermore, political texts usually contain a large number of words such that a simultaneous analysis of word counts becomes challenging. In this paper, we consider Poisson models for each word count simultaneously and provide a statistical method suitable to analyze political text data. We consider a novel model which allows the political lexicon to change over time and develop an estimation procedure based on LASSO and fused LASSO penalization techniques to address high-dimensionality via significant dimension reduction. This model gives insights into the potentially changing use of words by left and right-wing parties over time. The procedure allows to identify automatically those words having a discriminating effect between party positions. To address the dependence structure of word counts over time, we propose integer-valued time series processes to implement a suitable bootstrap method for constructing confidence intervals for the model parameters. We apply our approach to party manifesto data from German parties over seven federal elections after German reunification. The approach does not require any a priori information nor expert knowledge to process the data.",2020,Comput. Stat. Data Anal.

"Early Cretaceous Sporopollen Assemblages from the Shushanhe Formation in Baicheng Area of the Tarim Basin,xinjiang","Forty-eight species of spores and pollen referred to 29 genera have been investigated from the Lower Cretaceous Shushanhe Formation exposed along the Kapushaliang River in Baicheng county,northern Tarim Basin,Xinjiang.In accordance with the constituent peculiarity of spores and pollen in the different beds,the sporopollen assemblage of the Shushanhe Formation may be divided into the following four subassemblages in ascending order:Classopollis-Cycadopites-Lygodioisporites-Biretisporites(CCLB)subassemblage,Classopollis-Dicheiropollis-Schizaeoisporites-Klukisporites(CDSK)subassemblage,Classopollis-Dicheiropollis-Parvisaccites-Lygodiumsporites(CDPL)subassemblage and Classopollis-Dicheiropollis-Pinuspollenites-Impardecispora(CDPI)subassemblage.The palynoflora of the Shushanhe Formation is characterized by the dominance of Cheirolepidiaceae of Coniferales and the influence of Lygodiaceae and Schizaeaceae of Filicales.The present palynoflora is comparable with those of Neocomian assemblages of Europe,Asia,America and Australia.The palynological evidence suggests that the Shushanhe Formation belong to Neocomian or Hauterivian to Barremian in age.",2007,
Variable Selection in Nonparametric Additive Models.,"We consider a nonparametric additive model of a conditional mean function in which the number of variables and additive components may be larger than the sample size but the number of nonzero additive components is ""small"" relative to the sample size. The statistical problem is to determine which additive components are nonzero. The additive components are approximated by truncated series expansions with B-spline bases. With this approximation, the problem of component selection becomes that of selecting the groups of coefficients in the expansion. We apply the adaptive group Lasso to select nonzero components, using the group Lasso to obtain an initial estimator and reduce the dimension of the problem. We give conditions under which the group Lasso selects a model whose number of components is comparable with the underlying model, and the adaptive group Lasso selects the nonzero components correctly with probability approaching one as the sample size increases and achieves the optimal rate of convergence. The results of Monte Carlo experiments show that the adaptive group Lasso procedure works well with samples of moderate size. A data example is used to illustrate the application of the proposed method.",2010,Annals of statistics
On the convergence rate of the bi-alternating direction method of multipliers,"In this paper, we analyze the convergence rate of the bi-alternating direction method of multipliers (BiADMM). Differently from ADMM that optimizes an augmented Lagrangian function, Bi-ADMM optimizes an augmented primal-dual Lagrangian function. The new function involves both the objective functions and their conjugates, thus incorporating more information of the objective functions than the augmented Lagrangian used in ADMM. We show that BiADMM has a convergence rate of O(K-1) (K denotes the number of iterations) for general convex functions. We consider the lasso problem as an example application. Our experimental results show that BiADMM outperforms not only ADMM, but fast-ADMM as well.",2014,"2014 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)"
Environmental influences on patterns of larval replenishment in coral reef fishes,"Spatial and temporal patterns of larval replenishment to the San Blas Archipelago were measured using 3 light traps in each of 3 habitats (exposed, lagoon and back-reef) over 18 lunar months from December 1996 to June 1998. Traps were sampled for 19 consecutive nights centred on the new moon in each month. The effects of environmental variables (wind speed and wind direction, tidal range, rainfall, solar radiation and water temperature) on catches were examined both in the days immediately prior to settlement and during the entire larval phase using 2 approaches. Firstly, time-series analyses were used to compare night-to-night patterns in light trap catches of 11 species (Astrapogon puncticulatus, Eucinostomus melanopterus, Lutjanus apodus, L. mahogani, Ophioblen- nius atlanticus, Stegastes dorsopunicans, S. partitus, S. planifrons Synodontidae spp., Thalassoma bifasciatum and an unidentified blenny) with environmental variables. Secondly, modified correla- tion analysis was used to examine the relationships between environmental variables, averaged over larval durations, and light trap catches of 6 of these species. Time-series analysis detected significant correlations between catches of 8 species and wind direction; however, correlations were often weak and variable in direction. Similarly, there were weak correlations between day-to-day catches of all but 3 species and water temperature. Modified correlation analysis also found that water temperature was correlated with catches of 4 species (Lutjanus mahogani, Stegastes dorsopunicans, S. partitus and S. planifrons). Catches of the remaining species, Ophioblennius atlanticus and Thalassoma bifas- ciatum, were not correlated with environmental variables in these analyses. Multiple-regression analysis could not detect any combined effects of environmental variables on patterns of light trap catches, although this analysis also identified weak correlations (R 2 = 0.08 to 0.29) between catches of Lutjanus mahogani, Ophioblennius atlanticus, Stegastes dorsopunicans, S. partitus, S. planifrons and Thalassoma bifasciatum and water temperature.",2001,Marine Ecology Progress Series
An extended-Lagrangian scheme for charge equilibration in reactive molecular dynamics simulations,"Abstract Reactive molecular dynamics (RMD) simulations describe chemical reactions at orders-of-magnitude faster computing speed compared with quantum molecular dynamics (QMD) simulations. A major computational bottleneck of RMD is charge-equilibration (QEq) calculation to describe charge transfer between atoms. Here, we eliminate the speed-limiting iterative minimization of the Coulombic energy in QEq calculation by adapting an extended-Lagrangian scheme that was recently proposed in the context of QMD simulations, Souvatzis and Niklasson (2014). The resulting XRMD simulation code drastically improves energy conservation compared with our previous RMD code, Nomura etÂ al. (2008), while substantially reducing the time-to-solution. The XRMD code has been implemented on parallel computers based on spatial decomposition, achieving a weak-scaling parallel efficiency of 0.977 on 786,432 IBM Blue Gene/Q cores for a 67.6 billion-atom system.",2015,Comput.

A Comparison of Various Data Reduction Procedures in a Multiple Sclerosis Sleep Study,"Clinical studies often deal with datasets with numerous variables. As a result of the similarities between the variables, we frequently observe the presence of multicollinearity in the data. This study aimed to apply different data reduction strategies to sleep study variables in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. The main objective was to use various data reduction strategies to explain a subjective measure of sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index: PSQI) by the objective measures of sleep quality obtained during complete in-laboratory overnight polysomnography. Overall, we found that few objective measures of sleep quality were important in explaining the subjective PSQI, based on the results of various well-accepted statistical methods. Total sleep time was found to be the most important feature of objective sleep quality for explaining subjective sleep quality among all other investigated objective sleep quality variables in most of the approaches investigated in this study. The LASSO method for estimation worked best in terms of interpretability among all the approaches considered.",2018,
The Logistic Lasso and Ridge Regression in Predicting Corporate Failure,"Abstract The prediction of corporate bankruptcy is a phenomenon of interest to investors, creditors, borrowing firms, and governments alike. Many quantitative methods and distinct variable selection techniques have been employed to develop empirical models for predicting corporate bankruptcy. For the present study the lasso and ridge approaches were undertaken, since they deal well with multicolinearity and display the ideal properties to minimize the numerical instability that may occur due to overfitting. The models were employed to a dataset of 2032 non-bankrupt firms and 401 bankrupt firms belonging to the hospitality industry, over the period 2010-2012. The results showed that the lasso and ridge models tend to favor the category of the dependent variable that appears with heavier weight in the training set, when compared to the stepwise methods implemented in SPSS.",2016,Procedia.

How to review a manuscript.,"1. IntroductionThedecisiontorejectoracceptamanuscriptisforanim-portantpartbasedonpeerreview.Theprocessofpeerreview,asweknowit,wasintroducedonlyinthe20thcentury.Jour-nals such as Science and Journal of the American MedicalAssociation(JAMA)didnotuseexternalreviewersuntilafter1940. Before that time, there was more journal space thanarticles to print, and the primary task of the assistant editorswas to elicit articles to ï¬ll the journals. With increasing sci-entiï¬c specialization, and a larger number of scientists, out-side assistance in selecting manuscripts for publicationbecame necessary. The invention of the typewriter and thephotocopier facilitated this process because it allowed thereplication of submitted manuscripts [1,2].Good reviews not only aid in the selection of manu-scripts for publication but also improve the clarity, transpar-ency, accuracy, and utility of the selected submissions.Reviewers who write poor quality reviews are often not in-vited again, and some journals even score the quality ofeach review [3]. The assumption underlying all this is thatthe peer review process improves the quality of publishedarticles. There have been surprisingly few studies examin-ing the effectiveness of peer review, partly because of thefact that it is such an integral part of the complex scientiï¬cprocess. However, the limited evidence available indeedsuggests that peer review may lead to higher methodologi-cal and reporting quality of published articles as is shownby a systematic review of Jefferson et al. [4]. This reviewshowed that peer-reviewed articles were of higher method-ological and reporting quality than nonpeer-reviewed arti-cles in a cohort study comparing 394 articles published inhigh-ranking peer-reviewed journals compared with high-circulation throwaway journals. Peer review and editingalso made articles more readable and improved the generalquality of reporting, as shown by two studies comparing thequality of manuscripts before and after reviewing. Further-more, adding a statistical/methodological reviewer improvedthe quality of ï¬nal manuscripts in a small, double-blind,randomized, controlled trial.Once researchers develop expertise in a certain researcharea, they will be asked to review manuscripts. Being ableto give clever and constructive comments is illustrative forthe capacity of researchers, and funding organizations andeditors will ask the opinions that are worth asking. Thequality of the review is also an important aspect in the se-lection of new members for editorial boards. But what isa high-quality review? Is research a matter of â€˜â€˜see one,do one, judge one?â€™â€™ How much time should a reviewerspendonareview?Arethereanyspeciï¬celementsthatare-view should include? Often, there is not enough time to dis-cuss reviews among colleagues. Furthermore, journalsusually do not give feedback; they just do not invite thereviewer again if the review is poor.Most journals have instructions for reviewers. These in-structions, also mentioned in the guideline for editors of theWorld Association of Medical Editors, usually mention thetopics that the review should cover, such as originality ofthe research, the design of the study, presentation of theresults, and so forth. These checklists give the revieweran idea of the topics, and these topics obviously shouldbe in the review. However, these guidelines do not makethe distinction between a good and a bad review. Writinga good review also involves understanding and appreciatingthe editorial process, structuring the review in a comprehen-sive way, and being aware of some general but often un-written rules.In this tutorial, wewill present a guideline that reviewerscan use when reviewing a manuscript. This guideline wasdeveloped with the use of existing literature on this topic[5e7]. In addition, the authors of this article give lecturesand a course on â€˜â€˜how to review a manuscript.â€™â€™ Duringthese sessions, the dynamic discussions were used to im-prove the list of â€˜â€˜dos and donâ€™ts.â€™â€™ We suggest using thescheme as shown in Table 1 when reviewing a manuscript.We will follow the outline of this scheme in this article.",2010,Journal of clinical epidemiology
Study of ancient mortars from Sagalassos (Turkey) in view of their conservation,"Abstract Since 1990, regular archeological excavations are done in the Roman city of Sagalassos (southwestern Turkey) by the Catholic University of Leuven (Belgium). The mineralogy and petrography of the lime mortars at Sagalassos have been studied in detail as part of an investigation of the provenance of mineral raw materials present in the territory of Sagalassos. The samples were analysed with optical microscopy on thin sections followed by XRD analyses to design a suitable repair mortar. The lime used as binder was burnt from local Triassic limestones and prepared by dry slaking. Three main types of aggregates have been identified: limestone from local Mesozoic limestones, crushed ceramics from locally produced coarse wares and volcanic tuff from a nearby volcanic region. To preserve the excavated remains in very harsh climatic winter conditions, experimental mixtures of restoration mortar have been tested for strength and frost resistance using similar raw materials as in ancient times. The proposed mortar for further on-site conservation and restoration consists of a mix of lime with crushed volcanic rock from the region of Isparta. This composition is very similar to the original Roman material and shows a high frost resistance in freezeâ€“thaw testing.",2002,Cement and Concrete Research
"A Sharp Error Analysis for the Fused Lasso, with Application to Approximate Changepoint Screening","In the 1-dimensional multiple changepoint detection problem, we derive a new fast error rate for the fused lasso estimator, under the assumption that the mean vector has a sparse number of changepoints. This rate is seen to be suboptimal (compared to the minimax rate) by only a factor of $\log\log{n}$. Our proof technique is centered around a novel construction that we call a lower interpolant. We extend our results to misspecified models and exponential family distributions. We also describe the implications of our error analysis for the approximate screening of changepoints.",2017,
Some Sparse Methods for High Dimensional Data,"High dimensional data means that the number of variables p is far larger than the number of observations n . This occurs in several fields such as genomic data or chemometrics. When p>n the OLS estimator does not exist for linear regression. Since it is a case of forced multicollinearity, one may use regularized methods such as ridge regression, principal component regression or PLS regression: these methods provide rather robust estimates through a dimension reduction approach or constraints on the regression coefficients. The fact that all the predictors are kept may be considered as a positive point in some cases. However if p>>n, it becomes a drawback since a combination of thousands of variables cannot be interpreted. Sparse combinations, ie with a large number of zero coefficients are preferred. Lasso, elastic net, sPLS perform simultaneously regularization and variable selection thanks to non quadratic penalties: L1, SCAD etc. Group-lasso is a generalization fitted to the case where explanatory variables are structured in blocks. Recent works include sparse discriminant analysis and sparse canonical correlation analysis. In PCA, the singular value decomposition shows that if we regress principal components onto the input variables, the vector of regression coefficients is equal to the factor loadings. It suffices to adapt sparse regression techniques to get sparse versions of PCA. Sparse Multiple Correspondence Analysis is derived from group-lasso with groups of indicator variables. Finally when one has a large number of observations, it is frequent that unobserved heterogeneity occurs, which means that there is no single model, but several local models: one for each cluster of a latent variable. Clusterwise methods optimize simultaneously the partition and the local models; they have been already extended to PLS regression. We will present here CS-PLS (Clusterwise Sparse PLS) a combination of clusterwise PLS and sPLS which is well fitted for big data: large n , large p.",2016,
A Framework for Global Characterization of Soil Properties Using Repeat Hyperspectral Satellite Data,"Imaging spectroscopy offers the potential to quantify the soil properties over large areas based on its reflectance spectra. Soils are heterogeneous mixtures of minerals, air, water, and organic matter leading to complex manifestations of reflectance in the different parts of the visible-shortwave infrared spectra. Due to this complexity, data-driven modeling approaches are found to be most suitable for characterizing the relationships between soil spectra and the corresponding soil properties. Proposed spaceborne hyperspectral missions, such as Hyperspectral Infrared Imager, offer the possibility of repeating global spectral measurements in a 16- to 20-day revisit period. Soil attributes on the landscape vary at different rates. In particular, the soil textural attributes (percentage of sand, silt, and clay) may be assumed to remain invariant compared to chemical constituents during multiple consecutive 16- to 20-day satellite revisit period. We present a theoretical retrieval framework for assimilating repeat spaceborne soil spectral measurements into a previously developed lasso algorithm-based ensemble modeling framework for the global-scale characterization of soil textural attributes. The repeat spectral assimilation with each overpass of the satellite leads to the development of an enriched â€œdynamic soil spectral libraryâ€ which spatially propagates the improvement in the characterization of soil textural properties globally, given the uncertain variations in other auxiliary factors, such as moisture and organic matter, affecting soil reflectance.",2019,IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing
Clinical prediction of thrombectomy eligibility: A systematic review and 4-item decision tree,"Background A clinical large anterior vessel occlusion (LAVO)-prediction scale could reduce treatment delays by allocating intra-arterial thrombectomy (IAT)-eligible patients directly to a comprehensive stroke center. Aim To subtract, validate and compare existing LAVO-prediction scales, and develop a straightforward decision support tool to assess IAT-eligibility. Methods We performed a systematic literature search to identify LAVO-prediction scales. Performance was compared in a prospective, multicenter validation cohort of the Dutch acute Stroke study (DUST) by calculating area under the receiver operating curves (AUROC). With group lasso regression analysis, we constructed a prediction model, incorporating patient characteristics next to National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) items. Finally, we developed a decision tree algorithm based on dichotomized NIHSS items. Results We identified seven LAVO-prediction scales. From DUST, 1316 patients (35.8% LAVO-rate) from 14 centers were available for validation. FAST-ED and RACE had the highest AUROC (both >0.81, pâ€‰<â€‰0.01 for comparison with other scales). Group lasso analysis revealed a LAVO-prediction model containing seven NIHSS items (AUROC 0.84). With the GACE (Gaze, facial Asymmetry, level of Consciousness, Extinction/inattention) decision tree, LAVO is predicted (AUROC 0.76) for 61% of patients with assessment of only two dichotomized NIHSS items, and for all patients with four items. Conclusion External validation of seven LAVO-prediction scales showed AUROCs between 0.75 and 0.83. Most scales, however, appear too complex for Emergency Medical Services use with prehospital validation generally lacking. GACE is the first LAVO-prediction scale using a simple decision tree as such increasing feasibility, while maintaining high accuracy. Prehospital prospective validation is planned.",2018,International Journal of Stroke
Inference on average treatment effects in aggregate panel data settings,"This paper studies inference on treatment effects in aggregate panel data settings with a single treated unit and many control units. We propose new methods for making inference on average treatment effects in settings where both the number of pre-treatment and the number of post-treatment periods are large. We use linear models to approximate the counterfactual mean outcomes in the absence of the treatment. The counterfactuals are estimated using constrained Lasso, an essentially tuning free regression approach that nests difference-in-differences and synthetic control as special cases. We propose a $K$-fold cross-fitting procedure to remove the bias induced by regularization. To avoid the estimation of the long run variance, we construct a self-normalized $t$-statistic. The test statistic has an asymptotically pivotal distribution (a student $t$-distribution with $K-1$ degrees of freedom), which makes our procedure very easy to implement. Our approach has several theoretical advantages. First, it does not rely on any sparsity assumptions. Second, it is fully robust against misspecification of the linear model. Third, it is more efficient than difference-in-means and difference-in-differences estimators. The proposed method demonstrates an excellent performance in simulation experiments, and is taken to a data application, where we re-evaluate the economic consequences of terrorism.",2019,
Structured sparse logistic regression with application to lung cancer prediction using breath volatile biomarkers.,"This article is motivated by a study of lung cancer prediction using breath volatile organic compound (VOC) biomarkers, where the challenge is that the predictors include not only high-dimensional time-dependent or functional VOC features but also the time-independent clinical variables. We consider a high-dimensional logistic regression and propose two different penalties: group spline-penalty or group smooth-penalty to handle the group structures of the time-dependent variables in the model. The new methods have the advantage for the situation where the model coefficients are sparse but change smoothly within the group, compared with other existing methods such as the group lasso and the group bridge approaches. Our methods are easy to implement since they can be turned into a group minimax concave penalty problem after certain transformations. We show that our fitting algorithm possesses the descent property and leads to attractive convergence properties. The simulation studies and the lung cancer application are performed to demonstrate the accuracy and stability of the proposed approaches.",2019,Statistics in medicine
Correlates of Adjuvant Therapy Attitudes in African American Breast Cancer Patients.,"PURPOSE
Black breast cancer patients delay and underutilize adjuvant breast cancer therapies; yet, very few studies have specifically examined Black women's attitudes toward breast cancer therapy. This study observed the influence of self-reported interpersonal processes of care (e.g. self-efficacy) clinical and sociodemographic factors and sociocultural (e.g. religiosity), related to Black breast cancer patients' attitudes toward radiation and systemic therapies (chemotherapy and adjuvant endocrine therapy - ""AET"").


METHODS
This was a secondary analysis of data from the Narrowing Gaps in Adjuvant Therapy Study (2006-2011). The analysis included 210 Black women who were newly diagnosed with breast cancer. Bivariate and multiple regression analyses were performed between independent variables (e.g., demographics) and three outcome variables (chemotherapy, AET, and radiation therapy) to asses women's perceptions of therapy type. The lasso method was used to select variables correlated with therapy attitudes.


RESULTS
Most women reported negative attitudes toward AET (56%) and radiation (54%); fewer negative attitudes were observed toward chemotherapy (47%). Higher education and greater perceived susceptibility of a recurrence were associated with more positive attitudes toward chemotherapy. Regarding radiation therapy, women with greater patient satisfaction were more likely to have more positive attitudes.


CONCLUSIONS
Our study findings may aid in the development of behavioral interventions targeted to mitigate Black women breast cancer treatment disparities. We found modifiable factors (e.g. communication, satisfaction ratings) that support opportunities for clinicians to better address Black women's needs regarding adjuvant treatment options.

Catheter simulator software tool to generate electrograms of any multi-polar diagnostic catheter from 3D atrial tissue,"Simulations are excellent tools for assessing new therapeutic strategies and are often conducted before implementing new therapy options in a clinical practice. For patients suffering from a heart arrhythmia, the main source of information comes from an intracardiac catheter. One of the common catheters is a Lasso multi-pole diagnostic catheter, which is a catheter that has 20 electrodes in a circular pattern. In this paper, we developed algorithm and simulation software that allows the users to place a multi-pole catheter on the atrial endocardial surface and record electrograms. In 3D atrial tissue, the plane of principal curvature is determined using eigenvectors of catheter vertices, from where the normals are projected and registered to the surface using 3D geodesic distance. This tool provides a platform for performing customized virtual cardiac experiments.",2016,2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)
The degrees of freedom of the Group Lasso for a General Design,"In this paper, we are concerned with regression problems where covariates can be grouped in nonoverlapping blocks, and where only a few of them are assumed to be active. In such a situation, the group Lasso is an at- tractive method for variable selection since it promotes sparsity of the groups. We study the sensitivity of any group Lasso solution to the observations and provide its precise local parameterization. When the noise is Gaussian, this allows us to derive an unbiased estimator of the degrees of freedom of the group Lasso. This result holds true for any fixed design, no matter whether it is under- or overdetermined. With these results at hand, various model selec- tion criteria, such as the Stein Unbiased Risk Estimator (SURE), are readily available which can provide an objectively guided choice of the optimal group Lasso fit.",2012,ArXiv
A Novel Combinatorial Method for Estimating Transcript Expression with RNA-Seq: Bounding the Number of Paths,"RNA-Seq technology offers new high-throughput ways for transcript identification and quantification based on short reads, and has recently attracted great interest. The problem is usually modeled by a weighted splicing graph whose nodes stand for exons and whose edges stand for split alignments to the exons. The task consists of finding a number of paths, together with their expression levels, which optimally explain the coverages of the graph under various fitness functions, such least sum of squares. In (Tomescu et al. RECOMB-seq 2013) we showed that under general fitness functions, if we allow a polynomially bounded number of paths in an optimal solution, this problem can be solved in polynomial time by a reduction to a min-cost flow program. In this paper we further refine this problem by asking for a bounded number k of paths that optimally explain the splicing graph. This problem becomes NP-hard in the strong sense, but we give a fast combinatorial algorithm based on dynamic programming for it. In order to obtain a practical tool, we implement three optimizations and heuristics, which achieve better performance on real data, and similar or better performance on simulated data, than state-of-the-art tools Cufflinks, IsoLasso and SLIDE. Our tool, called Traph, is available at http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/gsa/traph/ .",2013,
Variable selection via nonconcave penalty function in structure-boiling points correlations,"A new variable selection approach based on nonconcave penalized least squares is employed for interpretation and prediction of boiling points (bps) of 530 alkanes. The good performances of the proposed method, compared with stepwise regression and the improved least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), along with its simplicity and fast speed, makes it a valid competitor to the existing variable selection methods. All the 530 saturated hydrocarbons with carbon numbers from 2 to 10 and 128 common topological indices are taken into account. As a result, only 12 topological indices (TIs) are selected from 95 pretreated ones but they still present a satisfying fitting and prediction effects.",2005,Journal of Molecular Structure-theochem

Effect of bamboo vinegar powder as an antibiotic alternative on the digesta bacteria communities of finishing pigs.,"This study investigated the use for bamboo vinegar powder as an antibiotic alternative in the diet of growing-finishing pigs by examining their digestive bacterial communities. Forty-five Duroc Ã— Landrace Ã— Yorkshire growing-finishing pigs were randomly allocated to five diet groups: 0%, 0.5%, 1.0%, or 1.5% bamboo vinegar levels and antibiotics. After 37 days, the digesta in duodenum of four pigs from each treatment were analyzed for their bacterial community compositions using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The addition of 1.5% bamboo vinegar powder had an effect on the intestinal microflora most similar to that of antibiotics, indicating its potential to promote the growth and development of finishing pigs. We also found the 1.5% bamboo vinegar powder group to have an increased abundance of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes compared with the other bamboo vinegar powder groups, which may enhance the ability of the host to absorb food energy and store more body fat. Additionally, the effects of bamboo vinegar powder on promoting the abundances of Lactobacillus and Thalassospira and on inhibiting Streptococcus and Prevotella growth revealed it may play an important role in animal production. Moreover, functional predictions of microbes via PICRUSt indicated that feed supplemented with 1.5% bamboo vinegar powder could promote many vital metabolic pathways.",2018,Canadian journal of microbiology
[Apparatus LPK-25 for esophago-intestinal anastomoses in gastrectomy and proximal resection of stomach].,"New method for performance of compression esophago-intestinal lasso-anastomosis is proposed. Th main point of the anastomosis consists in pressing of bowel walls to esophageal walls at small cuff by latex ring fixed by special apparatus LPK-25 introduced into the lumen of the bowel through additional incision which is anastomosed with the esophagus. Stretched latex ring creates elastic squeesing of tissues on caval cuff and stops blood flow. Cranially to the zone of compression accretion of esophageal walls with the bowel occurs, and caudally to this zone necrosis has appeared, which resulted in rejection of all compressing construction.

Predicting Suicide Attempts and Suicide Deaths Following Outpatient Visits Using Electronic Health Records.,"OBJECTIVE:
The authors sought to develop and validate models using electronic health records to predict suicide attempt and suicide death following an outpatient visit.


METHOD:
Across seven health systems, 2,960,929 patients age 13 or older (mean age, 46 years; 62% female) made 10,275,853 specialty mental health visits and 9,685,206 primary care visits with mental health diagnoses between Jan. 1, 2009, and June 30, 2015. Health system records and state death certificate data identified suicide attempts (N=24,133) and suicide deaths (N=1,240) over 90 days following each visit. Potential predictors included 313 demographic and clinical characteristics extracted from records for up to 5 years before each visit: prior suicide attempts, mental health and substance use diagnoses, medical diagnoses, psychiatric medications dispensed, inpatient or emergency department care, and routinely administered depression questionnaires. Logistic regression models predicting suicide attempt and death were developed using penalized LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) variable selection in a random sample of 65% of the visits and validated in the remaining 35%.


RESULTS:
Mental health specialty visits with risk scores in the top 5% accounted for 43% of subsequent suicide attempts and 48% of suicide deaths. Of patients scoring in the top 5%, 5.4% attempted suicide and 0.26% died by suicide within 90 days. C-statistics (equivalent to area under the curve) for prediction of suicide attempt and suicide death were 0.851 (95% CI=0.848, 0.853) and 0.861 (95% CI=0.848, 0.875), respectively. Primary care visits with scores in the top 5% accounted for 48% of subsequent suicide attempts and 43% of suicide deaths. C-statistics for prediction of suicide attempt and suicide death were 0.853 (95% CI=0.849, 0.857) and 0.833 (95% CI=0.813, 0.853), respectively.


CONCLUSIONS:
Prediction models incorporating both health record data and responses to self-report questionnaires substantially outperform existing suicide risk prediction tools.",2018,The American journal of psychiatry
Bayesian projection approaches to variable selection in generalized linear models,"A Bayesian approach to variable selection which is based on the expected Kullback-Leibler divergence between the full model and its projection onto a submodel has recently been suggested in the literature. For generalized linear models an extension of this idea is proposed by considering projections onto subspaces defined via some form of L""1 constraint on the parameter in the full model. This leads to Bayesian model selection approaches related to the lasso. In the posterior distribution of the projection there is positive probability that some components are exactly zero and the posterior distribution on the model space induced by the projection allows exploration of model uncertainty. Use of the approach in structured variable selection problems such as ANOVA models is also considered, where it is desired to incorporate main effects in the presence of interactions. Projections related to the non-negative garotte are able to respect the hierarchical constraints. A consistency result is given concerning the posterior distribution on the model induced by the projection, showing that for some projections related to the adaptive lasso and non-negative garotte the posterior distribution concentrates on the true model asymptotically.",2010,Comput.

Quantile regression: a penalization approach,"Sparse group LASSO (SGL) is a penalization technique used in regression problems where the covariates have a natural grouped structure and provides solutions that are both between and within group sparse. In this paper the SGL is introduced to the quantile regression (QR) framework, and a more flexible version, the adaptive sparse group LASSO (ASGL), is proposed. This proposal adds weights to the penalization improving prediction accuracy. Usually, adaptive weights are taken as a function of the original non-penalized solution model. This approach is only feasible in the n > p framework. In this work, a solution that allows using adaptive weights in high-dimensional scenarios is proposed. The benefits of this proposal are studied both in synthetic and real datasets.",2019,arXiv: Methodology
$\ell_1$-Penalized censored Gaussian graphical model.,"Graphical lasso is one of the most used estimators for inferring genetic networks. Despite its diffusion, there are several fields in applied research where the limits of detection of modern measurement technologies make the use of this estimator theoretically unfounded, even when the assumption of a multivariate Gaussian distribution is satisfied. Typical examples are data generated by polymerase chain reactions and flow cytometer. The combination of censoring and high-dimensionality make inference of the underlying genetic networks from these data very challenging. In this article, we propose an $\ell_1$-penalized Gaussian graphical model for censored data and derive two EM-like algorithms for inference. We evaluate the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms by an extensive simulation study and show that, when censored data are available, our proposal is superior to existing competitors both in terms of network recovery and parameter estimation. We apply the proposed method to gene expression data generated by microfluidic Reverse Transcription quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction technology in order to make inference on the regulatory mechanisms of blood development.

Variation saisonniÃ¨re des populations prÃ©-imaginales de la cÃ©cidomyie africaine du riz Orseolia oryzivora et de ses dÃ©gÃ¢ts en fonction des plantes hÃ´tes dans le sud-ouest du Burkina Faso,"The African rice gall midge Orseolia oryzivora is a major pest of rice in Burkina Faso. The present study was carried out during four consecutive crop seasons from 1999 to 2001, in three rice-irrigated schemes, near Bobo Dioulasso town in south Burkina Faso. The fluctuation of immature stages of the pest and their damage, with regard to host plants was monitored. These included the cultivated rice Oryza sativa and its ratoons, and wild rice Oryza longistaminata. Sampling on growing rice was carried out monthly in 1 m2 quadrats, in each of 100 randomly selected farmers fields. Sampling on rice ratoons was carried out after rice harvest and 500 tillers were randomly selected in the same fields and taken to the laboratory for dissection. Data on wild rice were collected every month by sampling and dissecting 500 tillers per site. This study revealed that in the absence of rice, the pest survived on rice ratoons and wild rice. However, cultivated rice was the preferred host plant as the crop recorded over 15% galling during wet seasons while damage was very low in dry seasons. Results from this study represent an important step towards the development of an IPM programme to control the rice gall midge, with regard to its host plant relationships.RÃ©sumÃ©La cÃ©cidomyie africaine du riz Orseolia oryzivora est un important ravageur du riz au Burkina Faso.

Prediction of anastomotic leakage after anterior rectal resection,"Objective
Anastomotic Leakage (AL) is one of the most common complications after resection of rectal cancer. Recognition of the incidence and risk factors related to AL is important. This study aimed develops a model that can predict anastomotic leakage after anterior rectal resection.


Methods
Data from 188 patients undergoing anterior resection of rectal cancer were collected for retrospective analysis. Patients were randomly divided in the development set and validation set at a 1:1 ratio. We first included age, sex, preoperative chemoradiotherapy, tumor size, degree of tumor differentiation, stage, TNM stage, lymph vascular invasion, distance, anastomotic method, diabetes, intraoperative time, intraoperative bleeding and smoking as candidates for variable selection with a LASSO method. A ROC curve was constructed with the validation set to assess the accuracy of the prediction model.


Results
AL occurred in 20 of 188 patients (10.6%). Preoperative chemoradiotherapy (p=0.04), medium degree of tumor differentiation (p=0.04), anastomotic method (p<0.01), intraoperative bleedingâ‰¥400ml (p<0.01), smoking (p<0.01), diabetes (p<0.01) were significantly related to AL. The area under the ROC curve of the prediction model is 0.952.


Conclusions

Variable selection for k means quantization,"Recent results in quantization theory provide theoretical bounds on the distortion of squared-norm based quantizers. These bounds are valid whenever the source distribution has a bounded support, regardless of the dimension of the underlying Hilbertian space. However, it remains of interest to select relevant variable for quantization. This task is usually performed using coordinate energy-ratio thresholding , or maximizing a constrained empirical Between Cluster Sum of Squares criterion. This paper offers a Lasso type procedure to select the relevant variables for $k$-means clustering. Moreover, some non-asymptotic convergence results on the distortion are derived for this procedure, along with consistency results toward sparse codebooks.",2014,arXiv: Statistics Theory

Lasso procedure to correct finger-clawing in leprosy using index or middle finger flexor digitorum superficialis split into four tails--a long-term follow-up study.,"For obvious reasons, the use of flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) from the ring finger, for correction of finger-clawing, is usually not recommended in leprosy. Hence, one has to choose either index or middle finger FDS for correction of finger-clawing. No significant differences could be made out when follow-up data of claw-finger correction by modified lasso procedure, using FDS either from index or middle finger, were compared. In some hands post-operative problems, such as stiffness, superficialis minus deformities of proximal interphalangeal joints (PIPJ) and distal interphalangeal joints (DIPJ), were noted.

Genomic prediction of breeding values for carcass traits in Nellore cattle,"BackgroundThe objective of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of genomic predictions for rib eye area (REA), backfat thickness (BFT), and hot carcass weight (HCW) in Nellore beef cattle from Brazilian commercial herds using different prediction models.MethodsPhenotypic data from 1756 Nellore steers from ten commercial herds in Brazil were used. Animals were offspring of 294 sires and 1546 dams, reared on pasture, feedlot finished, and slaughtered at approximately 2Â years of age. All animals were genotyped using a 777k Illumina Bovine HD SNP chip. Accuracy of genomic predictions of breeding values was evaluated by using a 5-fold cross-validation scheme and considering three models: Bayesian ridge regression (BRR), Bayes C (BC) and Bayesian Lasso (BL), and two types of response variables: traditional estimated breeding value (EBV), and phenotype adjusted for fixed effects (Y*).ResultsThe prediction accuracies achieved with the BRR model were equal to 0.25 (BFT), 0.33 (HCW) and 0.36 (REA) when EBV was used as response variable, and 0.21 (BFT), 0.37 (HCW) and 0.46 (REA) when using Y*. Results obtained with the BC and BL models were similar. Accuracies increased for traits with a higher heritability, and using Y* instead of EBV as response variable resulted in higher accuracy when heritability was higher.ConclusionsOur results indicate that the accuracy of genomic prediction of carcass traits in Nellore cattle is moderate to high. Prediction of genomic breeding values from adjusted phenotypes Y* was more accurate than from EBV, especially for highly heritable traits. The three models considered (BRR, BC and BL) led to similar predictive abilities and, thus, either one could be used to implement genomic prediction for carcass traits in Nellore cattle.",2016,"Genetics, Selection, Evolution : GSE"

"Conflict Resolution , Public Goods and Patent Thickets October 8 th , 2014 Final Version","Post-grant validity challenges at patent offices rely on the private initiative of third parties to correct mistakes made by patent offices. We hypothesize that incentives to bring post-grant validity challenges are reduced when many firms benefit from revocation of a patent and when firms are caught up in patent thickets. Using data on opposition against patents at the European Patent Office we show that opposition decreases in fields in which many others profit from patent revocations. Moreover, in fields with a large number of mutually blocking patents the incidence of opposition is sharply reduced, particularly among large firms and firms that are caught up directly in patent thickets. These findings indicate that post-grant patent review may not constitute an effective correction device for erroneous patent grants in technologies affected by either patent thickets or highly dispersed patent ownership.

"Science Drive 2 Singapore 117546 Republic of Singapore TECHNICAL REPORT NO . 2 / 2006 July 10 , 2006 On Adaptive Sparse Principal Component Analysis","In this simple note, we attempt to further improve the sparse principal component analysis (SPCA) of Zou et al. (2006) on the following two aspects. First, we replace the traditional lasso penalty utilized in the original SPCA by the most recently developed adaptive lasso penalty (Zou, 2006; Wang et al., 2006). By doing so, adaptive amounts of shrinkage can be applied to different loading coefficients according to their estimated relative importance, which naturally improves the efficiency of the estimation and selection results. Secondly, a BIC-type tuning parameter selector is developed for a consistent selection of the tuning parameters. We refer to our approach as the adaptive sparse principal component analysis (ASPCA). Asymptotic theory is established to support such a proposal and numerical studies are conducted to further demonstrate its usefulness.",2006,
Urban Distribution Grid Topology Estimation via Group Lasso,"The growing penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) in urban areas raises multiple reliability issues. The topology reconstruction is a critical step to ensure the robustness of distribution grid operation. However, the bus connectivity and network topology reconstruction are hard in distribution grids. The reasons are that 1) the branches are challenging and expensive to monitor due to underground setup; 2) the inappropriate assumption of radial topology in many studies that urban grids are mesh. To address these drawbacks, we propose a new data-driven approach to reconstruct distribution grid topology by utilizing the newly available smart meter data. Specifically, a graphical model is built to model the probabilistic relationships among different voltage measurements. With proof, the bus connectivity and topology estimation problems are formulated as a linear regression problem with least absolute shrinkage on grouped variables (Group Lasso) to deal with meshed network structures. Simulation results show highly accurate estimation in IEEE standard distribution test systems with and without loops using real smart meter data.",2016,ArXiv
Prognostic microRNAs in patients operated for pancreatic cancer.,"4061 Background: The aim was to identify a panel of microRNAs (miRs) that can predict overall survival (OS) in non-microdissected tissues from patients operated for pancreatic cancer (PC).


METHODS
MiRs were purified from FFPE cancer tissue without microdissection from 225 patients operated for PC. Expression of miRs was determined using TaqMan Human MicroRNA Array. Univariate selection method and Lasso method were applied before the Cox proportional hazard model to relate miRs to OS.


RESULTS
At time of folow-up 196 (87%) of patients were dead. High expression of miR212 and miR675 and low expression of miR148*, miR187 and let7g* could predict OS independent of age, gender, KRASmutation, tumor stage, ASA-score, localization and differentiation of tumor (Table). A nomogram based on the adjusted Cox proportional hazard model was determined for these miRs and a prognostic index (PI) for each patient was calculated. The median survival was 1.09 years (CI 0.98-1.43) when PI was higher than median, compared to 2.23 years (CI 1.84-4.36) when PI was below median. The nine miRs that showed the strongest prediction ability by the Lasso method were miR212, miR675, miR187, miR205, miR944, miR431, miR194*, miR148a*, miR769-5p. Thus four miRs, miR212, 675, 187 and 148a*, were identified as predictors for OS in both statistical methods. High expression of miR675, 450b-5p and 222 and low expression of miR148a* and 146a could also predict 2 years OS independent of clinical characteristics.


CONCLUSIONS
Several miRs in PC tissue have the potential as new prognostic biomarkers in patients operated for PC. A prognostic index including 5 miRs can separate long term survivors after radical operation from patients with poor survival.

Building D1 at Magdala Revisited in the Light of Public Fountain Architecture in the Late-Hellenistic East *,"The small columnar Building D1 discovered at Magdala in the early 1970s was first identified by the excavators as a mini-synagogue. Although Ehud Netzer has convincingly opposed this view, arguing that the building functioned as af ountain house, some scholars challenge Netzer's identification, most notably on the basis of a doubtful comparison with a supposedly canonic type of Roman nymphaeum. Consequently, alternative interpretations for the function of this building, such as a synagogue or a latrine, continue to appear in the literature. This paper argues that the building has not been compared to the right category of public fountains. Indeed, Magdala's Building D1 presents strong similarities with contemporary examples of late-Hellenistic fountain architecture in Asia Minor and fits perfectly within the context of the long-term evolution of the so-called stoa- shapedfountainhouses.ThefunctionofBuildingD1asafountainhouse,asargued by Netzer, seems very likely, particularly on the basis of comparative data from the city of Sagalassos (south-west Turkey).",2012,Israel Exploration Journal
