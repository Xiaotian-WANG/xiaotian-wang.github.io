Union support recovery in high-dimensional multivariate regression,"In the problem of multivariate regression, a K-dimensional response vector is regressed upon a common set of p covariates, with a matrix B* isin RopfptimesK of regression coefficients. We study the behavior of the group Lasso using lscr1/lscr2 regularization for the union support problem, meaning that the set of s rows for which B* is non-zero is recovered exactly. Studying this problem under high-dimensional scaling, we show that group Lasso recovers the exact row pattern with high probability over the random design and noise for scalings of (n, p, s) such that the sample complexity parameter given by thetas(n, p, s) := n/[2psi(B*) log(p - s)] exceeds a critical threshold. Here n is the sample size, p is the ambient dimension of the regression model, s is the number of non-zero rows, and psi(B*) is a sparsity-overlap function that measures a combination of the sparsities and overlaps of the K-regression coefficient vectors that constitute the model. This sparsity-overlap function reveals that, if the design is uncorrelated on the active rows, block lscr1/lscr2 regularization for multivariate regression never harms performance relative to an ordinary Lasso approach, and can yield substantial improvements in sample complexity (up to a factor of K) when the regression vectors are suitably orthogonal. For more general designs, it is possible for the ordinary Lasso to outperform the group Lasso.",2008,"2008 46th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing"
Adaptive Lasso for generalized linear models with a diverging number of parameters,"ABSTRACT In this paper, we study the asymptotic properties of the adaptive Lasso estimators in high-dimensional generalized linear models. The consistency of the adaptive Lasso estimator is obtained. We show that, if a reasonable initial estimator is available, under appropriate conditions, the adaptive Lasso correctly selects covariates with non zero coefficients with probability converging to one, and that the estimators of non zero coefficients have the same asymptotic distribution they would have if the zero coefficients were known in advance. Thus, the adaptive Lasso has an Oracle property. The results are examined by some simulations and a real example.",2017,Communications in Statistics - Theory and Methods
"Taxonomy of deep-sea trachyleberidid, thaerocytherid, and hemicytherid genera (Ostracoda)","We conducted a comprehensive systematic revision of deep-sea Trachyleberididae, Thaerocytheridae, and Hemicytheridae (Ostracoda, Crustacea) covering almost all Cenozoic genera using high-resolution scanning electron microscopy. Trachyleberididae, our main focus, is one of the most diverse and abundant ostracod families, but its genus-level taxonomy is still confusing. Approximately 700 specimens from 177 species from 47 genera were examined. The studied samples range in age from the Cretaceous to the present day and cover all major oceans in the world, including the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and Southern Oceans, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Gulf of Mexico. Five new genera and 45 new species are described: Bensonodutoitella gen. nov., Hornibrookoleberis gen. nov., Croninocythereis gen. nov., Bensonocosta gen. nov., Ryugucivis gen. nov., Abyssocythere scotti sp. nov., Ambocythere tomocaudata sp. nov., Ambocythere whatleyi sp. nov., Ambocythere hyakunome sp. nov., Atlanticythere bensoni sp. nov., Atlanticythere oculi sp. nov., Dutoitella cronini sp. nov., Dutoitella symmetrica sp. nov., Dutoitella mazziniae sp. nov., Dutoitella paradinglei sp. nov., Dutoitella ayressi sp. nov., Dutoitella colesi sp. nov., Dutoitella spinosa sp. nov., Dutoitella whatleyi sp. nov., Dutoitella atlantiformis sp. nov., Bensonodutoitella bicornigeri sp. nov., Oligocythereis sylvesterbradleyi sp. nov., Cythereis guerneti sp. nov., Cythereis johnnealei sp. nov., Cythereis parajohnnealei sp. nov., Cythereis neoanteplana sp. nov., Cythereis sylvesterbradleyi sp. nov., Cythereis bensoni sp. nov., Cythereis purii sp. nov., Cythereis fungina sp. nov.,Cythereis tomcronini sp. nov., Cythereis legitimoformis sp. nov., Cythereis richardbensoni sp. nov., Cythereis dinglei sp.nov., Cythereis ovi sp. nov., Cythereis swansoni sp. nov., Croninocythereis tridentiferi sp. nov., Croninocythereis cronini sp. nov., Bensonocosta bensoni sp. nov., Ayressoleberis colesi sp. nov., Leguminocythereis? buzasi sp. nov., Legitimocythere tomi sp. nov., Ryugucivis jablonskii sp. nov., Ryugucivis acuminata sp. nov., Ryugucivis obtusa sp. nov., Phacorhabdotus mazzinireticulatus sp. nov., Phacorhabdotus nudus sp. nov., Phacorhabdotus slipperi sp. nov., Taracythere ayressoabyssora sp. nov., and Taracythere thalassoformis sp. nov. Emended concepts are proposed for several important genera to better stabilize their taxonomy. This study considerably reduces taxonomic uncertainty of this important component of the modern and fossil deep-sea ostracod community and provides a robust taxonomic baseline for deep-sea ostracod-based paleoceanographic, paleoecological, and macroevolutionary research.",2015,

Vijverberg et al. 1 Grey matter network differences between behavioral variant Frontotemporal Dementia and Alzheimerâ€™s disease,"We set out to study whether single-subject grey matter (GM) networks show disturbances that are specific for Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) (n=90) or behavioral variant Frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) (n=59), and whether such disturbances would be related to cognitive deficits measured with Mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and a neuropsychological battery, using subjective cognitive decline subjects (SCD) as reference. AD and bvFTD patients had a lower degree, connectivity density, clustering, path length, betweenness centrality and small world values compared to SCD. AD patients had a lower connectivity density than bvFTD patients (F = 5.79, p = 0.02; MeanÂ±SD bvFTD 16.10% Â± 1.19; MeanÂ±SD AD 15.64% Â± 1.02). Lasso logistic regression showed that connectivity differences between bvFTD and AD were specific to 23 anatomical areas, in terms of local GM volume, degree and clustering. Lower clustering values and lower degree values were specifically associated with worse MMSE scores and lower performance on the neuropsychological tests. GM showed disease-specific alterations, when comparing bvFTD with AD patients, and these alterations were associated with cognitive deficits.",2017,
Inverse covariance matrix estimation for the global minimum variance portfolio,"The estimation of inverse covariance matrices plays a major role in portfolio optimization, for the global minimum variance portfolio in mean-variance analysis it is the only parameter used to determine the asset allocation. In this thesis I propose to of use the graphical lasso methodology to directly estimate the inverse covariance matrix, and apply it to the global minimum variance portfolio. The results indicate that the graphical lasso provides better out-of-sample portfolio variance than the traditional sample estimator.",2017,
An L1 Representer Theorem for Multiple-Kernel Regression,"The theory of RKHS provides an elegant framework for supervised learning. It is the foundation of all kernel methods in machine learning. Implicit in its formulation is the use of a quadratic regularizer associated with the underlying inner product which imposes smoothness constraints. In this paper, we consider instead the generalized total-variation (gTV) norm as the sparsity-promoting regularizer. This leads us to propose a new Banach-space framework that justifies the use of generalized LASSO, albeit in a slightly modified version. We prove a representer theorem for multiple-kernel regression (MKR) with gTV regularization. The theorem states that the solutions of MKR have kernel expansions with adaptive positions, while the gTV norm enforces an $\ell_1$ penalty on the coefficients. We discuss the sparsity-promoting effect of the gTV norm which prevents redundancy in the multiple-kernel scenario.",2018,ArXiv
"Simultaneous regression shrinkage , variable selection and clustering of predictors with OSCAR","In this paper, a new method called the OSCAR (Octagonal Shrinkage and Clustering Algorithm for Regression) is proposed to simultaneously select variables and perform supervised clustering in the context of linear regression. The technique is based on penalized least squares with a geometrically intuitive penalty function that, like the LASSO penalty, shrinks some coefficients to exactly zero. Additionally, this penalty yields exact equality of some coefficients, encouraging correlated predictors that have a similar effect on the response to form clusters represented by a single coefficient. These resulting clusters can then be investigated further to discover what contributes to the group having a similar behavior. The OSCAR then enjoys sparseness in terms of the number of unique coefficients in the model. The proposed procedure is shown to compare favorably to the existing shrinkage and variable selection techniques in terms of both prediction error and reduced model complexity.",2006,
Feature Selection via Sequential Parallel LASSO for eQTL Analysis,"Human gene expression is subjected to multiple layers of controls including the impact of genetic variants. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating this genetic impact. In eQTL analysis, the data is typically high-dimensional whereas the number of observations exceed the number of samples. Therefore, sparse learning models are suitable for eQTL analysis. Sparse learning models have the ability to reflect the underlying biology in cases where only a small subset of genetic variants significantly affect gene expression. Therefore, sparse learning models such as LASSO, have shown their strengths to select associated features in high dimensional data. However, classical LASSO performs poorly when dealing with extremely high dimensional datasets in human genomic data. In this study, we introduce two novel methods named sequential LASSO and parallel LASSO. These methods allow efficient learning for datasets of ultra-high dimension. We theoretically prove the consistency of these methods when exact recovery is achieved in each sub-procedure. We further provided a multi-round process to address the sample size limitation in real applications. In addition to our theoretical analysis, we also perform extensive simulations on synthetic data to validate our methods. When applying to a real human genomics data set, we identify a set of SNP eQTLs that affect genes previously reported to be associated with human traits and diseases. Our methods are not limited to classical LASSO models and can be extended to variations of LASSO and many other machine learning models.

"The 2016 Economic and Product Market Databook for Bobo Dioulasso , Burkina Faso","Description: This study covers the outlook for products and services in Bobo Dioulasso. Estimates reported are given for the latent demand, or potential industry earnings (P.I.E.), for Bobo Dioulasso across hundreds of categories (in millions of U.S. dollars) and of the region and of the globe. These comparative benchmarks allow the reader to quickly gauge a Bobo Dioulasso vis-Ã -vis the world. Using econometric models which project fundamental economic dynamics, latent demand estimates are created. This report does not discuss the specific players in the market serving the latent demand, nor specific details at the product level. The study also does not consider short-term cyclicalities that might affect realized sales. The study, therefore, is strategic in nature, taking an aggregate and long-run view, irrespective of the players or products involved.",2016,
A parameter-free MAP image reconstruction algorithm for impulse-based UWB ground penetrating radar,"In this paper, we propose a parameter-free image reconstruction algorithm that is based on the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation method and so called ""integrate-out"" approach for determining the prior distribution. The resulting objective function is minimized using the majorize-minimize optimization technique. The proposed algorithm avoids the computational burden associated with using cross-validation methods for choosing the penalty parameter in the popular least absolute shrinkage and selector operator (LASSO) method. We tested the algorithm on synthetic data obtained from the U.S Army Research Laboratory (ARL) in Adelphi, MD. As compared to the image reconstructed using the delay-and-sum algorithm, the reconstructed images is more sparse, with suppressed side lobes and background noise.",2015,2015 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)

Controlling false discoveries in Bayesian gene networks with lasso regression p-values,"Motivation Bayesian networks can represent directed gene regulations and therefore are favored over co-expression networks. However, hardly any Bayesian network study concerns the false discovery control (FDC) of network edges, leading to low accuracies due to systematic biases from inconsistent false discovery levels in the same study. Results We design four empirical tests to examine the FDC of Bayesian networks from three p-value based lasso regression variable selections â€” two existing and one we originate. Our method, lassopv, computes p-values for the critical regularization strength at which a predictor starts to contribute to lasso regression. Using null and Geuvadis datasets, we find that lassopv obtains optimal FDC in Bayesian gene networks, whilst existing methods have defective p-values. The FDC concept and tests extend to most network inference scenarios and will guide the design and improvement of new and existing methods. Our novel variable selection method with lasso regression also allows FDC on other datasets and questions, even beyond network inference and computational biology.

Homotopy Parametric Simplex Method for Sparse Learning,"High dimensional sparse learning has imposed a great computational challenge to large scale data analysis. In this paper, we are interested in a broad class of sparse learning approaches formulated as linear programs parametrized by a {\em regularization factor}, and solve them by the parametric simplex method (PSM). Our parametric simplex method offers significant advantages over other competing methods: (1) PSM naturally obtains the complete solution path for all values of the regularization parameter; (2) PSM provides a high precision dual certificate stopping criterion; (3) PSM yields sparse solutions through very few iterations, and the solution sparsity significantly reduces the computational cost per iteration. Particularly, we demonstrate the superiority of PSM over various sparse learning approaches, including Dantzig selector for sparse linear regression, LAD-Lasso for sparse robust linear regression, CLIME for sparse precision matrix estimation, sparse differential network estimation, and sparse Linear Programming Discriminant (LPD) analysis. We then provide sufficient conditions under which PSM always outputs sparse solutions such that its computational performance can be significantly boosted. Thorough numerical experiments are provided to demonstrate the outstanding performance of the PSM method.",2017,ArXiv

Slope meets Lasso: improved oracle bounds and optimality,"We show that two polynomial time methods, a Lasso estimator with adaptively chosen tuning parameter and a Slope estimator, adaptively achieve the exact minimax prediction and $\ell_2$ estimation rate $(s/n)\log (p/s)$ in high-dimensional linear regression on the class of $s$-sparse target vectors in $\mathbb R^p$. This is done under the Restricted Eigenvalue (RE) condition for the Lasso and under a slightly more constraining assumption on the design for the Slope. The main results have the form of sharp oracle inequalities accounting for the model misspecification error. The minimax optimal bounds are also obtained for the $\ell_q$ estimation errors with $1\le q\le 2$ when the model is well-specified. The results are non-asymptotic, and hold both in probability and in expectation. The assumptions that we impose on the design are satisfied with high probability for a large class of random matrices with independent and possibly anisotropically distributed rows. We give a comparative analysis of conditions, under which oracle bounds for the Lasso and Slope estimators can be obtained. In particular, we show that several known conditions, such as the RE condition and the sparse eigenvalue condition are equivalent if the $\ell_2$-norms of regressors are uniformly bounded.",2016,arXiv: Statistics Theory
A model and regularization scheme for ultrasonic beamforming clutter reduction,"Acoustic clutter produced by off-axis and multipath scattering is known to cause image degradation, and in some cases these sources may be the prime determinants of in vivo image quality. We have previously shown some success addressing these sources of image degradation by modeling the aperture domain signal from different sources of clutter, and then decomposing aperture domain data using the modeled sources. Our previous model had some shortcomings including model mismatch and failure to recover B-Mode speckle statistics. These shortcomings are addressed here by developing a better model and by using a general regularization approach appropriate for the model and data. We present results with L1 (lasso), L2 (ridge), and L1/L2 combined (elastic-net) regularization methods. We call our new method aperture domain model image reconstruction (ADMIRE). Our results demonstrate that ADMIRE with L1 regularization, or weighted toward L1 in the case of elastic-net regularization, have improved image quality. L1 by itself works well, but additional improvements are seen with elastic-net regularization over the pure L1 constraint. On in vivo example cases, L1 regularization showed mean contrast improvements of 4.6 and 6.8 dB on fundamental and harmonic images, respectively. Elastic net regularization (Î± = 0.9) showed mean contrast improvements of 17.8 dB on fundamental images and 11.8 dB on harmonic images. We also demonstrate that in uncluttered Field II simulations the de-cluttering algorithm produces the same contrast, contrast-to-noise ratio, and speckle SNR as normal B-mode imaging, demonstrating that ADMIRE preserves typical image features.",2015,"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control"
A Bayesian Markov-switching Model for Sparse Dynamic Network Estimation,"Inferring Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs) from multivariate time series data is a key step towards the understanding of complex systems as it reveals important dependency relationship underlying such systems. Most of the traditional approaches assume a â€œstaticâ€ DBN. Yet in many relevant applications, such as those arising in biology and social sciences, the dependency structures may vary over time. In this paper, we introduce a sparse Markov-switching vector autoregressive model to capture the structural changes in the dependency relationships over time. Our approach accounts for such structural changes via a set of latent state variables, which are modeled by a discrete-time discretestate Markov process. Assuming that the underlying structures are sparse, we estimate the networks at each state through the hierarchical Bayesian group Lasso, so as to efficiently capture dependencies with lags greater than one time unit. For computation, we develop an efficient algorithm based on the Expectation-Maximization method. We demonstrate the strength of our approach through simulation studies and a real data set concerning climate change.",2012,

Ultimately, Heideggerâ€™s emphasis on ontology in philosophy is superior in its ability to give a more comprehensive account of science and thinking about things themselves.",2014,The Journal of Speculative Philosophy
Regularized Pre-image Estimation for Kernel PCA De-noising,"The main challenge in de-noising by kernel Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is the mapping of de-noised feature space points back into input space, also referred to as â€œthe pre-image problemâ€. Since the feature space mapping is typically not bijective, pre-image estimation is inherently illposed. As a consequence the most widely used estimation schemes lack stability. A common way to stabilize such estimates is by augmenting the cost function by a suitable constraint on the solution values. For de-noising applications we here propose Tikhonov input space distance regularization as a stabilizer for pre-image estimation, or sparse reconstruction by Lasso regularization in cases where the main objective is to improve the visual simplicity. We perform extensive experiments on the USPS digit modeling problem to evaluate the stability of three widely used pre-image estimators. We show that the previous methods lack stability in the is non-linear regime, however, by applying our proposed input space distance regularizer the estimates are stabilized with a limited sacrifice in terms of de-noising efficiency. Furthermore, we show how sparse reconstruction can lead to improved visual quality of the estimated pre-image.",2011,Journal of Signal Processing Systems
Sparse Regression: Scalable algorithms and empirical performance,"In this paper, we review state-of-the-art methods for feature selection in statistics with an application-oriented eye. Indeed, sparsity is a valuable property and the profusion of research on the topic might have provided little guidance to practitioners. We demonstrate empirically how noise and correlation impact both the accuracy - the number of correct features selected - and the false detection - the number of incorrect features selected - for five methods: the cardinality-constrained formulation, its Boolean relaxation, $\ell_1$ regularization and two methods with non-convex penalties. A cogent feature selection method is expected to exhibit a two-fold convergence, namely the accuracy and false detection rate should converge to $1$ and $0$ respectively, as the sample size increases. As a result, proper method should recover all and nothing but true features. Empirically, the integer optimization formulation and its Boolean relaxation are the closest to exhibit this two properties consistently in various regimes of noise and correlation. In addition, apart from the discrete optimization approach which requires a substantial, yet often affordable, computational time, all methods terminate in times comparable with the \verb|glmnet| package for Lasso. We released code for methods that were not publicly implemented. Jointly considered, accuracy, false detection and computational time provide a comprehensive assessment of each feature selection method and shed light on alternatives to the Lasso-regularization which are not as popular in practice yet.",2019,arXiv: Methodology

Ces test ont revele que l'antiserum contient des anticorps specifiques a une opsine que l'on peut trouver dans les photorecepteurs en cones individuels du Poisson rouge, de la truite et de la girelle. Ces resultats confirment ceux d'etudes anterieures sur le Poisson rouge qui attribuaient la sensibilite aux longueurs d'onde courtes a des cones individuels et semblent indiquer que l'association entre la sensibilite aux ondes courtes et la presence de cones individuels est une caracteristique commune a plusieurs teleosteens.

Non-Invasive Fuhrman Grading of Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma Using Computed Tomography Radiomics Features and Machine Learning,"Purpose: To identify optimal classification methods for computed tomography (CT) radiomics-based preoperative prediction of clear cells renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) grade. Methods and material: Seventy one ccRCC patients were included in the study. Three image preprocessing techniques (Laplacian of Gaussian, wavelet filter, and discretization of the intensity values) were applied on tumor volumes. In total, 2530 radiomics features (tumor shape and size, intensity statistics, and texture) were extracted from each segmented tumor volume. Univariate analysis was performed to assess the association of each feature with the histological condition. In the case of multivariate analysis, the following was implemented: three feature selection including the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), students t-test and minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) algorithms. These selected features were then used to construct three classification models (SVM, random forest, and logistic regression) to discriminate the high from low-grade ccRCC at nephrectomy. Lastly, multivariate model performance was evaluated on the bootstrapped validation cohort using the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results: Univariate analysis demonstrated that among different image sets, 128 bin discretized images have statistically significant different (q-value < 0.05) texture parameters with a mean of AUC 0.74 (q-value < 0.05). The three ML-based classifier shows proficient discrimination of the high from low-grade ccRCC. The AUC was 0.78 in logistic regression, 0.62 in random forest, and 0.83 in SVM model, respectively. Conclusion: Radiomics features can be a useful and promising non-invasive method for preoperative evaluation of ccRCC Fuhrman grades.

Positive definite estimators of large covariance matrices,"Using convex optimization, we construct a sparse estimator of the covariance matrix that is positive definite and performs well in high-dimensional settings. A lasso-type penalty is used to encourage sparsity and a logarithmic barrier function is used to enforce positive definiteness. Consistency and convergence rate bounds are established as both the number of variables and sample size diverge. An efficient computational algorithm is developed and the merits of the approach are illustrated with simulations and a speech signal classification example.

Theology and Theatre in the Poems of Orlando di Lassoâ€™s Prophetiae Sibyllarum,"Peter Bergquistâ€™s identification of a source for the Latin poems of Orlando di Lassoâ€™s enigmatic motet cycle Prophetiae Sibyllarum remains a landmark contribution to the literature.2 On the ambiguous genesis of the Sibyl cycle he notes that â€œexternal evidence about the provenance of the poems should of course be taken into account in any attempt to resolve such questions.â€3 Bergquistâ€™s discussion of the transmission of the poems, the limited sketch of Sibylline tradition he provides, and his ultimate conclusions regarding the source of the poems have all had significant influence upon the direction and underlying assumptions of Sibyl cycle research since his report first appeared in 1979. The present study carries Bergquistâ€™s work forward, drawing from more recent interdisciplinary scholarship on Sibylline tradition and the prominent role it played in Renaissance culture.4 In this essay our primary goal is to elucidate the constellation of prophetic utterances originating in Italian humanist culture that stands directly behind",2017,
Acanthurids Do Not Avoid Consuming Cultured Toxic Dinoflagellates yet Do Not Become Ciguatoxic,"Abstract Ocean surgeons Acanthurus bahianus and doctorfish A. chirurgus displayed no preference between food items containing toxic dinoflagellates associated with ciguatera poisoning and nontoxic food when given a choice for up to 42 consecutive days.

Chemistry and chemical ecology of the Bahamian spongeAplysilla glacialis,"Chemical investigation of the secondary metabolites of the marine spongeAplysilla glacialis collected at French Wells, Crooked Island, Bahamas, resulted in the isolation and characterization of four diterpenes, two sterol endoperoxides, and two methylated primary metabolites. Some of these compounds, along with crude extracts of the sponge, were investigated for their ability to deter fish predation, affect the fouling of surfaces, and inhibit the growth of marine microorganisms. The diterpene manoÃ¶l (3), cholesterol endoperoxide (4), and the crude nonpolar extract ofA. glacialis were shown to deter feeding by a natural assemblage of fish predators in an in situ assay conducted at French Wells. Pure secondary metabolites and crude extracts ofA. glacialis also were tested in a laboratory fish feeding assay employing the wrasseThalassoma lunare. A mixture of sterol endoperoxides was isolated from the mucus that coats the surface ofA. glacialis and is exuded in large quantities when the sponge is disturbed. These compounds are thereby distributed in a manner in which they can best serve a defensive role for the sponge. An in situ assay was designed to determine the effect that pure secondary metabolites and crude extracts have on the fouling of surfaces. ManoÃ¶l (3) and cholesterol endoperoxide (4) were determined to increase the rate of fouling when compared to control surfaces. 1-Methyladenine (5) was identified as an antimicrobial constituent ofA. glacialis that inhibited the growth of four marine bacteria isolated from seawater samples collected at French Wells.",2004,Journal of Chemical Ecology
18-Month mortality and perinatal exposure to zidovudine in West Africa.,"OBJECTIVES
To study mortality in African children born to HIV-1-infected mothers exposed peripartum to zidovudine.


METHODS
A randomized placebo-controlled trial in Abidjan and Bobo-Dioulasso. Pregnant women received either 300 mg zidovudine twice daily from 36-38 weeks' gestation, 600 mg during labour, and 300 mg twice daily for 7 days post-partum or a matching placebo. Determinants of mortality were studied up to 18 months, overall and among the infected children: treatment, centre, timing of infection, mother and child HIV disease.


RESULTS
There were 75 infant deaths among 407 live births. The risk of death at 18 months was 176/1000 in the zidovudine arm and 221 for placebo. Relative hazard (RH, zidovudine versus placebo) was 0.47 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.2-1.0] up to 230 days of life. Maternal CD4 lymphocyte count < 200/mm3 (RH 2.92; CI 1.4-6.1) and child HIV-1 infection (RH 12.6; CI 6.6-24.3) increased mortality of all children born to HIV-1-infected mothers. There were 101 children infected (40 in the zidovudine group), and 51 died. Their 18 month probability of death was 590/1000 in the zidovudine group and 510 in the placebo group. Among infected children, maternal zidovudine reduced the risk of death on or before day 230 (RH 0.18; CI 0.1-0.5). Maternal CD4 lymphocyte count < 200/mm3 (RH 3.25; CI 1.3-8.4), maternal death (RH 9.65; CI 1.7-56.0), diagnosis of paediatric infection on or before day 12 (RH 18.1; CI 4.8-69.0) and between days 13 and 45 (RH 7.63; CI 2.0-29.5), clinical paediatric AIDS (RH 5.37; CI 2.3-12.7) were risk factors for death in HIV-1-infected children.


CONCLUSION
Mother-to-child transmission reduction by zidovudine is safe and beneficial to African children. The mortality of HIV-1-infected children is high. Peripartum maternal zidovudine exerts a protective effect for at least 8 months.",2001,AIDS

"Household and Community Organization at Nimatlala, an Island Chumash Village on Limuw (Santa Cruz Island), California","Author(s): Sutton, Elizabeth Anne | Advisor(s): Glassow, Michael A | Abstract: The Chumash living in the Santa Barbara Channel region at the time of European contact in AD 1542, and into the Early Historic period (AD 1782-1834), are described in historic documents as living a sedentary lifestyle settled in large, permanent villages. Although archaeologists working in the region today have a number of historical sources and ethnographic records to contextualize their work, little archaeological research using modern excavation and laboratory techniques has been undertaken, and much remains unknown about how the Chumash organized their households and communities and constructed economic, political, and social relationships.Recently, a few late prehistoric and historic sites on the Northern Channel Islands have been identified and recorded away from permanent village sites. Three of these small sites (SCRI-324, -384, -801) located in the interior of Santa Cruz Island are believed to represent the Early Historic period village of Nimatlala. These sites appear to be very different from other Early Historic period villages in that they contain smaller house depressions and shallow midden deposits. Excavation of houses and deposits at SCRI-324 and SCRI-384 was undertaken in an effort to discern the chronology of occupation, the organization of households and the community as a whole, and the nature of activities undertaken at the site.Results indicate that the houses were occupied by fewer individuals than was typical, although residents of the village did invest substantial labor at the sites, constructing houses and possibly a small sweat lodge. This suggests that while occupation may not have been permanent, it was significant. Residents were involved in a number of activities including the production of shell beads and ornaments, the production and maintenance of stone tools, and the collection and processing of plant and animal foods. Additionally, an analysis of the activities in which the community was engaged reveals how residents created and maintained their identity through daily practice against the backdrop of significant social, political, and economic transformation in colonial-era California.",2014,

Regularized Ordinal Regression and the ordinalNet R Package,"Regularization techniques such as the lasso (Tibshirani 1996) and elastic net (Zou and Hastie 2005) can be used to improve regression model coefficient estimation and prediction accuracy, as well as to perform variable selection. Ordinal regression models are widely used in applications where the use of regularization could be beneficial; however, these models are not included in many popular software packages for regularized regression. We propose a coordinate descent algorithm to fit a broad class of ordinal regression models with an elastic net penalty. Furthermore, we demonstrate that each model in this class generalizes to a more flexible form, for instance to accommodate unordered categorical data. We introduce an elastic net penalty class that applies to both model forms. Additionally, this penalty can be used to shrink a non-ordinal model toward its ordinal counterpart. Finally, we introduce the R package ordinalNet, which implements the algorithm for this model class.",2017,arXiv: Computation
Corpus Callosum Radiomics-Based Classification Model in Alzheimer's Disease: A Case-Control Study,"Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that causes the decline of some cognitive impairments. The present study aimed to identify the corpus callosum (CC) radiomic features related to the diagnosis of AD and build and evaluate a classification model. Methods: Radiomics analysis was applied to the three-dimensional T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) images of 78 patients with AD and 44 healthy controls (HC). The CC, in each subject, was segmented manually and 385 features were obtained after calculation. Then, the feature selection were carried out. The logistic regression model was constructed and evaluated according to identified features. Thus, the model can be used for distinguishing the AD from HC subjects. Results: Eleven features were selected from the three-dimensional T1-weighted MPRAGE images using the LASSO model, following which, the logistic regression model was constructed. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precision, and positive and negative predictive values were 0.720, 0.792, 0.500, 0.684, 0.731, 0.731, and 0.583, respectively. Conclusion: The results demonstrated the potential of CC texture features as a biomarker for the diagnosis of AD. This is the first study showing that the radiomics model based on machine learning was a valuable method for the diagnosis of AD.",2018,Frontiers in Neurology
Positive Definite Estimation of Large Covariance Matrix Using Generalized Nonconvex Penalties,"This paper addresses the issue of large covariance matrix estimation in a high-dimensional statistical analysis. Recently, improved iterative algorithms with positive-definite guarantee have been developed. However, these algorithms cannot be directly extended to use a nonconvex penalty for sparsity inducing. In general, a nonconvex penalty has the capability of ameliorating the bias problem of the popular convex lasso penalty, and thus is more advantageous. In this paper, we propose a class of positive-definite covariance estimators using generalized nonconvex penalties. We develop a first-order algorithm based on the alternating direction method framework to solve the nonconvex optimization problem efficiently. The convergence of this algorithm has been proved. Furthermore, the statistical properties of the new estimators have been analyzed for generalized nonconvex penalties. Moreover, extension of this algorithm to covariance estimation from sketched measurements has been considered. The performances of the new estimators have been demonstrated by both a simulation study and a gene clustering example for tumor tissues. Code for the proposed estimators is available at https://github.com/FWen/Nonconvex-PDLCE.git.",2016,IEEE Access

Complex lasso: new entangled motifs in proteins,"We identify new entangled motifs in proteins that we call complex lassos. Lassos arise in proteins with disulfide bridges (or in proteins with amide linkages), when termini of a protein backbone pierce through an auxiliary surface of minimal area, spanned on a covalent loop. We find that as much as 18% of all proteins with disulfide bridges in a non-redundant subset of PDB form complex lassos, and classify them into six distinct geometric classes, one of which resembles supercoiling known from DNA. Based on biological classification of proteins we find that lassos are much more common in viruses, plants and fungi than in other kingdoms of life. We also discuss how changes in the oxidation/reduction potential may affect the function of proteins with lassos. Lassos and associated surfaces of minimal area provide new, interesting and possessing many potential applications geometric characteristics not only of proteins, but also of other biomolecules.",2016,Scientific Reports
"Adaptive estimation of the baseline hazard function in the Cox model by model selection, with high-dimensional covariates","The purpose of this article is to provide an adaptive estimator of the baseline function in the Cox model with high-dimensional covariates. We consider a two-step procedure : first, we estimate the regression parameter of the Cox model via a Lasso procedure based on the partial log-likelihood, secondly, we plug this Lasso estimator into a least-squares type criterion and then perform a model selection procedure to obtain an adaptive penalized contrast estimator of the baseline function. Using non-asymptotic estimation results stated for the Lasso estimator of the regression parameter, we establish a non-asymptotic oracle inequality for this penalized contrast estimator of the baseline function, which highlights the discrepancy of the rate of convergence when the dimension of the covariates increases.",2015,arXiv: Statistics Theory
Development of a novel probabilistic algorithm for localization of rotors during atrial fibrillation,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an irregular heart rhythm that can lead to stroke and other heart-related complications. Catheter ablation has been commonly used to destroy triggering sources of AF in the atria and consequently terminate the arrhythmia. However, efficient and accurate localization of the AF sustaining sources known as rotors is a major challenge in catheter ablation. In this paper, we developed a novel probabilistic algorithm that can adaptively guide a Lasso diagnostic catheter to locate the center of a rotor. Our algorithm uses a Bayesian updating approach to search for and locate rotors based on the characteristics of electrogram signals collected at every catheter placement. The algorithm was evaluated using a 10 Ã— 10 cm 2 D atrial tissue simulation of the Nygren human atrial cell model and was able to successfully guide the catheter to the rotor center in 3.37 Â± 1.05 (meanÂ±std) steps (including placement at the center) when starting from any location on the tissue. Our novel automated algorithm can potentially play a significant role in patient-specific ablation of AF sources and increase the success of AF elimination procedures.",2016,Conference proceedings : ...

A high frequency GaAlAs travelling wave electro-optic modulator at 0.82 micrometers,"SUMMARY Experimental GaAlAs modulators operating at 0.82 |im using a Mach-Zehnderinterferometer configuration were designed and fabricated. Coplanar 50 Q trav-elling wave microwave electrodes were used to obtain a bandwidth-length productof 11.95 GHz-cm. The design, fabrication and DC performance of the GaAlAstravelling wave modulator, is presented. INTRODUCTION The development of high frequency integrated microwave-optical componentsand circuits on GaAs substrates is required for highly agile and light weightoptically controlled GaAs MMIC based phased array antennas for future spacecommunication and tracking systems (ref. 1). External modulation of a GaAlAssolid state laser output by a modulator is a means to convert a microwave sig-nal, to an optical.signal, thus allowing the benefits of low weight and lowcrosstalk to. be applied to these systems.Waveguide electro-optic indirect modulators fabricated on LiNb03 and GaAssubstrates and operating at 1.3 vim have previously been reported in the litera-ture (refs. 2 to 4). It is unlikely that with the present technology, LiNb03modulators can easily be integrated with the present day GaAs MMIC sub-strates. On the other hand, GaAs modulators cannot be integrated with GaAlAslaser sources due to high absorption of the GaAs at 0.82 \im wavelength.In this paper, we present the fabrication of a triple heterostructureGaAlAs travelling wave electro-optic modulator which operates at 0.82 jam wave-length and avoids the absorption -problems associated with pure GaAs. Thedetailed analysis and design of the electro-optic modulator has been previouslyreported (refs. 5 and 6). The modulator uses a 50 Q travelling wave coplanarwaveguide electrode and needs no matching network. It has a high bandwidthand is capable of integration with GaAs/GaAlAs laser diodes. Although GaAshas a smaller electro-optic coefficient and requires higher microwave drivepower levels than LiNb03, the modulator presented here allows true integrationwith GaAs MMIC technology.. â€¢ ,",1988,

Automated Clear Cell Renal Carcinoma Grade Classification with Prognostic Significance,"We developed an automated 2-tiered Fuhrmanâ€™s grading system for clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Whole slide images (WSI) and clinical data were retrieved for 395 The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) ccRCC cases. Pathologist 1 reviewed and selected regions of interests (ROIs). Nuclear segmentation was performed. Quantitative morphological, intensity, and texture features (n=72) were extracted. Features associated with grade were identified by constructing a Lasso model using data from cases with concordant 2-tiered Fuhrmanâ€™s grades between TCGA and Pathologist 1 (training set n=235; held-out test set n=42). Discordant cases (n=118) were additionally reviewed by Pathologist 2. Cox proportional hazard model evaluated the prognostic efficacy of the predicted grades in an extended test set which was created by combining the test set and discordant cases (n=160). The Lasso model consisted of 26 features and predicted grade with 84.6% sensitivity and 81.3% specificity in the test set. In the extended test set, predicted grade was significantly associated with overall survival after adjusting for age and gender (Hazard Ratio 2.05; 95% CI 1.21-3.47); manual grades were not prognostic. Future work can adapt our computational system to predict WHO/ISUP grades, and validating this system on other ccRCC cohorts.",2019,bioRxiv
The community structure of the deep-sea nematode community associated with polymetallic nodules in the Central Indian Ocean Basin,"Abstract Technological advances have led to an increase in the number of investigations in the deep sea over the last two decades. However, despite a large number of scientific cruises, few published data on the nematode biodiversity and community structure are available from the abyssal nodule fields of the Central Indian Ocean Basin (CIOB). It is well known that CIOB harbors one of the largest high-grade nodule reservoirs and has therefore gained the most attention from industries and governments. Therefore, to adequately assess the potential environmental impacts of deep-sea polymetallic nodule mining in CIOB, more quantitative samples are needed to better understand trends in nematode diversity, abundance, and community structure in the nodule fields. Recently, on the basis of detailed surveys and analysis, a Test Mine Site (TMS) and Reference Mining Site (TRS) have been identified within the First Generation Mine Site (FGM) for further detailed studies. According to ISA guidelines, the TMS and TRS need to be similar in faunal abundance, composition and diversity, nodule abundances, metal grade and environmental data. As per the deep-sea environment conservation point of view, particularly to plan mining operations, the study has been done to check whether TMS and TRS have a similar type of faunal assemblage so that impacts and the ensuing loss of biota are minimized. To address this, we compared the composition and distribution of nematode communities at genus/species level from TMS and TRS. The average nematode density ranged from 71.68 Â± 1.7 inds/10â€¯cm2 in the TRS and 91.23 Â± 1.3 inds/10â€¯cm2 in the TMS. A total of 63 nematode genera belonging to 24 families were identified from TMS. The TRS samples supported 52 genera belonging to 20 families. A homogeneous community was observed at family/genus level from the TMS and TRS, particularly dominated by cosmopolitan nematode genera like Acantholaimus, Halalaimus, Thalasomonhystera and Leptolaimus. The TRS and TMS samples did exhibit a similar evenness (J'), and diversity (Hâ€™) suggesting a homogeneous nematode community throughout the area. Taxon diversity and richness estimators revealed that the current sampling design was able to characterize the majority of the nematode genera present. It can be suggested that the entire area of sampling is inhabited by a single, uniformly distributed, nematode assemblage at the genus level. This study also addresses whether or not nematode assemblages at genus/ species level inhabiting the bare sediment (soft sediment without nodules) in abyssal nodule fields are unique and differ from those found in the crevices of polymetallic nodules. As expected, there were fewer numbers of total genera recorded from the crevices with the differences being found in the dominant genera and families. Thalassomonhystera, Acantholaimus and Desmoscolex were noted as characteristic of the bare sediment while Leptolaimus and Camacolaimus showed the highest likelihood in nodule crevices. Hard nodule crevice substratum does favor some species level morphotypes of the genus Leptolaimus and Camacolaimus since these morphotypes were found exclusively in nodule crevices. However, owing to the still limited sampling effort in the deep sea, it is premature to suggest that these species are endemic to nodules. Implications of the present findings for environmental management and future research needs are provided.",2019,Deep-sea Research Part Ii-topical Studies in Oceanography
Screening for Cognitive Impairment by Model-Assisted Cerebral Blood Flow Estimation,"Objective: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and debilitating neurodegenerative disease; a major health concern in the ageing population with an estimated prevalence of 46 million dementia cases worldwide. Early diagnosis is therefore crucial so mitigating treatments can be initiated at an early stage. Cerebral hypoperfusion has been linked with blood-brain barrier dysfunction in the early stages of AD, and screening for chronic cerebral hypoperfusion in individuals has been proposed for improving the early diagnosis of AD. However, ambulatory measurements of cerebral blood flow are not routinely carried out in the clinical setting. In this study, we combine physiological modeling with Holter blood pressure monitoring and carotid ultrasound imaging to predict 24-h cerebral blood flow (CBF) profiles in individuals. One hundred and three participants [53 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 50 healthy controls] underwent model-assisted prediction of 24-h CBF. Model-predicted CBF and neuropsychological tests were features in lasso regression models for MCI diagnosis. Results: A CBF-enhanced classifier for diagnosing MCI performed better, area-under-the-curve (AUC) = 0.889 (95%-CI: 0.800 to 0.978), than a classifier based only on the neuropsychological test scores, AUC = 0.818 (95%-CI: 0.643 to 0.992). An additional cohort of 25 participants (11 MCI and 14 healthy) was recruited to perform model validation by arterial spin-labeling magnetic resonance imaging, and to establish a link between measured CBF that predicted by the model. Conclusion: Ultrasound imaging and ambulatory blood pressure measurements enhanced with physiological modeling can improve MCI diagnosis accuracy.",2018,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering
A Compact Neural Network for Fused Lasso Signal Approximator.,"The fused lasso signal approximator (FLSA) is a vital optimization problem with extensive applications in signal processing and biomedical engineering. However, the optimization problem is difficult to solve since it is both nonsmooth and nonseparable. The existing numerical solutions implicate the use of several auxiliary variables in order to deal with the nondifferentiable penalty. Thus, the resulting algorithms are both time- and memory-inefficient. This paper proposes a compact neural network to solve the FLSA. The neural network has a one-layer structure with the number of neurons proportionate to the dimension of the given signal, thanks to the utilization of consecutive projections. The proposed neural network is stable in the Lyapunov sense and is guaranteed to converge globally to the optimal solution of the FLSA. Experiments on several applications from signal processing and biomedical engineering confirm the reasonable performance of the proposed neural network.",2019,IEEE transactions on cybernetics
Optimization of Lipase production from a novel strain Thalassospira permensis M35-15 using Response Surface Methodology.,"Lipases can catalyze the hydrolysis of glycerol, esters and long chain fatty acids. A lipase producing isolate M35-15 was screened and identified as Thalassospira permensis using 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. To our knowledge this is the first report on Thalassospira permensis producing lipases. In this paper the optimization of medium composition for the increase in bacterial lipase was achieved using statistical methods. Firstly the key ingredients were selected by Plackett-Burman experimental design, then the levels of the ingredients were optimized using central composite design of Response Surface Methodology. The predicted optimal lipase activity was 11.49Â U under the conditions that medium composition were 5.15Â g/l glucose, 11.74Â g/l peptone, 6.74Â g/l yeast powder and 22.90Â g/l olive oil emulsifier.",2016,Bioengineered

CancerClock: A DNA Methylation Age Predictor to Identify and Characterize Aging Clock in Pan-Cancer,"Many biological indicators related to chronological age have been proposed. Recent studies found that epigenetic clock or DNA methylation age is highly correlated with chronological age. In particular, a significant difference between DNA methylation age (m-age) and chronological age was observed in cancers. However, the prediction and characterization of m-age in pan-cancer remains an explored area. In this study, 1,631 age-related methylation sites in normal tissues were discovered and analyzed. A comprehensive computational model named CancerClock was constructed to predict the m-age for normal samples based on methylation levels of the extracted methylation sites. LASSO linear regression model was used to screen and train the CancerClock model in normal tissues. The accuracy of CancerClock has proved to be 81%, and the correlation value between chronological age and m-age was 0.939 (P < 0.01). Next, CancerClock was used to evaluate the difference between m-age and chronological age for 33 cancer types from TCGA. There were significant differences between predicted m-age and chronological age in large number of cancer samples. These cancer samples were defined as ""age-related cancer samples"" and they have some differential methylation sites. The differences between predicted m-age and chronological age may contribute to cancer development. Some of these differential methylation sites were associated with cancer survival. CancerClock provided assistance in estimating the m-age in normal and cancer samples. The changes between m-age and chronological age may improve the diagnosis and prognosis of cancers.",2019,Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology
The predictive power of earnings conference calls : predicting stock price movement with earnings call transcripts,"Earnings conference calls are considered a valuable text based information source for investors. This paper investigates the possibility to predict the direction of stock prices by analyzing the transcripts of earnings conference calls. The paper investigates 29 339 different earnings call transcript from 2014 to 2017 and classify the individual documents to either be part of class up or down. Four different machine learning algorithms are used to classify and predict based on the bag of words method. These machine learning algorithms are Naive Bayes, Logistic regression with lasso regularization, Stochastic Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Machine. All models are compared to a benchmarks based on S&P 500. The model with best performance is logistic regression with a classification error of 43,8%. In total, 2 of 4 models beats the benchmark significantly, namely logistic regression and gradient boosting. With these results, the paper concludes that earnings calls contain predicting power for next dayâ€™s stock price direction.",2018,
Distributed Reconstruction of Nonlinear Networks: An ADMM Approach,"Abstract In this paper, we present a distributed algorithm for the reconstruction of large-scale nonlinear networks. In particular, we focus on the identification from time-series data of the nonlinear functional forms and associated parameters of large-scale nonlinear networks. In the previous work, a nonlinear network reconstruction problem was formulated as a nonconvex optimisation problem based on the combination of a marginal likelihood maximisation procedure with sparsity inducing priors. In this paper, we derive an iterative reweighted lasso algorithm to solve the initial nonconvex optimisation problem based on the concave-convex procedure (CCCP). Moreover, by exploiting the structure of the objective function of this algorithm, a distributed algorithm is designed. To this end, we apply the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to decompose the original problem into several subproblems. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, we use our approach to identify a network of interconnected Kuramoto oscillators with different network sizes (500~100,000 nodes).",2014,ArXiv
Phage therapy of the white plague-like disease of Favia favus in the Red Sea,"Coral disease is a major factor in the global decline of coral reefs. At present, there are no known procedures for preventing or treating infectious diseases of corals. Immunization is not possible because corals have a restricted adaptive immune system and antibiotics are neither ecologically safe nor practical in an open system. Thus, we tested phage therapy as an alternative therapeutic method for treating diseased corals. Phage BA3, specific to the coral pathogen Thalassomonas loyana, inhibited the progression of the white plague-like disease and transmission to healthy corals in the Gulf of Aqaba, Red Sea. Only one out of 19 (5Â %) of the healthy corals became infected when placed near phage-treated diseased corals, whereas 11 out of 18 (61Â %) healthy corals were infected in the no-phage control. This is the first successful treatment for a coral disease in the sea. We posit that phage therapy of certain coral diseases is achievable in situ.",2012,Coral Reefs
Chaotic Terrains on Mars: testing the subsurface lake hypothesis,"Terreni Caotici di Marte: verifica dell'ipotesi di lago sotterraneo.I Terreni Caotici di Marte rappresentano chilometriche depressioni topografiche caratterizzate da blocchi fratturati e tiltati. Molti catastrofici canali di flusso hanno come sorgenti tali Terreni Caotici. E' ormai largamente accettato che l'acqua sia implicata nella genesi di tali strutture, sebbene fin dal 1970 il suo ruolo rimane controverso. Le teorie spaziano dalla frantumazione idraulica della criosfera fino alla fusione indotta da processi magmatici. Recentemente una nuova ipotesi genetica ha posto l'attenzione sul possibile effetto di collasso indotto dallo scioglimento di ghiacci sotterranei presenti al di sotto di sedimenti. Tale ipotesi, se corretta, avrebbe elevate implicazioni nel decifrare la storia climatica di Marte. In questo contributo proponiamo la verifica di tea ipotesi utilizzando un approccio combinato di osservazioni geomorfologiche da immagini satellitari, modelli numerici e modelli analogici. Tale approccio permetterebbe di verificare l'effettiva validita' fisico-chimica di un modello di lago sotterraneo per la genesi dei Terreni Chaotici di Marte.",2012,Bollettino Della Societa Geologica Italiana
100th anniversary of the Fourth International Congress of Thalassotherapy in Opatija.,"The authors of the text have been particularly interested into the organization, the procedure,the accompanying activities as well as the themes covered at 4th International Congress of Thalassotherapy in Opatija in 1908. The Congress was organised by the then head of the thermal spa resort Professor Dr.Julius Glax. The official languages at the Congress were German, French, English, and also Italian and Croatian as the languages of the hosting country. Each lecturer had twenty minutes time to give a lecture or a co-lecture, ten minutes for papers and five for a follow-up discussion. The participants could make use of the information centre of the Congress, in the centre of Opatija, the whole day. Unofficially, the Congress started on 27th September 1908 with the introductory evening for all the participants in Adria Club. The Congress officially began on 28th September 1908 when all the participants gathered at the theatre hall of Hotel Stephanie. The lectures were presented in the morning. In the afternoon, the participants were taken to visit some exhibitions (e.g. the medical exhibition at Hotel Palace, the exhibition of the native Istrian-Dalmatian home crafts and antiquates and the painting exhibition at Vila Angiolina), a short sea voyage through the bay of Kvarner. On the last day of the Congress, the participants observed the sanitary conditions in Opatija (the water supply, the sewer system, litter incinerator, and quarantine for infectious illnesses), three sanatoriums, Zander's Institute, the rehabilitating-heart paths and the Archduke Ludwig-Viktor's indoor baths. The round-Opatija tour was followed by the concluding meeting and the conclusion of the Congress.

Molecular Predictors of Long-Term Survival in Glioblastoma Multiforme Patients,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and aggressive adult primary brain cancer, with <10% of patients surviving for more than 3 years. Demographic and clinical factors (e.g. age) and individual molecular biomarkers have been associated with prolonged survival in GBM patients. However, comprehensive systems-level analyses of molecular profiles associated with long-term survival (LTS) in GBM patients are still lacking. We present an integrative study of molecular data and clinical variables in these long-term survivors (LTSs, patients surviving >3 years) to identify biomarkers associated with prolonged survival, and to assess the possible similarity of molecular characteristics between LGG and LTS GBM. We analyzed the relationship between multivariable molecular data and LTS in GBM patients from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), including germline and somatic point mutation, gene expression, DNA methylation, copy number variation (CNV) and microRNA (miRNA) expression using logistic regression models. The molecular relationship between GBM LTS and LGG tumors was examined through cluster analysis. We identified 13, 94, 43, 29, and 1 significant predictors of LTS using Lasso logistic regression from the somatic point mutation, gene expression, DNA methylation, CNV, and miRNA expression data sets, respectively. Individually, DNA methylation provided the best prediction performance (AUC = 0.84). Combining multiple classes of molecular data into joint regression models did not improve prediction accuracy, but did identify additional genes that were not significantly predictive in individual models. PCA and clustering analyses showed that GBM LTS typically had gene expression profiles similar to non-LTS GBM. Furthermore, cluster analysis did not identify a close affinity between LTS GBM and LGG, nor did we find a significant association between LTS and secondary GBM. The absence of unique LTS profiles and the lack of similarity between LTS GBM and LGG, indicates that there are multiple genetic and epigenetic pathways to LTS in GBM patients.",2016,PLoS ONE
Partial Left-Looking Structured Multifrontal Factorization & Algorithms for Compressed Sensing,"Author(s): Wu, Cinna Julie | Advisor(s): Gu, Ming | Abstract: In this dissertation, we explore two problems involving large matrix computations. In the first half, we study the fast factorization of a large, sparse symmetric positive definite matrix and explain the underlying structures of the intermediate steps in the computation. Using these underlying structures, we present a new algorithm which takes advantage of these structures to reduce computational and memory costs. Our new algorithm is an improvement upon the well known and commonly used multifrontal method. We incorporate the use of fast structured computations to improve the algorithm as in [95, 92, 99].In the second part of the dissertation, we explore a new algorithm for solving minimization problems of the formmin |Ax - b| s.t. |x| 1 â‰¤ Ï„,where A is a wide matrix. This problem is often referred to in some fields as the Lasso problem. We improve upon an existing method by making a simple modification. Then we prove that this method is locally linearly convergent under certain reasonable conditions.",2012,
The Process and Pitfalls of Developing a Culturally Relevant Curriculum To Reduce AIDS among Sexually Active Teenagers: The Take 5 Project.,"Several studies have shown that adolescents have reasonably high levels of knowledge about Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) transmission and prevention, yet they still engage in risky sexual activities. In response to this dilemma, a theoretically and empirically grounded intervention which went beyond presenting facts and figures was developed and tested. The curriculum provides basic information about AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), but it also attempts to counter negative beliefs about condom use, reinforce positive ones, and includes skills training for discussing and negotiating condom use with a partner. The materials are intended for hetereosexually active adolescents at high risk of contracting AIDS and other STDs. The curriculum was based on the theory of reasoned action and social learning and cognition theories. The curriculum consists of three components: a comic book which presents basic information; a videotape in which teenage actors model skills for negotiating condom use with a partner; and a group skills training in which skills are modeled by peer facilitators and where participants engage in role playing and receive feedback on their performances. The skills training curriculum is intended for small groups from 6 to 12 adolescents and is led by an adult and two peer facilitators. The curriculum was designed to be appropriate for African American and white hetereosexually active adolescents. Reactions from the earliest study participants have been uniformly positive.

P 4CKGROUND Although the incidence of AIDS among adolescents is still quite low, there is reason to believe that adolescents are at risk (Brooks-Gunn, Boyer & Hein, 1988). First, owing to the long incubation period for AIDS, many young adults with AIDS may have been infected as teenagers (Curran, et al., 1988). Second, the rate of new AIDS cases in the adolescent population has been doubling every fourteen months (Kipke & Hein, 1990). Third, rates of several other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) have been rising in the adolescent population and rates of premarital pregnancy in this population remain high (Cates, 1990; Hein, 1988). Although condom use among adolescent males appears to have increased (Sonenstein, Pleck, & Ku, 1988), the findings above and data from several studies suggest that the majority of sexwily active adolescents do not consistently take precautions to avoid contracting the AIDS virus. It is unlikely that adolescents continue to engage in risky sexual behaviors solely out of ignorance. Several studies have shown that adolescents have reasonably high levels of knowledge about AIDS transmission and prevention, yet adolescents still engage in risky sexual activities (DiClemente et al, 1991; Hingston, Strunin, & Berlin, 1990; DiClemente, Boyer, & Morales, 1988; Kirby, 1985). This is not to suggest that providing information is unimportant; accurate knowledge about transmission and prevention of communicable diseases is clearly a necessary step toward behavior change. However, providing information alone is not likely to be sufficient to change behavior. In response to this dilemma, we sought to develop and test a theoretically and empirically grounded intervention which goes beyond presenting facts and figures. The curriculum we developed does provide basic information about AIDS and other STDs, but it also attempts to counter negative beliefs about condom use, reinforce positive ones, and includes skills training for discussing and negotiating condom use 2",1992,
"Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship Modeling of Juvenile Hormone Mimetic Compounds for Culex Pipiens Larvae, with a Discussion of Descriptor-Thinning Methods","Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modelers often encounter the problem of multicollinearity owing to the availability of large numbers of computable molecular descriptors. Sparsity of the variables while using descriptors such as atom pairs increases the complexity. Three different predictor-thinning methods, namely, a modified Gram-Schmidt algorithm, a marginal soft thresholding algorithm, and LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator), were utilized to reduce the number of descriptors prior to developing linear models. Juvenile hormone (JH) activity of 304 compounds on Culex pipiens larvae was taken as the model data set, and predictor trimming of a large number of diverse descriptors comprising 268 global molecular descriptors (topostructural, topochemical, and geometrical), 13 quantum chemical descriptors, and 915 atom pairs (substructural counts) was applied prior to linear regression by the ridge regression method. The data set (N = 304) was split into five calibration data sets of random samples of sizes 60/110/160/210/260, and the remaining 244/194/144/94/44 compounds were used for validations. LASSO was not found to be a very effective method in handling a large set of descriptors because the number of predictors retained could not exceed the number of observations. The results indicated that the modified Gram-Schmidt algorithm could be used to trim the number of predictors in the global molecular descriptor set where collinearity of the descriptors was the major concern. On the contrary, the soft thresholding approach was found to be an effective tool in subset selection from a diverse set of descriptors having both sparsity and multicollinearity, as in the case of the combined set of atom pairs and global molecular descriptors. The final model developed after variable selection was dominated more by atom pairs, which indicated the important structural moieties that affect JH activity of the compounds. The success of the method reiterates the fact that QSAR or quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) models can be developed for a diverse set of compounds using properly parametrized and diverse sets of descriptors, of course, with the selection of the appropriate statistical tools.",2006,Journal of chemical information and modeling
Inferring metabolic networks using the Bayesian adaptive graphical lasso with informative priors.,"Metabolic processes are essential for cellular function and survival. We are interested in inferring a metabolic network in activated microglia, a major neuroimmune cell in the brain responsible for the neuroinflammation associated with neurological diseases, based on a set of quantified metabolites. To achieve this, we apply the Bayesian adaptive graphical lasso with informative priors that incorporate known relationships between covariates. To encourage sparsity, the Bayesian graphical lasso places double exponential priors on the off-diagonal entries of the precision matrix. The Bayesian adaptive graphical lasso allows each double exponential prior to have a unique shrinkage parameter. These shrinkage parameters share a common gamma hyperprior. We extend this model to create an informative prior structure by formulating tailored hyperpriors on the shrinkage parameters. By choosing parameter values for each hyperprior that shift probability mass toward zero for nodes that are close together in a reference network, we encourage edges between covariates with known relationships. This approach can improve the reliability of network inference when the sample size is small relative to the number of parameters to be estimated. When applied to the data on activated microglia, the inferred network includes both known relationships and associations of potential interest for further investigation.",2013,Statistics and its interface
Vector Approximate Message Passing Algorithm for Structured Perturbed Sensing Matrix,"In this paper, we consider a general form of noisy compressive sensing (CS) where the sensing matrix is not precisely known. Such cases exist when there are imperfections or unknown calibration parameters during the measurement process. Particularly, the sensing matrix may have some structure, which makes the perturbation follow a fixed pattern. While previous work has focused on extending the approximate message passing (AMP) and LASSO algorithm to deal with the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) perturbation, we propose the robust variant vector approximate message passing (VAMP) algorithm with the perturbation being structured, based on the recent VAMP algorithm. The performance of the robust version of VAMP is demonstrated numerically.",2018,arXiv: Signal Processing

"Multitask Lasso Model for Investigating Multimodule Design Factors, Operational Factors, and Covariates in Tubular Microbial Fuel Cells","Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are a promising technology for simultaneous wastewater treatment and direct electricity generation. To build an effective large-scale MFC in field operation, it is important to identify the critical design and operational factors. However, there are limited studies that focus on developing systematic models to predict MFC performance and conduct variable selection. Herein, a multitask Lasso model (MLM) was employed to characterize the relationship among the input variables (design factors, operational factors, and covariates) and the output variables (normalized energy recovery (NER) and organic removal efficiency) of a tubular MFC with five modules. The proposed MLM can not only select the important input variables to predict the MFC performance but also simultaneously and accurately predict multiple output variables.

Learning spatial prior with automatically labeled landmarks,"We propose a method of automatically labeling landmarks on target images, which are used for training a constellation model to recognize general object class. First, we randomly sample local features (parts) and generate hierarchical representations of images in a similar way to the Â¿standard modelÂ¿ of visual cortex. Second, we pick out a unique location of each part among those local maxima in S2 layers by a matching procedure. Third, we model the spatial relations among parts as a sparse GMRF (Gaussian Markov random fields) graph, and learn the links by a lasso-based approach. Object localization in new images proceeds by maximizing the posterior of an object observed at a particular configuration. Our model is a thoroughly automatic scheme to perform Â¿feature bindingÂ¿. Experimental results on the CalTech101 database demonstrate that the proposed algorithm locates the components more precisely and outperforms the Â¿standard modelÂ¿ in object detection.",2008,2008 3rd International Conference on Intelligent System and Knowledge Engineering
Lasso procedure to revise overcorrection with radial keratotomy.,"PURPOSE
To report three patients who underwent the lasso procedure to revise overcorrection with radial keratotomy.


METHODS
Case report and review of the literature.


RESULTS
Four eyes of three patients who had undergone radial keratotomy with resultant hyperopic overcorrection underwent a lasso procedure. Before the procedure, average cycloplegic refraction spherical equivalent was +3.656 +/- 1.352 diopters, and average manifest refraction spherical equivalent was +2.250 +/- 0.621 diopters. A 10.0 monofilament nylon suture was placed in a circumferencial manner through the corneal stroma and overlapping the old radial keratotomy incisions. At 1 month postoperatively, best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 in all four eyes, with average cycloplegic refraction spherical equivalent +0.438 +/- 1.423 diopters and average manifest refraction spherical equivalent -0.156 +/- 1.147 diopters. Mean delta cycloplegic refraction spherical equivalent was 3.219 +/- 1.724.


CONCLUSIONS
The lasso procedure provides an immediate solution for symptomatic overcorrected hyperopic eyes after radial keratotomy. Predictability and long-term stability necessitate further follow-up.",1998,American journal of ophthalmology
A link-free sparse group variable selection method for single-index model,"ABSTRACT For regression problems with grouped covariates, we adapt the idea of sparse group lasso (SGL) [10] to the framework of the sufficient dimension reduction. Assuming that the regression falls into a single-index structure, we propose a method called the sparse group sufficient dimension reduction to conduct group and within-group variable selections simultaneously without assuming a specific link function. Simulation studies show that our method is comparable to the SGL under the regular linear model setting and outperforms SGL with higher true positive rates and substantially lower false positive rates when the regression function is nonlinear. One immediate application of our method is to the gene pathway data analysis where genes naturally fall into groups (pathways). An analysis of a glioblastoma microarray data is included for illustration of our method.",2017,Journal of Applied Statistics

The sensing system is capable of locating and quantifying up to three loads simultaneously applied to a metallic plate divided into 16 regions. The signal reconstruction is performed using compressive sensing methods to infer the spatial distribution of the applied forces. A comparison between the implemented method based on DE and traditional sparse signal recovery schemes (LASSO, OMP, Robust-SL0, and CoSaMP) showed the better performance of the proposed algorithm in the demonstrated application.",2017,IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement

Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome : Relationships between Severity and Sex,"Background: Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a pathological condition characterized by frequent episodes of collapse of the structures of the upper airways with interruption of airflow and reduction of oxygen saturation in arterial blood. Its incidence is equal to about 4% in men and 2% in females in the population up to 65 years of age. The severity of OSAS is determined by an index that relates the number of apneic events per hour of sleep ""apneahypopnea index"" (in English AHI: apnea-hypopnea index). As the muscle tone of the body ordinarily relaxes during sleep, and the airway at the throat is composed of walls of soft tissue, which can collapse, it is not surprising that breathing can be obstructed during sleep. Common signs of OSA are unexplained daytime sleepiness, restless sleep, and loud snoring (with periods of silence followed by gasps). Less common symptoms are morning headaches, insomnia, trouble concentrating, mood changes such as irritability, anxiety and depression, forgetfulness, increased heart rate and/or blood pressure, decreased sex Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome: relationships between severity and sex www.preventionandresearch.com 367 Oct-Dec 2012|P&R Scientific|Volume 2|NÂ°4 drive, unexplained weight gain, increased urination and/or nocturia, frequent heartburn or gastroesophageal reflux disease, and heavy night sweats. The gold standard for the diagnosis of OSAS is considered the polysomnography. Objectives: The aim of our study is to evaluate the influence of sex in the presentation of the disease. Methods: The sample was undergone to a visit for the evaluation of any anatomical abnormalities of the first airways, which can cause or aggravate the disease. Patients was subjected to a questionnaire for the evaluation of disorders which achieve to disease with the compilation of the Epworth evaluation scale, which measure the frequency with which the patient tends to fall asleep during the daily activities. We utilized also the polysomnography for the diagnosis and staging of the disease. Results: The analysis of the results obtained allows us to observe that the ratio between the apnea/Hypopnea number for hour and sex is not statistically significant (p>0,05), despite the prevalence of OSAS is greater in males than in females, with a ratio of 3:1. Discussion and Conclusions: Our study has allowed us to observe that the frequency of submission of OSAS is greater in male than female with a ratio of 3:1, while the severity of the disease does not appear related to sex. Thus, our study confirms the existing data in the literature showing a ratio of 5:1 in the presentation of the disease in males than in females. Abstract Introduzione: La sindrome delle apnee ostruttive del sonno (OSAS) Ã¨ una condizione patologica caratterizzata da frequenti brevi episodi di collasso delle strutture delle vie aeree superiori durante il sonno, con conseguente interruzione del flusso aereo che comporta la riduzione della saturazione di ossigeno nel sangue arterioso. La severitÃ  dellâ€™ OSAS Ã¨ determinata da un indice che mette in relazione il numero di eventi di apnea per ora di sonno ""apnea-ipopnea"" (in inglese AHI: apnea-ipopnea). Dal momento che la muscolatura del corpo si rilassa normalmente durante il sonno, le prime vie aeree, composte da pareti di tessuto molle che puÃ² collassare, non Ã¨ sorprendente che la respirazione possa essere ostruita durante il sonno. Segni comuni di OSA sono: sonnolenza diurna, sonno agitato e forte russamento (con periodi di silenzio seguiti da rantoli). Sintomi meno comuni sono mal di testa, insonnia mattutina, difficoltÃ  di concentrazione, cambiamenti di umore come irritabilitÃ , ansia e depressione, perdita di memoria, aumento della frequenza cardiaca e/o della pressione sanguigna, diminuzione del desiderio sessuale, aumento di peso inspiegabile, aumento della minzione e/o nicturia, pirosi gastrica frequente o malattia da reflusso gastroesofageo, e sudorazioni notturne pesanti. Il gold standard per la diagnosi di OSAS Ã¨ considerata la polisonnografia. Obiettivi: Lo scopo del nostro studio Ã¨ la valutazione della prevalenza di uno dei due sessi nello sviluppo e nella gravitÃ  di presentazione della patologia. Metodi: Abbiamo sottoposto il campione ad esame obiettivo per evidenziare la presenza di eventuali anomalie anatomiche che potessero causare o aggravare la patologia. Infine, Ã¨ stata utilizzata la polisonnografia per la diagnosi e stadiazione della patologia. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome: relationships between severity and sex www.preventionandresearch.com 368 Oct-Dec 2012|P&R Scientific|Volume 2|NÂ°4 Risultati: Lâ€™analisi dei risultati ottenuti ha permesso di osservare che il rapporto tra numero di apnee/ipopnee per ora di sonno ed il sesso non Ã¨ statisticamente significativo (p>0,05), nonostante la prevalenza dellâ€™OSAS nel sesso maschile sia maggiore che nel sesso femminile, con un rapporto di 3:1. Discussione e Conclusioni: Il nostro studio ha permesso di osservare che la frequenza di presentazione dellâ€™OSAS Ã¨ maggiore nel sesso maschile rispetto a quello femminile con un rapporto di 3:1, mentre la gravitÃ  della patologia non appare correlata al sesso. Quindi, la nostra ricerca conferma i dati giÃ  presenti in letteratura che mostrano un rapporto di 5:1 nella presentazione della patologia nei maschi rispetto alle femmine. Background The obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is characterized by episodes of partial obstruction (hypopnea) or complete (apnea) of the upper airway. Its incidence is equal to about 4% in men and 2% in females in the population up to 65 years of age (1, 2). The severity of OSA is determined by an index that relates the number of apneic events per hour of sleep ""apnea-hypopnea index"" (in English AHI: apnea-hypopnea index). A value of AHI of less than 5 is considered normal. A value between 5 and 15 classifies the OSAS in a mild form, a value between 15-30 defines the moderate and a value greater than 30 characterizes the severe sleep apnea (3, 4). The gold standard for the diagnosis of OSAS is considered the polysomnography (5, 6). Objectives The aim of our study was to evaluate the prevalence of one of the two sexes in the development and severity of presentation of Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome. Methods The study has been developed at the Complex Operative Unit of Phoniatrics of the Policlinico Umberto I in Roma. We enrolled 193 patient, 57 female and 136 male, aged between 21 and 77 years from September 2010 to July 2011. It was carried out a careful history that concern accessories disorders associated to OSAS. Sample was undergone to a visit for the evaluation of any anatomical abnormalities of the first airways, which can cause or aggravate the disease. Patients was subjected to a questionnaire for the evaluation of disorders which achieve to disease with the compilation of the Epworth evaluation scale, which measure the frequency with which the patient tends to fall asleep during the daily activities. Sample was divided into two groups according to sex. Each group, then, was further divided into four groups according to age. All patients were submitted to nocturnal polysomnographic home examination by Embletta Â® X100 for the identification and quantification of episodes of apnea/Hypopnea during sleep and elaboration of the AHI (Apnea/Hypopnea Index). In male patients, the mean AHI was 31.8 (range 18.2 to 45.5), while in females is 30.05 (range 14.3 to 41,8). Statistical Analysis To evaluate the correlation between AHI, sex and age was conducted a Ï‡ analysis. Results Statistical analysis of data of the ratio between AHI, age and sex is not statistically significant (p>0,05). The average AHI estimated for age group does not differ significantly from average AHI estimated for sex. OSAS is present in male of all ages with a peak of more frequent between 40 and 70 years; in females is present only after 40 years, with a peak between 55 and 70 years (Graphic 1, 2).",2012,
"A new uppermost Albian flora from Teruel province, northeastern Spain","ABSTRACT This paper reports a new Early Cretaceous flora discovered recently near the village of Estercuel (Teruel province, northeastern Spain). The plant bearing beds belong to the uppermost part of the Early Cretaceous succession, at the top of the fluvial deposits of the Utrillas Formation. The site has yielded a diverse assemblage of plant compressions including lycopods and ferns, various gymnosperms as well as terrestrial and aquatic angiosperms. Leaves of aquatic lycopods (Isoetites sp.) constitute a minor component of the palaeobotanical assemblage. Filicales are not very common, with Dicksoniales (Onychiopsis sp.) and a few specimens of Cladophlebis type fronds. The gymnosperms are represented by fragmented remains of long parallel veined Desmiophyllum leaves as well as a great abundance of conifer axis corresponding to the form-genus Pagiophyllum and female cones. Terrestrial angiosperms include pinnately lobed leaves of the genus Myricompia, simple leaves with spatulate lamina and some petiolate leaves both corresponding to angiosperms of uncertain affinity. Aquatic angiosperms consist of Nelumbo-like floral receptacles (Nelumbonaceae, Proteales) and Aquatifolia cf. fluitans (Nympheales). The palynological assemblage is dominated by pollen of gymnosperms (mainly Taxodiaceaepollenites hiatus, Classopollis major and Araucariacites australis). It also includes many angiosperm grains (Afropollis jardinus, Clavatipollenites spp., Dichastopollenites spp., Liliacidites doylei, Monosulcites chaloneri, Penetetrapites mollis, Pennipollis spp., Phimopollenites augathellaensis, Retimonocolpites textus, Rousea spp., Senectotetradites varireticulatus, Stellatopollis barghoornii, Striatopollis spp., Transitoripollis sp. cf. T. similis, Tricolpites spp., Tricolporoidites sp.) and records the first occurrence of tricolporate forms in the uppermost part of the Utrillas Formation. Both macroflora and microflora assemblages present taxa similar to those of the uppermost Albian Shaftesbury Formation in northwestern Alberta in Canada, the uppermost Albian Denton Shale Member of Bokchito Formation in southern Oklahoma, the lower part of the Upper Albian Dakota Formation from the mid-west of North America, and Subzone II C of the Potomac Group, eastern United States. Both macro- and microflora assemblages display boreal influence with some similar taxa to those of the Upper Albian Kome Formation in western Greenland and some taxa as Afropollis jardinus and Stellatopollis barghoornii more frequently found in the tethyan and gondwanan realms. A gondwanan affinity is also indicated by the presence of Klitzschophyllites leaves.",2012,
Confidence intervals in high-dimensional regression based on regularized pseudoinverses,"In modern data sets, the number of available variables can greatly exceed the number of observations. In this paper we show how valid confidence intervals can be constructed by approximating the inverse covariance matrix by a scaled Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse, and using the lasso to perform a bias correction. In addition, we propose random least squares, a new regularization technique which yields narrower confidence intervals with the same theoretical validity. Random least squares estimates the inverse covariance matrix using multiple low-dimensional random projections of the data. This is shown to be equivalent to a generalized form of ridge regularization. The methods are illustrated in Monte Carlo experiments and an empirical example using quarterly data from the FRED-QD database, where gross domestic product is explained by a large number of macroeconomic and financial indicators.",2017,arXiv: Statistics Theory

Catheter-based ablation of atrial fibrillation: a brief overview.,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia.1,2 It can be classified into 4 types: first detected episode; paroxysmal AF (PAF), which is self-terminating; persistent AF, in which an episode lasts more than 7 days and requires cardioversion to terminate; and permanent AF, which is continuous AF for which cardioversion has failed or has not been attempted.3 There are various options for the treatment of AF, including pharmacologic therapy and invasive electrophysiologic interventions.4 Catheter-based radiofrequency ablation is an effective treatment for AF, and it can be used instead of or in combination with antiarrhythmic medications.5 
 
Ectopic focal activity and reentry is the predominant model of the pathogenesis of AF.6 According to this model, AF originates from a rapidly firing focus in one of the atria, which maintains the AF through short reentrant circuits and causes spiraling (fibrillatory) conduction. Most triggers for AF are located in the pulmonary veins (PVs).7 Less commonly, triggers arise in other areas, such as the posterior wall of the left atrium, the musculature of the coronary sinus, the crista terminalis, the ligaments of Marshal, and the superior and inferior venae cavae.6 Lee and colleagues8 showed that, of 293 patients with ectopic beats that initiated PAF, 199 (68%) had pure PV ectopic beats, 36 (12%) had pure non-PV ectopic beats, and 58 (20%) had both PV and non-PV ectopic beats that caused PAF. 
 
Maintenance of sinus rhythm is the main goal of AF treatment. Antiarrhythmic drug therapy is the first-line treatment in patients with PAF and persistent AF. Because drugs have limited efficacy and are not free of adverse cardiac and systemic side effects, there is a persistent need to develop and improve drugs, devices, and ablative approaches for the treatment of AF. 
 
Recent findings in regard to the mechanisms of AF have resulted in extraordinary progress in various nonpharmacologic methods for eliminating AF triggers. In 1991, Cox and colleagues9 opened a new door in the management of AF by introducing a surgical techniqueâ€”the creation of an electrical maze in the atrium that was feasible as a surgical cure for human AF. Subsequently, other surgical techniques were developed to treat AF. All of these necessitated a thoracotomy and cardiopulmonary bypass, both of which increase the risk of sequelae. A desire to avoid these risks led to the development of alternative procedures, including catheter ablation. 
 
Since the first description of PVs as triggers of AF was published in 1998 by Haissaguerre and colleagues,10 the technique of using catheter ablation to eliminate these triggers has undergone multiple modifications. Approaches to catheter ablation include PV isolation (PVI), complex fractionated atrial electrogram ablation, autonomic ganglionated plexi ablation, atrial compartmentalization via linear lesions, and sequential ablation. 
 
In 2003, Pappone and coworkers11 compared 589 patients who underwent PVI with 582 patients who received antiarrhythmic medication for sinus-rhythm control. The investigators found that PVI reduced death and morbidity and improved quality of life, compared with medication. Then, in 2004, Chen and colleagues12 released the results of their study of PVI in 377 patients, 94 of whom had impaired LV function, and proposed that PVI might be a feasible therapeutic option in AF patients with impaired ejection fraction. That same year, Ouyang and coworkers13 reported their experience, in 41 patients, in creating continuous circular lesions with the double-Lasso technique, guided by 3D mapping. This technique had 95% efficacy at 6-month follow-up. 
 
In 2010, Wilber and colleagues14 performed a randomized controlled trial involving 167 patients at 19 hospitals, in order to compare the success rates of antiarrhythmic drug therapy and radiofrequency catheter ablation in patients with PAF. The success rate was 66% in the ablation group, compared with 16% in the antiarrhythmic group. That trial was the basis of the United States Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) first approval of a catheter for the treatment of PAF. 
 
Isolation of the PVs is the cornerstone of any ablation approach, and, in most trials of catheter ablation for AF, PVI has been used as an endpoint for the ablation procedure. Regardless of the technique used (Lasso, double Lasso, intracardiac echocardiogram-guided, or wide-area circumferential ablation), the goal should be the ablation of a large area of the atrium to eliminate all PV potentials. Ablation procedures are usually guided by 3D electroanatomic mapping systems, which facilitate the procedure by providing accurate visualization of the atrial anatomy and shortening the fluoroscopic time required. 
 
Studies have examined the adverse sequelae of catheter PV ablation. Bertaglia and coworkers15 prospectively evaluated the incidence of early complication at 10 Italian centers at which 1,011 patients underwent radiofrequency ablation for every type of AF. Complications occurred in 40 patients (3.9%), including 4 (0.4%) who had PV stenosis of more than 50%. In 2011, Baman and colleagues16 published a retrospective review of data obtained from 1,295 patients who had undergone radiofrequency ablation for PAF (53%) or persistent AF (47%). The rate of complications was 3.5% (50/1,295), and PV stenosis occurred in only 1 patient (< 0.01%). 
 
In the years since PVI was introduced, PV stenosis has decreased in frequency, primarily because ablation techniques are now precise enough to avoid the PV ostium. One of the new tools used to increase the precision of ablation procedures is the irrigated-tip magnetic catheter. This catheter is steerable by a magnetic field, which enables the operator to move the catheter in different directions with an external remote control. In addition, the irrigated tip reduces procedure time and prevents charring, enabling this catheter to induce larger, deeper, and more effective lesions than a nonirrigated magnetic catheter.17,18 Pappone and colleagues,19 who monitored 130 patients (81 with PAF and 49 with persistent AF) for 15.3 Â± 4.9 months after PVI with the irrigated-tip magnetic catheter, found success rates of 81.4% in patients with PAF and 67.3% in patients with persistent AF. No PV stenosis, tamponade, or stroke was observed. 
 
Another ablation catheter, which was recently approved by the FDA, is the Arctic FrontÂ® Cardiac CryoAblation Catheter (Medtronic, Inc.; Minneapolis, Minn). Numerous studies of the device have been performed in Europe. Neumann,20 Van Belle,21 Kojodjojo,22 and their colleagues conducted prospective studies that enrolled 293, 141, and 90 AF patients, respectively, all of whom underwent PV cryoablation with the Arctic Front catheter. The studies showed respective short-term success rates of 97%, 98.5%, and 83% of patients. After 1 year, 74%, 73%, and 77% of enrolled patients, respectively, were free of AF. 
 
The STOP-AF trial23 was the basis for the approval of the Arctic Front catheter in the United States. This trial, which was the first randomized study of cryoablation versus antiarrhythmic drugs to be conducted in the United States, involved 245 patients with PAF. Effectiveness was defined for cryoablation patients as both short-term procedural success and freedom from long-term treatment failure, which meant no detectable AF after the blanking period, no use of non-study drugs to treat AF, and no additional intervention for AF. One year after treatment, 69.9% of patients treated with cryoablation had achieved the primary endpoint of freedom from AF, compared with only 7.3% of patients treated with AF drugs. 
 
The approach to ablative therapy for AF should be tailored to each case. Multiple variables should be considered, including the type of AF (paroxysmal, persistent, or chronic), the duration of chronic AF, the presence of concomitant valvular heart disease, and the size of the left atrium. In patients with PAF or persistent AF, catheter-based ablation therapy has produced promising results, including shorter length of stay, decreased morbidity, and success rates similar to those of surgical approaches.",2011,Texas Heart Institute journal
Regression analysis of locality preserving projections via sparse penalty,"Recent studies have shown that linear subspace algorithms, such as Principal Component Analysis, Linear Discriminant Analysis and Locality Preserving Projections, have attracted tremendous attention in many fields of information processing. However, the projection results obtained by these algorithms are linear combination of the original features, which is difficult to be interpreted psychologically and physiologically. Motivated by Compressive Sensing theory, we formulate the generalized eigenvalue problem under CS framework, which then allows us to apply a sparsity penalty and minimization procedure to locality preserving projections. The proposed algorithm is called sparse locality preserving projections, which performs locality preserving projections in the lasso regression framework that dimensionality reduction, feature selection and classification are merged into one analysis. The method is also extended to its regularized form to improve its generalization. The proposed algorithm is a combination of locality preserving with sparse penalty. Additionally, the algorithm can be performed in either supervised or unsupervised tasks. Experimental results on toy and real data sets show that our methods are effective and demonstrate much higher performance.",2015,Inf. Sci.
Empirical Bayes conditional independence graphs for regulatory network recovery,"MOTIVATION
Computational inference methods that make use of graphical models to extract regulatory networks from gene expression data can have difficulty reconstructing dense regions of a network, a consequence of both computational complexity and unreliable parameter estimation when sample size is small. As a result, identification of hub genes is of special difficulty for these methods.


METHODS
We present a new algorithm, Empirical Light Mutual Min (ELMM), for large network reconstruction that has properties well suited for recovery of graphs with high-degree nodes. ELMM reconstructs the undirected graph of a regulatory network using empirical Bayes conditional independence testing with a heuristic relaxation of independence constraints in dense areas of the graph. This relaxation allows only one gene of a pair with a putative relation to be aware of the network connection, an approach that is aimed at easing multiple testing problems associated with recovering densely connected structures.


RESULTS
Using in silico data, we show that ELMM has better performance than commonly used network inference algorithms including GeneNet, ARACNE, FOCI, GENIE3 and GLASSO. We also apply ELMM to reconstruct a network among 5492 genes expressed in human lung airway epithelium of healthy non-smokers, healthy smokers and individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease assayed using microarrays. The analysis identifies dense sub-networks that are consistent with known regulatory relationships in the lung airway and also suggests novel hub regulatory relationships among a number of genes that play roles in oxidative stress and secretion.

On the inconsistency of â„“1-penalised sparse precision matrix estimation,"BackgroundVarious â„“1-penalised estimation methods such as graphical lasso and CLIME are widely used for sparse precision matrix estimation and learning of undirected network structure from data. Many of these methods have been shown to be consistent under various quantitative assumptions about the underlying true covariance matrix. Intuitively, these conditions are related to situations where the penalty term will dominate the optimisation.ResultsWe explore the consistency of â„“1-based methods for a class of bipartite graphs motivated by the structure of models commonly used for gene regulatory networks. We show that all â„“1-based methods fail dramatically for models with nearly linear dependencies between the variables. We also study the consistency on models derived from real gene expression data and note that the assumptions needed for consistency never hold even for modest sized gene networks and â„“1-based methods also become unreliable in practice for larger networks.ConclusionsOur results demonstrate that â„“1-penalised undirected network structure learning methods are unable to reliably learn many sparse bipartite graph structures, which arise often in gene expression data.

Koe tehtiin cyclic change-over koejarjestelynmukaan kayttamalla 24 ay-lehmaa. Kokeessa oli nelja 21 pv:n pituista koejaksoa. Kuusi koeruokintaa jarjestettiin 2 x 3 faktoriaalisesti ja koostuivat kasittelemattomasta (UB) ja kasitellysta ohrasta (TB), joita molempia annettiin joko ilman lisavalkuaista (kontrolli) tai joko kasittelemattoman tai fysikaalisesti suojauskasitellyn rypsin kanssa. Sailo-rehua lehmat saivat vapaasti ja vakirehua 10 kg/pv koko kokeen ajan. Rypsi korvasi 2 kg/pv perusvaki-rehusta, joka ohran lisaksi sisalsi melassoitua juurikasleiketta (200 g/kg). Ohran suojauskasittely vahensi merkitsevasti sailorehun syontia. Maitotuotokseen ohran kasittely ei vaikuttanut, mutta pienemman maidon rasvapitoisuuden vuoksi energiakorjattu maitotuotos vaheni. Ohran kasittely lisasi merkitsevasti maidon valkuaispitoisuutta, mutta ei vaikuttanut valkuaistuotokseen. Rypsi lisasi sailorehun syontia, maitotuotosta, maidon valkuaispitoisuutta seka kaikkien maidon komponenttien tuotosta.

The application of unsupervised deep learning in predictive models using electronic health records,"The main goal of this study is to explore the use of features representing patient-level electronic health record (EHR) data, generated by the unsupervised deep learning algorithm autoencoder, in predictive modeling. Since autoencoder features are unsupervised, this paper focuses on their general lower-dimensional representation of EHR information in a wide variety of predictive tasks. We compare the model with autoencoder features to traditional models: logistic model with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and Random Forest algorithm. In addition, we include a predictive model using a small subset of response-specific variables (Simple Reg) and a model combining these variables with features from autoencoder (Enhanced Reg). We performed the study first on simulated data that mimics real world EHR data and then on actual EHR data from eight Advocate hospitals. On simulated data with incorrect categories and missing data, the precision for autoencoder is 24.16% when fixing recall at 0.7, which is higher than Random Forest (23.61%) and lower than LASSO (25.32%). The precision is 20.92% in Simple Reg and improves to 24.89% in Enhanced Reg. When using real EHR data to predict the 30-day readmission rate, the precision of autoencoder is 19.04%, which again is higher than Random Forest (18.48%) and lower than LASSO (19.70%). The precisions for Simple Reg and Enhanced Reg are 18.70 and 19.69% respectively. That is, Enhanced Reg can have competitive prediction performance compared to LASSO. In addition, results show that Enhanced Reg usually relies on fewer features under the setting of simulations of this paper. We conclude that autoencoder can create useful features representing the entire space of EHR data and which are applicable to a wide array of predictive tasks. Together with important response-specific predictors, we can derive efficient and robust predictive models with less labor in data extraction and model training.",2020,BMC Medical Research Methodology
"Frenelopsis alata and its microsporangiate and ovuliferous reproductive structures from the Cenomanian of Bohemia (Czech Republic, Central Europe).","The conifer, Frenelopsis alata (K. Feistmantel) E. Knobloch (Cheirolepidiaceae), occurring mostly in the Cenomanian of Europe, is revised on the basis of the type material. Its comparison with relevant species of Frenelopsis is discussed.The ovuliferous cone associated with the genus Frenelopsis is recorded for the first time. For the associated ovuliferous cones of Frenelopsis, a new genus, Alvinia, is introduced in a new combination for the type: Alvinia bohemica (VelenovskÃ½) comb. n. Its association with Frenelopsis alata is based on the presence of Classopollis pollen adhering to ovuliferous cone scales, and the same type of pollen found in the microsporangiate cone of F. alata, the same cuticle pattern present on ovuliferous cones, sterile twigs and microsporangiate cones of F. alata, and also the co-occurrence of ovuliferous cones or their scales and sterile twigs of F. alata.Large ovuliferous cones of Alvinia bohemica are formed by helically arranged ovuliferous scales subtended by bracts. Each ovuliferous cone scale displays one or two seeds covered by a covering flap, and three appendages, which form distally a funnel-like structure lined in its inner part by long trichomes. Numerous pollen grains of Classopollis adhere to the trichomes, and the structure is considered to function as a protostigmatic area.The ovuliferous cones of Alvinia differ from similar cones of the Cheirolepidiaceae, Hirmeriella and Tomaxellia, mainly in a high state of unification of the ovuliferous cone scale, reduction of appendages and in a presence of the protostigmatic funnel-like structure.The ovuliferous cones, Alvinia bohemica, rarely occur intact, so it is assumed that they disintegrate when mature. It seems likely that they were not woody. This assumption is supported by the flattened appearance of cones and their cone scales in the sediment, their flexibility and the absence of massive coaly matter known from cones of the Taxodiaceae and Cupressaceae. It is proposed that this type of ovuliferous cone scale indicates a specialized type of pollination. In addition, it is suggested that cone scales enclosing seeds play an important role in propagation.",2000,Review of palaeobotany and palynology
Insights into the Unique Phosphorylation of the Lasso Peptide Paeninodin*,"Lasso peptides are a new class of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides and thus far are only isolated from proteo- and actinobacterial sources. Typically, lasso peptide biosynthetic gene clusters encode enzymes for biosynthesis and export but not for tailoring. Here, we describe the isolation of the novel lasso peptide paeninodin from the firmicute Paenibacillus dendritiformis C454 and reveal within its biosynthetic cluster a gene encoding a kinase, which we have characterized as a member of a new class of lasso peptide-tailoring kinases. By employing a wide variety of peptide substrates, it was shown that this novel type of kinase specifically phosphorylates the C-terminal serine residue while ignoring those located elsewhere. These experiments also reveal that no other recognition motif is needed for efficient enzymatic phosphorylation of the C-terminal serine. Furthermore, through comparison with homologous HPr kinases and subsequent mutational analysis, we confirmed the essential catalytic residues. Our study reveals how lasso peptides are chemically diversified and sets the foundation for rational engineering of these intriguing natural products.",2016,The Journal of Biological Chemistry
Successful removal from the esophagus of a self-expandable metal stent that had shriveled up into a tangled ball.,"A 39-year-old woman developed a leak from the cardia following a sleeve gastrectomy. She underwent placement of an 18-cm Niti-S covered esophageal self-expandable metal stent (SEMS; TaeWoong Medical, Gimpo, Korea) at the gastroesophageal junction (â—"" Fig.1a). The patient returned to undergo stent removal 4 weeks after its placement. During this procedure the lasso stitch at the distal endwas graspedwith endoscopic foreignbody forceps and was pulled (â—"" Fig.1b). The stent began to invaginate fromwithin but soon shrank into a tangled ball of metal wires (â—"" Fig.1c andâ—"" Fig.2). The distal lasso stitch slipped out of the forceps, leaving the now compacted SEMS lying in the mid-esophagus and completely obstructing the lumen. The SEMS was gradually eased away from the esophageal mucosa using the proximal lasso stitch. The disjointed mesh wires were slowly pulled off the mucosa, and thereby the whole of the stent was successfully removed under fluoroscopic guidance (â—"" Fig.3). Endoscopy confirmed the absence of any esophageal injury, but persistence of the original leak was noted. An over-the-scope clip (OTSC) was used to obliterate the leak (â—"" Fig.4). Fracture of an esophageal SEMS has been previously described, during positioning because of defectivematerial and as a consequence of laser therapy that caused a late spontaneous fracture during palliative treatment [1]. It appears that corrosion is the principal cause of fracture because, once in place and fully expanded, SEMS are not subject to any great mechanical Fig.1 Radiographic views showing: a the 18-cm covered self-expandable metal stent (SEMS) in position at the esophagogastric junction; b a foreign-body forceps being used to grasp the distal lasso stitch of the SEMS during its removal; c the SEMS shriveled up into a tangle of metal wire in the mid-esophagus.",2013,Endoscopy
Magnetic resonance imaging and molecular features associated with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in breast cancer,"BackgroundWe sought to investigate associations between dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in breast cancer, as well as to study if MRI features are complementary to molecular markers of TILs.MethodsIn this retrospective study, we extracted 17 computational DCE-MRI features to characterize tumor and parenchyma in The Cancer Genome Atlas cohort (nâ€‰=â€‰126). The percentage of stromal TILs was evaluated on H&E-stained histological whole-tumor sections. We first evaluated associations between individual imaging features and TILs. Multiple-hypothesis testing was corrected by the Benjamini-Hochberg method using false discovery rate (FDR). Second, we implemented LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) and linear regression nested with tenfold cross-validation to develop an imaging signature for TILs. Next, we built a composite prediction model for TILs by combining imaging signature with molecular features. Finally, we tested the prognostic significance of the TIL model in an independent cohort (I-SPY 1; nâ€‰=â€‰106).ResultsFour imaging features were significantly associated with TILs (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05 and FDRâ€‰<â€‰0.2), including tumor volume, cluster shade of signal enhancement ratio (SER), mean SER of tumor-surrounding background parenchymal enhancement (BPE), and proportion of BPE. Among molecular and clinicopathological factors, only cytolytic score was correlated with TILs (Ïâ€‰=â€‰0.51; 95% CI, 0.36â€“0.63; Pâ€‰=â€‰1.6E-9). An imaging signature that linearly combines five features showed correlation with TILs (Ïâ€‰=â€‰0.40; 95% CI, 0.24â€“0.54; Pâ€‰=â€‰4.2E-6). A composite model combining the imaging signature and cytolytic score improved correlation with TILs (Ïâ€‰=â€‰0.62; 95% CI, 0.50â€“0.72; Pâ€‰=â€‰9.7E-15). The composite model successfully distinguished low vs high, intermediate vs high, and low vs intermediate TIL groups, with AUCs of 0.94, 0.76, and 0.79, respectively. During validation (I-SPY 1), the predicted TILs from the imaging signature separated patients into two groups with distinct recurrence-free survival (RFS), with log-rank Pâ€‰=â€‰0.042 among triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). The composite model further improved stratification of patients with distinct RFS (log-rank Pâ€‰=â€‰0.0008), where TNBC with no/minimal TILs had a worse prognosis.ConclusionsSpecific MRI features of tumor and parenchyma are associated with TILs in breast cancer, and imaging may play an important role in the evaluation of TILs by providing key complementary information in equivocal cases or situations that are prone to sampling bias.",2018,Breast Cancer Research : BCR
Determinants of ICT infrastructure: A cross-country statistical analysis,"We investigate economic and institutional determinants of ICT infrastructure for a broad cross section ofmore than 100 countries. The ICT variable is constructed from a principal components analysis. The explanatory variables are selected by variants of the Lasso estimator from the machine learning literature.In addition to least squares, we also apply robust and semiparametric regression estimators. The results show that the regressions are able to explain ICT infrastructure very well. Major determinants identified are real income per capita, the availability of electricity, the extent of urbanization and indicators for the quality of the institutional environment. We also find evidence of conditional convergence of the ICT infrastructure across countries.",2016,
Le strutture Tensegrali e la loro applicazionein Architettura,"Lo studio di ricerca presentato ripercorre la storia e lâ€™evoluzione delle strutture tensegrali tracciando una linea nel tempo e sottolineando gli autori piu rilevanti, gli specialisti e le relative pubblicazioni non solo legati all'architettura ma anche ad altri settori che potrebbero fungere da guida.
Studia le origini delle strutture tensegrali, i brevetti originali e tende a far luce su alcuni aspetti circa la paternita di tale sistema strutturale innovativo; stabilisce una definizione chiara e generalmente accettata di strutture tensegrali elencando una classifica generale per questi sistemi; analizza l'utilizzo di strutture simili alle strutture tensegrali in precedenti studi, lavori o brevetti e le confronta con alcune delle proposte suggerite per attestarne la fattibilita.
Definisce altresi le caratteristiche strutturali ed i concetti fondamentali delle sollecitazioni di compressione/tensione e del problema di ricerca della forma, descrivendo le loro caratteristiche e mettendo in evidenza i vantaggi indicando al contempo criticita e punti deboli.
 Il progetto di ricerca tassonomica e incentrato sullo studio degli aspetti di natura costruttiva, strutturale, funzionale, tipologica e formale relativi alla progettazione ed alla sperimentazione di campo di sistemi tensegrali da applicare in architettura. E stato dimostrato, infatti, che una progettazione basata su tali sistemi tensegrali puo essere una valida proposta di architettura innovativa. Le strutture tensegrali sono innanzitutto molto leggere, sono modulari e possono essere applicate nel campo dellâ€™architettura stabile - permanente, trasformabile e/o transitoria. 
E stato dimostrato che le architetture tensegrali garantiscono la minima massa strutturale per una varieta di condizioni di carico, che includono strutture soggette a carichi eccentrici, di compressione, di trazione (sotto un dato vincolo di rigidezza), di torsione, e strutture semplicemente appoggiate (ad es. i ponti), senza collasso per compressione o per instabilita. Inoltre una speciale capacita delle architetture tensegrali consiste nellâ€™integrazione delle funzioni di controllo nel progetto delle strutture: nei sistemi tensegrali controllati la meccanica del controllo e la struttura possono naturalmente cooperare, attraverso il cambiamento della configurazione di equilibrio della struttura, in modo opposto a quanto avviene nel controllo tradizionale dove spesso la meccanica e la logica del controllo non interagisce facilmente con lâ€™equilibrio della struttura o addirittura andare in conflitto con lo stesso. In architettura le strutture sono generalmente progettate per soddisfare passivamente criteri quali la sicurezza, la stabilita e la facilita di manutenzione in modo che le costruzioni abbiano la resistenza necessaria per evitare il collasso e per assorbire le forze sismiche oltre a garantire lo svolgimento delle funzioni in modo soddisfacente. Oggi le tipologie costruttive nel panorama dellâ€™edilizia mondiale hanno un comportamento prevalentemente statico fatta eccezione di diversi ponti o coperture dinamiche, esempi in cui il movimento e limitato ad una sola direzione. Le tecnologie tensegrali vengono impiegate nella progettazione di strutture attive integrate con attuatori e sensori in un unico sistema di controllo. Quando i sensori rilevano un eventuale disturbo, il sistema di controllo utilizza attuatori per cambiare proprieta strutturali come la forma o la tensione dei cavi per ottenere il cinematismo ricercato. La struttura puo quindi continuare a soddisfare i criteri di sicurezza e facilita di manutenzione, rimanendo in tal modo operativa. Trasformazioni di forma sono comuni nelle strutture rimovibili, ovvero nei sistemi strutturali che variano la loro forma da una configurazione compatta ad una configurazione di servizio espansa. Tali sistemi di solito sono costituiti da moduli elementari che possono essere uniti per formare strutture piu complesse. Le strutture tensegrali dispiegabili attualmente hanno due principali campi di applicazione: lâ€™ingegneria civile e lâ€™ingegneria aerospaziale con applicazioni come ponti, rifugi temporanei, strutture morphing e riflettori pieghevoli o antenne. La progettazione di una struttura dispiegabile comprende compiti aggiuntivi e vincoli come la pianificazione di un percorso di ripiegamento in base alle forze agenti. Di conseguenza la sfida alla progettazione di strutture dispiegabili e dunque di sistemi tensegrali e chiaramente piu complessa di quella per le strutture tradizionali. Essi si identificano come sistemi vantaggiosi per applicazioni di controllo attivo di elementi strutturali ed elementi attivi che possono essere combinati. Anche se il concetto di strutture tensegrali e stato studiato in diverse discipline come lâ€™ingegneria aerospaziale, la biologia, la robotica, alcuni esempi di strutture tensegrali sono stati utilizzati per scopi legati al mondo delle costruzioni ed in particolare allâ€™architettura contemporanea.
Lâ€™obiettivo al quale punta la presente tesi di dottorato e quello di ottenere una maggiore consapevolezza tecnica e scinetifica e cercare di incoraggiare la scelta di sistemi strutturali tensegrali in architettura e ingegneria come applicazione fattibile per strutture di copertura sia per opere ex novo, sia di protezione del costruito storico ed antico.",2017,
Detecting Epistasis by LASSO-Penalized-Model Search Algorithm in Human Genome-Wide Association Studies,"Extensive studies have shown that many complex diseases are influenced by interaction of certain genes, while due to the limitations and drawbacks of adopting logistic regression (LR) to detect epistasis in human Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), we propose a new method named LASSO-penalized-model search algorithm (LPMA) by restricting it to a tuning constant and combining it with a penalization of the L1-norm of the complexity parameter, and it is implemented utilizing the idea of multi-step strategy. LASSO penalized regression particularly shows advantageous properties when the number of factors far exceeds the number of samples. We compare the performance of LPMA with its competitors. Through simulated data experiments, LPMA performs better regarding to the identification of epistasis and prediction accuracy.",2014,Advanced Materials Research
Simple one-pass algorithm for penalized linear regression with cross-validation on MapReduce,"In this paper, we propose a one-pass algorithm on MapReduce for penalized linear regression 
\[f_\lambda(\alpha, \beta) = \|Y - \alpha\mathbf{1} - X\beta\|_2^2 + p_{\lambda}(\beta)\] where $\alpha$ is the intercept which can be omitted depending on application; $\beta$ is the coefficients and $p_{\lambda}$ is the penalized function with penalizing parameter $\lambda$. $f_\lambda(\alpha, \beta)$ includes interesting classes such as Lasso, Ridge regression and Elastic-net. Compared to latest iterative distributed algorithms requiring multiple MapReduce jobs, our algorithm achieves huge performance improvement; moreover, our algorithm is exact compared to the approximate algorithms such as parallel stochastic gradient decent. Moreover, what our algorithm distinguishes with others is that it trains the model with cross validation to choose optimal $\lambda$ instead of user specified one.

Design of user interfaces for selective editing of digital photos on touchscreen devices,"When editing images it is often desirable to apply a filter with a spatially varying strength. With the usual selection tools like gradient, lasso, brush, or quick selection tools, creating masks containing such spatially varying strength values is time-consuming and cumbersome. We present an interactive filtering approach which allows to process photos selectively without the intermediate step of creating a mask containing strength values. In using this approach, the user only needs to place reference points (called control points) on the image and to adjust the spatial influence and filter strength for each control point. The filter is then applied selectively to the image, with strength values interpolated for each pixel between control points. The interpolation is based on a mixture of distances in space, luminance, and color; it is therefore a low-level operation. Since the main goal of the approach is to make selective image editing intuitive, easy, and playful, emphasis is put on the user interface: We describe the process of developing an existing mouse-driven user interface into a touch-driven one. Many question needed to be answered anew, such as how to present a slider widget on a touchscreen. Several variants are discussed and compared.",2013,
Load Nowcasting: Predicting Actuals with Limited Data,"We introduce the problem of load nowcasting to the energy forecasting literature. The recent load of the objective area is predicted based on limited available metering data within this area. Thus, slightly different from load forecasting, we are predicting the recent past using limited available metering data from the supply side of the system. Next, to an industry benchmark model, we introduce multiple high-dimensional models for providing more accurate predictions. They evaluate metered interconnector and generation unit data of different types like wind and solar power, storages, and nuclear and fossil power plants. Additionally, we augment the model by seasonal and autoregressive components to improve the nowcasting performance. We consider multiple estimation techniques based on the lassoand ridge and study the impact of the choice of the training/calibration period. The methodology is applied to a European TSO dataset from 2014 to 2019. The overall results show that in comparison to the industry benchmark, an accuracy improvement in terms of MAE and RMSE of about 60% is achieved. The best model is based on the ridge estimator and uses a specific non-standard shrinkage target. Due to the linear model structure, we can easily interpret the model output.",2020,Energies

Blame it on the Rain Weather Shocks and Retail Sales,"Failure to attribute retail sales variation to weather shocks can result in biased demand forecasts, misinterpretation of nancial indicators, and undue volatility in commission-based pay. I estimate retail sales responses to weather shocks using proprietary national daily store-level apparel and sporting goods sales data combined with a weather index. Developed using the lasso method, this index allows for seasonally and regionally heterogeneous nonlinear responses. The worst 5 percent of weather shocks decrease daily store sales by 20 percent. These losses are permanent with limited shifting of sales between indoor and outdoor malls and no substitution to e-commerce.",2016,
Stability and variability of personality networks. A tutorial on recent developments in network psychometrics,"Networks have been recently proposed for modeling dynamics in several kinds of psychological phenomena, such as personality and psychopathology. In this work, we introduce techniques that allow disentangling between-subject networks, which encode dynamics that involve stable individual differences, from within-subject networks, which encode dynamics that involve momentary levels of certain individual characteristics. Furthermore, we show how networks can be simultaneously estimated in separate groups of individuals, using a technique called the Fused Graphical Lasso. This technique allows also performing meaningful comparisons among groups. The unique properties of each kind of network are discussed. A tutorial to implement these techniques in the â€œRâ€ statistical software is presented, together with an example of application.",2017,Personality and Individual Differences
RZ Leonis Minoris bridging between ER Ursae Majoris-type dwarf nova and nova-like system,"We observed RZ LMi, which is renowned for the extremely (~19d) short supercycle and is a member of a small, unusual class of cataclysmic variables called ER UMa-type dwarf novae, in 2013 and 2016. In 2016, the supercycles of this object substantially lengthened in comparison to the previous measurements to 35, 32, 60d for three consecutive superoutbursts. We consider that the object virtually experienced a transition to the novalike state (permanent superhumper). This observed behavior extremely well reproduced the prediction of the thermal-tidal instability model. We detected a precursor in the 2016 superoutburst and detected growing (stage A) superhumps with a mean period of 0.0602(1)d in 2016 and in 2013. Combined with the period of superhumps immediately after the superoutburst, the mass ratio is not as small as in WZ Sge-type dwarf novae, having orbital periods similar to RZ LMi. By using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) two-dimensional power spectra, we detected possible negative superhumps with a period of 0.05710(1)d. We estimated the orbital period of 0.05792d, which suggests a mass ratio of 0.105(5). This relatively large mass ratio is even above ordinary SU UMa-type dwarf novae, and it is also possible that the exceptionally high mass-transfer rate in RZ LMi may be a result of a stripped core evolved secondary which are evolving toward an AM CVn-type object.",2016,Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan

Spore-Pollen Correlation of Cretaceous Rocks of Northern and Southern Hemispheres: ABSTRACT,"This paper summarizes published and unpublished palynological data from Upper Jurassic and Cretaceous sediments of northwest Europe, Russia, North and Central America, the Middle East, North and West Africa, South America, Australia, and New Zealand. Many publications could be considered only in a very general way or had to be disregarded because of the inadequate illustrations and descriptions of species and nomenclatural confusion or because of the complete lack of stratigraphic data. Numerous very distinctive forms of spores and pollen grains, some of which can be assigned with confidence to living families of plants, make their first appearance in the fossil record during Upper Jurassic and Cretaceous time. They are accompanied in the marine sediments by the incoming of equally distinctive forms of microplankton. Based mainly on the incoming of such forms of spores, pollen, and microplankton, many authors have erected varying numbers of palynological subdivisions for use purely in local correlation in their respective areas. Some, but unfortunately few, by comparison with spores, pollen, and microplankton from sections independently dated by other fossils such as ammonites or foraminifera, have attempted to correlate local palynological subdivisions with the stan ard biostratigraphic units of the Cretaceous. A compilation of results from published works, together with unpublished results from Royal Dutch/Shell Group palynologists, suggests the following generalized sequence of spore and pollen floras and their approximate correlation with the standard biostratigraphic units. Upper Cretaceous: Floras with increasing numbers of species of dicotyledonous pollen grains. Tendency toward typical Northern and Southern Hemisphere floras is apparent in the Lower Senonian and is clearly marked by the Upper Senonian. In most areas considered, a broad 3-fold palynological subdivision is apparent, which is correlated generally with the Cenomanian-Turonian, Lower Senonian, and Upper Senonian. Aptian-Albian: First appearance of generally small and more or less sculptureless tricolpate dicotyledonous pollen grains in both Hemispheres. Last appearance in most areas of the Northern Hemisphere of such typical Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous forms as Classopollis torosus, Caytonipollenites pallidus, Pilosisporites trichopapillosus. Hauterivian - Barremian: Northern Hemisphere floras generally characterized by co-occurrence of Jurassic and older Cretaceous forms of spores and pollen together with Ephedra-like pollen and rare monosulcate pollen grains with clearly differentiated exine (Clavatipollenites). Not sufficient data from Southern Hemisphere for comparison. Valanginian: In both Northern and Southern Hemispheres generally characterized by abundant specimens of Cicatricosisporites dorogensis and related forms together with abundant typical Jurassic gymnosperm and pteridosperm pollen. Clearly separated from Jurassic in Northern Hemisphere by first appearance of a number of forms including Appendicisporites. The paleontological and stratigraphic evidence used in the correlation of local palynological subdivisions with the biostratigraphic units within the areas considered, is summarized in the form of range charts, and some of the more distinctive species of spores and pollen are illustrated by photomicrographs.

A comparative study of variable selection procedures applied in high dimensional medical problems,"In health studies, many potential factors are usually introduced to determine an outcome variable. In our study, different statistical methods are applied to analyze trauma annual data, collected by 30 General Hospitals in Greece. The first dataset consists of 1681 observations and 76 factors and the second of 6334 observations and 131 factors, that include demographic, transport and intrahospital data. The statistical methods employed in this work were the nonconcave penalized likelihood methods, SCAD, LASSO, and Hard, the generalized linear logistic regression, and the best subset variable selection, used to detect possible risk factors of death. A variety of different statistical models are considered, with respect to the combinations of factors and the number of observations. A comparative survey reveals differences between results and execution times of each method, and the analysis produces models that identify the significant prognostic factors affecting death from trauma.",2008,

Thresholded Basis Pursuit: LP Algorithm for Order-Wise Optimal Support Recovery for Sparse and Approximately Sparse Signals From Noisy Random Measurements,"In this paper, we present a linear programming solution for sign pattern recovery of a sparse signal, x, from noisy random projections of the signal. We consider two types of noise models: input noise, where noise enters before the random projection, and output noise, where noise enters after the random projection. Sign pattern recovery involves the estimation of sign pattern of a sparse signal. Our idea is to pretend that no noise exists and solve the noiseless â„“1 problem, namely, min ||Î²||1 s.t. y - GÎ² and quantizing the resulting solution. We show that the quantized solution perfectly reconstructs the sign pattern of a sufficiently sparse signal. Specifically, we show that the sign pattern of an arbitrary k-sparse, n-dimensional signal x can be recovered with SNR - Î©(log n) and measurements scaling as m = Î©Ì,(log n /k) for all sparsity levels k satisfying 0 <; k â‰¤ an, where a is a sufficiently small positive constant. Surprisingly, this bound matches the optimal Max-Likelihood performance bounds in terms of SNR, re quired number of measurements, and admissible sparsity level in an order-wise sense. In contrast to our results, previous results based on LASSO and Max-Correlation techniques either assume significantly larger SNR, sub-linear sparsity levels or restrictive assumptions on signal sets. Our proof technique is based on noisy perturbation of the noiseless â„“1 problem, in that, we estimate the maximum admissible noise level before sign pattern recovery fails.",2011,IEEE Transactions on Information Theory

Benchmark of lasso-like penalties in the Cox model for TCGA datasets reveal improved performance with pre-filtering and wide differences between cancers,"Motivation Prediction of patient survival from tumor molecular â€˜omicsâ€™ data is a key step toward personalized medicine. With this aim, the databases available are growing, with the collection of various â€˜omicsâ€™ characterizations of patient tumors, together with their associated clinical outcomes for weeks to years of follow-up. Cox models with variable selection used with RNA profiling datasets are popular for identification of prognostic biomarkers and for clinical predictions. However, these models are confronted with the â€˜curse of dimensionalityâ€™, as the number p of covariates (genes) can greatly exceed the number n of patients. To tackle this problem, variance-based pre-filtering and penalization methods are popular for dimension reduction. In the present paper, we study the impact of a pre-filtering step based on gene variability, and we evaluate the performance of the lasso penalization of the Cox model and four variants (i.e., elastic net, adaptive elastic net, ridge, univariate Cox) in terms of prediction, selection and stability. Results First, we show that the prediction capacity with the Cox penalties method is cancer dependent. Second, we develop a methodology to fix a threshold to filter out genes with low variability without losing prediction capacity. Third, we show that it is best not to use the Cox model to select prognostic biomarkers, as its false discovery proportion is always â‰¥ 50%. Finally, to predict overall survival, we can suggest the use of the ridge penalty, or the elastic net if a more parsimonious model is needed, after the pre-filtering step.

Can We Relinquish the Transcendental?,"Is contemporary continental European philosophy preparing itself to break with Kant? An attack upon supposedly indestructible structures of knowledge is happening today: finitude of the subject, phenomenal given, a priori synthesis. â€œRelinquishing the transcendentalâ€: such is the leading project of postcritical thinking in the early twenty-first century as it appears in Quentin Meillassouxâ€™s book After Finitude. Some questions that we thought could never be raised after the Critique of Pure Reason are reappearing with a renewed force: Was Kant genuinely able to deduce categories instead of imposing them, to prove the necessity of nature, to found the difference between â€œa prioriâ€ and â€œinnateâ€? Should we consider, on the contrary, that the â€œproblem of Humeâ€â€”the existence of an irreducible contingency of the worldâ€”has never been settled by the Transcendental Deduction? Such a claim implies that we are provided a sufficiently convincing concept of the irregularity of the laws of nature and of the possibility of a totally different world. Does After Finitude elaborate such concepts?",2014,The Journal of Speculative Philosophy
Estimation of no photooxidation reactivities of olefins from molecular structure,"Olefins are the most reactive class of hydrocarbons in smog formation. A simple model has been developed for estimating their reactivities (expressed as rate of formation of NO2). 
 
An olefin is considered to be composed of two structural groups joined by the double bond. Each structural group can be characterized by a rate factor for a given set of experimental conditions. The reactivity of the olefin is given by the product of the corresponding rate factors. Using data by Glasson and Tuesday (1970), it has been verified that rate factors derived from one set of olefins can be used successfully for predicting the reactivities of a different set of olefins. Predicted and measured reactivities agree well and have a correlation coefficient of +0.998. 
 
From N different structural groups, it is possible to predict the reactivities of N(N + 1)2 olefins. Rate factors can also be estimated from known rate factors of similar structural groups (different in carbon number), further increasing the number of possible predictions.",1974,Atmospheric Environment

"Age of the Mfamosing Limestone , Calabar Flank , South Eastern , Nigeria","Abstract-Palynological analyses of outcrop samples and cores from two (2) wells were used in the determination of the age of the Mfamosing Limestone. Quantitative palynological analyses of the shaly intercalations in outcrop sections and the shales immediately overlying this limestone formation reveals the presence of index Albian-Cenomanian palynomorphs such as Classopollis jardinei, Ephedripites procerus, Ephedripites striagatus, Elaterosporites protensus and Elaterosporites sp. The palynological analyses points to a Mid Albian â€“ Early Cenomanian age for the Mfamosing Limestone.",2010,
The polychaete Cirriformia punctata is chemically defended against generalist coral reef predators,"The Caribbean cirratulid polychaete, Cirriformia punctata (Grube, 1856), is bright orange and burrows just below the surface of fine carbonate sand with only its filamentous tentacles and gills exposed to potential predators. In addition to its conspicuous coloration, C. punctata lacks obvious structural and morphological defenses. We hypothesized that C. punctata protects itself from predation using secondary metabolites as a chemical defense. Feeding bioassays were performed using whole worms to determine palatability against two generalist coral reef predators: the bluehead wrasse, Thalassoma bifasciatum, and the brown anemone, Aiptasia sp. Additionally, assays were conducted with hermit crabs of the genus Paguristes, but with limited success. In all assays, C. punctata was unpalatable to consumers. The tentacles and body of the worm were separately assayed using T. bifasciatum to determine whether the defensive mechanism was differentially allocated to body regions that are differently exposed to potential predators. Both the tentacles and body of C. punctata were unpalatable to T. bifasciatum, indicating no specific allocation of defenses. Crude organic extracts of whole C. punctata were unpalatable to T. bifasciatum, confirming that the worm defense is chemical rather than morphological. Chemical defenses of Cirriformia spp. appear to be generally effective against taxonomically diverse potential consumers.",2007,Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology

Bayesian lasso is used to find the posterior distributions of logistic regression coefficients, which are then used to calculate Bayes Factor and credible set to test for association with haplotypes, environmental covariates and interactions. The model can handle complex sampling data, in particular, frequency matched cases and controls with controls obtained using stratified sampling. This version can also be applied to a dataset with no environmental covariate and two correlated binary phenotypes. Zhang Y, Hofmann J, Purdue M, Lin S, and Biswas S (2017) <doi:10.1038/jhg.2017.43>.
