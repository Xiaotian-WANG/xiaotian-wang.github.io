Threeâ€dimensional receiver deghosting of seismic streamer data using L1 inversion and redundant extended radon dictionary,"In this paper, we propose a novel three-dimensional receiver deghosting algorithm that is capable of deghosting both horizontal and slanted streamer data in a theoretically consistent manner. Our algorithm honours wave propagation phenomena in a true three-dimensional sense and frames the three-dimensional receiver deghosting problem as a Lasso problem. The ultimate goal is to minimise the mismatch between the actual measurements and the simulated wavefield with an L1 constraint applied in the extended Radon space to handle the underdetermined nature of this problem.We successfully demonstrate our algorithm on a modified three-dimensional EAGE/SEG Overthrust model and a Red Sea marine dataset.",2018,Geophysical Prospecting
Challenges at the transition from primary to secondary school with regard to English teaching,"Ziel dieser Arbeit ist es, Herausforderungen und Probleme im Zusammenhang mit dem Ubergang von der Volksschule in die weiterfuhrenden Schulen (Neue Mittelschule/Hauptschule, AHS) in Osterreich aufzuzeigen. Daruber hinaus sollen Moglichkeiten dargelegt werden, diese Probleme zu losen und den Ubergang zu erleichtern. Der Schwerpunkt liegt dabei auf dem Ubergang hinsichtlich des Englischunterrichts. Weiters beinhaltet die Arbeit die Ergebnisse einer qualitativen Studie, die sich mit den Ansichten von LehrerInnen in einer Volksschule und in zwei Sekundarschulen in Vorarlberg auseinander setzt. 
Ubergange sind naturgemas sensible und kritische Lebensereignisse, was auf jenen von der Volksschule in die weiterfuhrenden Schulen besonders zutrifft, da dieser wichtige Entscheidungen verlangt, welche Kinder im Alter von 10 bis 11 Jahren noch nicht alleine treffen konnen. Ich nahere mich dem Thema der sogenannten â€žNahtstellenproblematikâ€œ auf zwei Arten. Im ersten Teil der Arbeit setze ich mich mit der deutschsprachigen Literatur zum Thema auseinander. Dabei werden haufig am Ubergang auftretende Herausforderungen aus den Blickwinkeln der drei am direktesten davon betroffenen Personengruppen diskutiert, namlich aus jenen der SchulerInnen, der LehrerInnen und der Eltern. Danach wird der Ubergang in Bezug auf den Englischunterricht besprochen, wobei unter anderem auf individuelle Unterschiede zwischen Lernern sowie auf Moglichkeiten zur Erleichterung des Ubergangs eingegangen wird. Die letzten beiden Kapitel der Literaturbesprechung beinhalten Informationen uber das osterreichische Schulsystem und einen Vergleich dreier Englischschulbucher (LASSO4, MORE1!, The New You & Me 1) mit Blick auf die Nahtstelle. 
Im zweiten Teil der Arbeit werden die Ergebnisse der in meinem Heimatbundesland Vorarlberg durchgefuhrten qualitativen Studie prasentiert. Das Ziel der Untersuchung ist es, einen Einblick in die Lehrerperspektive auf die Nahtstelle zu bekommen, wobei der Fokus wiederum auf dem Fach Englisch liegt. Zu diesem Zweck habe ich neun halbstrukturierte Leitfadeninterviews mit LehrerInnen und DirektorInnen von drei verschiedenen Vorarlberger Schulen durchgefuhrt. Die Ergebnisse zeugen von einem wachsenden Bewusstsein fur die Wichtigkeit des Ubergangs, aber sie deuten auch auf eine Lucke zwischen Primar- und Sekundarschulen hin. Diese Lucke wurzelt hauptsachlich in mangelhafter Kommunikation und Kooperation zwischen den Schulen. Moglichkeiten, dieses Problem zu bewaltigen sind, unter anderem, erhohte Kooperation zwischen Schulen, sowie vermehrter Austausch zwischen LehrerInnen der verschiedenen Schultypen und Veranderungen im Lehrplan. Auf Volksschulebene muss ein gemeinsamer Standard fur den Englischunterricht gewahrleistet werden, wahrend die Aufgabe der Sekundarschulen darin besteht, die Englischkenntnisse der Erstklassler in den Unterricht mit einzubeziehen.",2012,
Elastic Net Hypergraph Learning for Image Clustering and Semi-Supervised Classification,"Graph model is emerging as a very effective tool for learning the complex structures and relationships hidden in data. In general, the critical purpose of graph-oriented learning algorithms is to construct an informative graph for image clustering and classification tasks. In addition to the classical K-nearest-neighbor and r-neighborhood methods for graph construction, l1-graph and its variants are emerging methods for finding the neighboring samples of a center datum, where the corresponding ingoing edge weights are simultaneously derived by the sparse reconstruction coefficients of the remaining samples. However, the pairwise links of l1-graph are not capable of capturing the high-order relationships between the center datum and its prominent data in sparse reconstruction. Meanwhile, from the perspective of variable selection, the l1 norm sparse constraint, regarded as a LASSO model, tends to select only one datum from a group of data that are highly correlated and ignore the others. To simultaneously cope with these drawbacks, we propose a new elastic net hypergraph learning model, which consists of two steps. In the first step, the robust matrix elastic net model is constructed to find the canonically related samples in a somewhat greedy way, achieving the grouping effect by adding the l2 penalty to the l1 constraint. In the second step, hypergraph is used to represent the high order relationships between each datum and its prominent samples by regarding them as a hyperedge. Subsequently, hypergraph Laplacian matrix is constructed for further analysis. New hypergraph learning algorithms, including unsupervised clustering and multi-class semi-supervised classification, are then derived. Extensive experiments on face and handwriting databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",2017,IEEE Transactions on Image Processing
Robust geomechanical characterization by analyzing the performance of shallow-learning regression methods using unsupervised clustering methods,"Abstract Sonic logging tool can acquire compressional and shear travel-time logs (DTC and DTS), which aid geomechanical characterization. Six shallow-learning regression models were trained to process 13 â€œeasy-to-acquireâ€ conventional logs for synthesizing the DTC and DTS logs. The six shallow-learning models used in this study are ordinary least squares (OLS), partial least squares (PLS), elastic net (EN), LASSO, multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), and artificial neural network (ANN). The shallow-learning models were trained and tested on logs from a 4240-ft depth interval in a shale reservoir in Well 1. Five clustering methods, namely, K-means, hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN, self-organizing map, and Gaussian mixture model, were applied on the 13 â€œeasy-to-acquireâ€ logs. Clusters identified using the K-means clustering have a strong correlation with the performance of the shallow-learning regression models. Dimensionality reduction technique is used to visualize the performance of the clustering methods. In conclusion, sonic logs can be synthesized using shallow-learning regression models, and K-means clustering can be used to determine the reliability of the sonic-log synthesis using the shallow-learning methods.",2020,

â€˜Per mia particolare devotioneâ€™: Orlando di Lassoâ€™s Lagrime di San Pietro and Catholic Spirituality in Counter-Reformation Munich,"In his magisterial Lagrime di San Pietro (1595) Orlando di Lasso composed a cycle of 20 madrigals on texts by Luigi Tansillo on the theme of St Peterâ€™s denial of Christ and his subsequent remorse, capped by a Latin motet (â€˜Vide homoâ€™) representing the rebuke of the crucified Christ. The Lagrime may be seen as a penitential gesture on Lassoâ€™s part, but a textual and musical analysis also suggests numerous parallels with contemporary Catholic spiritual exercises, particularly those of Ignatius of Loyola and Luis ofGranada. The cycle thus takes its place in a broader Counter-Reformation discourse of meditation and penance.",2007,Journal of the Royal Musical Association

Assessing the Efficiency of Hospitals by Using Pabon Lasso Graphic Model,"One of the main issues in hospitals is assessment of their efficiency. Evaluation and comparison of hospitals is made possible through assessment of performance indicators. This study aimed to compare performance of hospitals through performance indicators using Pabon Lasso graphic model. Performance of seven hospitals affiliated to Busheher University of Medical Sciences was evaluated from 2009 to 2011. Selected indicators of this comparison were analyzed using Pabon Lasso graphic model. According to study results, less than half of the hospitals were in zone 1 of the chart (the most inefficient zone), and only 20% were in zone 3 (the most efficient zone). Three hospitals: Zainabieh, Choromi, and Baqiyatallah were in zone 1 in every one of three years, and Imam Khomeini Hospital in zone 2 (low bed occupancy rate, high bed turnover ratio). Fatemeh-Zahra Hospital was in zones 3, 4 and on the border of 3 and 4, respectively. 17 Shahrivar Hospital was in zone 2 in the first year, and moved to zone 3 for the next two years. Amiralmomenin Hospital was also in zones 2 and 3, and returned to zone 2. Considering inefficiency of hospitals in zone 1, adopting appropriate strategies to reduce services can be beneficial. Hospitals in zone 3 are advised to maintain status quo, and finally, hospitals in zones 2 and 4 can near efficient zone by proper management and improvement of their performance indicators.",2014,

Horseshoe Regularization for Feature Subset Selection,"Feature subset selection arises in many high-dimensional applications of statistics, such as compressed sensing and genomics. The $\ell_0$ penalty is ideal for this task, the caveat being it requires the NP-hard combinatorial evaluation of all models. A recent area of considerable interest is to develop efficient algorithms to fit models with a non-convex $\ell_\gamma$ penalty for $\gamma\in (0,1)$, which results in sparser models than the convex $\ell_1$ or lasso penalty, but is harder to fit. We propose an alternative, termed the horseshoe regularization penalty for feature subset selection, and demonstrate its theoretical and computational advantages. The distinguishing feature from existing non-convex optimization approaches is a full probabilistic representation of the penalty as the negative of the logarithm of a suitable prior, which in turn enables efficient expectation-maximization and local linear approximation algorithms for optimization and MCMC for uncertainty quantification. In synthetic and real data, the resulting algorithms provide better statistical performance, and the computation requires a fraction of time of state-of-the-art non-convex solvers.",2017,arXiv: Machine Learning
Learning from high-dimensional multivariate signals,"Learning from high-dimensional multivariate signals by Arnau Tibau Puig Chair: Alfred O. Hero III Modern measurement systems monitor a growing number of variables at low cost. In the problem of statistically characterizing the observed measurements, budget limitations usually constrain the number n of samples that one can acquire, leading to situations where the number p of variables is much larger than n. In this situation, classical statistical methods, founded on the assumption that n is large and p is fixed, fail both in theory and in practice. A successful approach to overcome this problem is to assume a parsimonious generative model characterized by a number k of free parameters, where k is much smaller than p. In this dissertation we develop algorithms to fit low-dimensional generative models and extract relevant information from high-dimensional, multivariate signals. First, we define extensions of the well-known Scalar Shrinkage-Thresholding Operator, that we name Multidimensional and Generalized Shrinkage-Thresholding Operators, and show that these extensions arise in numerous algorithms for structured-sparse linear and non-linear regression. Using convex optimization techniques, we show that these operators, defined as the solutions to a class of convex, non-differentiable, optimization problems have an equivalent convex, low-dimensional reformulation. Our equivalence results shed light on the behavior of a general class of penalties that includes classical sparsity-inducing penalties such as the LASSO and the Group LASSO. In addition, our reformulation leads in some cases to new efficient algorithms for a variety of high-dimensional penalized estimation problems. Second, we introduce two new classes of low-dimensional factor models that account for temporal shifts commonly occurring in multivariate signals. Our first conxviii tribution, called Order Preserving Factor Analysis, can be seen as an extension of the non-negative, sparse matrix factorization model to allow for order-preserving temporal translations in the data. We develop an efficient descent algorithm to fit this model using techniques from convex and non-convex optimization. Our second contribution extends Principal Component Analysis to the analysis of observations suffering from arbitrary circular shifts, and we call it Misaligned Principal Component Analysis. We quantify the effect of the misalignments in the spectrum of the sample covariance matrix in the high-dimensional regime and develop simple algorithms to jointly estimate the principal components and the misalignment parameters. All our algorithms are validated with both synthetic and real data. The real data is a high-dimensional longitudinal gene expression dataset obtained from blood samples of individuals inoculated by different types of viruses. Our results demonstrate the benefit of applying tailored, low-dimensional models to learn from high-dimensional multivariate temporal signals.",2012,
Coherence Pattern-Guided Compressive Sensing with Unresolved Grids,"Highly coherent sensing matrices arise in discretization of continuum imaging problems such as radar and medical imaging when the grid spacing is below the Rayleigh threshold. Algorithms based on techniques of band exclusion (BE) and local optimization (LO) are proposed to deal with such coherent sensing matrices. These techniques are embedded in the existing compressed sensing algorithms, such as Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP), Subspace Pursuit (SP), Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT), Basis Pursuit (BP), and Lasso, and result in the modified algorithms BLOOMP, BLOSP, BLOIHT, BP-BLOT, and Lasso-BLOT, respectively. Under appropriate conditions, it is proved that BLOOMP can reconstruct sparse, widely separated objects up to one Rayleigh length in the Bottleneck distance independent of the grid spacing. One of the most distinguishing attributes of BLOOMP is its capability of dealing with large dynamic ranges. The BLO-based algorithms are systematically tested with respect to four performance metrics: dynamic range, noise stability, sparsity, and resolution. With respect to dynamic range and noise stability, BLOOMP is the best performer. With respect to sparsity, BLOOMP is the best performer for high dynamic range, while for dynamic range near unity BP-BLOT and Lasso-BLOT with the optimized regularization parameter have the best performance. In the noiseless case, BP-BLOT has the highest resolving power up to certain dynamic range. The algorithms BLOSP and BLOIHT are good alternatives to BLOOMP and BP/Lasso-BLOT: they are faster than both BLOOMP and BP/Lasso-BLOT and share, to a lesser degree, BLOOMP's amazing attribute with respect to dynamic range. Detailed comparisons with the algorithms Spectral Iterative Hard Thresholding (SIHT) and the frame-adapted BP demonstrate the superiority of the BLO-based algorithms for the problem of sparse approximation in terms of highly coherent, redundant dictionaries.",2012,ArXiv
The Effect of Food Quality and Rearing Density on the Growth and Survival of Epibenthic Juveniles of the Sea Cucumber Holothuria scabra,"Abstractâ€”Seven combinations of aquatic plant extracts were tested to feed juveniles of H. scabra: Thalassia hemprichii, T. hemprichii with 3 % Spirulina, Sargassum latifolium, S. latifolium with 3 % Spirulina, Thalassodendron ciliatum, Syringodium isoetifolium and organic biofilm. A control test consisted in rearing epibenthic juveniles in tank without any food supply. The results showed that extracts of S. latifolium with or without Spirulina gave the best growth and high survival rates: the mean epibenthic volumes were 112 +/- 55 mmÂ³ and 81 +/- 21 mm3 and the survival rates were 60 and 68 % respectively at the end of the experiment (8 weeks). Rearing densities of 150, 300, 450 and 600 individuals m m-2 were tested. The best survival rates (greater than 60 %) were observed in the batches with an initial density of 450 individuals m m-2 or less. The best growth rate was observed with an initial rearing density of 150 individuals m-Â². The study of biomass showed that the optimum level for the rearing density is 450 +/- 150 juveniles m m-2 . When the parameters of survival, growth rate and biomass (expressed in volume) are all taken into consideration, the optimum rearing density suggested for epibenthic juveniles of H. scabra is between 300 and 450 individuals m-2 .

Long before 'theory of musical figures' (Figurenlehre) had been systematically established in the 17th and 18th century, there were many composers who had used 'Musical figures of rhetoric' (musikalisch-rhetorische Figuren) to compose. For example: G. Dufay (1397-1474) and O. di Lasso(1530/32-1594) in the 15th and 16th century. Not until Baroque period, had the theory of 'rhetoric of music' (Musikalische Rhetorik) become the important basis to compose. One of these theories is J. Burmeister's theory of 'rhetoric of music' which will be discussed in the article.After summarizing the historical background and sources of the theories of 'rhetoric of music', the main points of this article is mainly to discuss Burmeister's theory of 'rhetoric of music' and how to express the emotion of poor, fear, sadness and happiness by using certain peculiar figures. Besides, this discussion will also point out how theorists in different aspects expounded, defined, depicted and distinguished these figures, which expressed different emotions, to establish related theories.",2005,
Capturing the musical brain with Lasso: Dynamic decoding of musical features from fMRI data,"We investigated neural correlates of musical feature processing with a decoding approach. To this end, we used a method that combines computational extraction of musical features with regularized multiple regression (LASSO). Optimal model parameters were determined by maximizing the decoding accuracy using a leave-one-out cross-validation scheme. The method was applied to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data that were collected using a naturalistic paradigm, in which participants' brain responses were recorded while they were continuously listening to pieces of real music. The dependent variables comprised musical feature time series that were computationally extracted from the stimulus. We expected timbral features to obtain a higher prediction accuracy than rhythmic and tonal ones. Moreover, we expected the areas significantly contributing to the decoding models to be consistent with areas of significant activation observed in previous research using a naturalistic paradigm with fMRI. Of the six musical features considered, five could be significantly predicted for the majority of participants. The areas significantly contributing to the optimal decoding models agreed to a great extent with results obtained in previous studies. In particular, areas in the superior temporal gyrus, Heschl's gyrus, Rolandic operculum, and cerebellum contributed to the decoding of timbral features. For the decoding of the rhythmic feature, we found the bilateral superior temporal gyrus, right Heschl's gyrus, and hippocampus to contribute most. The tonal feature, however, could not be significantly predicted, suggesting a higher inter-participant variability in its neural processing. A subsequent classification experiment revealed that segments of the stimulus could be classified from the fMRI data with significant accuracy. The present findings provide compelling evidence for the involvement of the auditory cortex, the cerebellum and the hippocampus in the processing of musical features during continuous listening to music.",2014,NeuroImage

Selection of Ordinally Scaled Independent Variables,"Ordinal categorial variables are a common case in regression modeling. Although the case of ordinal response variables has been well investigated, less work has been done concerning ordinal predictors. This article deals with the selection of ordinally scaled independent variables in the classical linear model, where the ordinal structure is taken into account by use of a dierence penalty on adjacent dummy coecients. It is shown how the Group Lasso can be used for the selection of ordinal predictors, and an alternative blockwise Boosting procedure is proposed. Emphasis is placed on the application of the presented methods to the (Comprehensive) ICF Core Set for chronic widespread pain.",2009,
Variable selection and inference in a follow-up study on back pain,"The Lasso of Tibshirani (1996) is a useful method for estimation and implicit selection of predictors in a linear regression model, by using a 1-penalty, if the number of observations is not markedly larger than the number of possible predictors. 
We apply the Lasso to a predictive linear regression model in a study with baseline and follow up measurement for unspecific low back pain with a focus on the selection of psycho sociological predictors. Practitioners want to report measures of 
uncertainty for estimated regression coefficients, i.e. p-values or confidence intervals, 
where post selection classical t-tests are not valid anymore. In the last few years 
several approaches for inference in high-dimensional data settings have been developed. 
We do a selective overview on assigning p-values to Lasso selected variables 
and analyse two methods in a simulation study using the structure of our data set. 
We found out that Multi Sample Splitting (Wasserman and Roeder, 2009; Meinshausen et al., 2009) may not be helpful for generating p-values, while the LDPE approach of Zhang and Zhang (2014) produces promising results for type-I-errors and power calculations on single hypotheses. Therefore, we apply the LDPE for the analysis of our back pain study.",2017,

Identification of Grouped Rare and Common Variants via Penalized Logistic Regression,"In spite of the success of genome-wide association studies in finding many common variants associated with disease, these variants seem to explain only a small proportion of the estimated heritability. Data collection has turned toward exome and whole genome sequencing, but it is well known that single marker methods frequently used for common variants have low power to detect rare variants associated with disease, even with very large sample sizes. In response, a variety of methods have been developed that attempt to cluster rare variants so that they may gather strength from one another under the premise that there may be multiple causal variants within a gene. Most of these methods group variants by gene or proximity, and test one gene or marker window at a time. We propose a penalized regression method (PeRC) that analyzes all genes at once, allowing grouping of all (rare and common) variants within a gene, along with subgrouping of the rare variants, thus borrowing strength from both rare and common variants within the same gene. The method can incorporate either a burden-based weighting of the rare variants or one in which the weights are data driven. In simulations, our method performs favorably when compared to many previously proposed approaches, including its predecessor, the sparse group lasso [Friedman etÂ al., 2010].",2013,Genetic Epidemiology
Learning and transferring motion style using Sparse PCA,"Motion style transfer is a primary problem in computer animation, allowing us to convert the motion of an actor to that of another one. Myriads approaches have been developed to perform this task, however, the majority of them are data-driven, which require a large dataset and a time-consuming period for training a model in order to achieve good results. In contrast, we propose a novel method applied successfully for this task in a small dataset. This exploits Sparse PCA to decompose original motions into smaller components which are learned with particular constraints. The synthesized results are highly precise and smooth motions with its emotion as shown in our experiments.Keywords

Neuronized Priors for Bayesian Sparse Linear Regression.,"Although Bayesian variable selection procedures have been widely adopted in many scientific research fields, their routine use in practice has not caught up with their non-Bayesian counterparts, such as Lasso, due to difficulties in both Bayesian computations and in testing effects of different prior distributions. To ease these challenges, we propose the neuronized priors to unify and extend existing shrinkage priors such as one-group continuous shrinkage priors, continuous spike-and-slab priors, and discrete spike-and-slab priors with point-mass mixtures. The new priors are formulated as the product of a weight variable and a scale variable. The weight is a Gaussian random variable, but the scale is a Gaussian variable controlled through an activation function. By altering the activation function, practitioners can easily implement a large class of Bayesian variable selection procedures. Compared with classic spike and slab priors, the neuronized priors achieve the same explicit variable selection without employing any latent indicator variable, which results in more efficient MCMC algorithms and more effective posterior modal estimates obtained from a simple coordinate-ascent algorithm. We examine a wide range of simulated and real data examples and also show that using the ""neuronization"" representation is computationally more or comparably efficient than its standard counterpart in all well-known cases.",2018,arXiv: Methodology
The influence of habitat structure and flow permanence on macroinvertebrate assemblages in temporary rivers in northwestern Zimbabwe,"Temporary rivers within the Nyaodza-Gachegache subcatchment in northwestern Zimbabwe were investigated to examine the role of flow permanence and habitat structure on macroinvertebrate community composition. Macroinvertebrate communities of intermittent and ephemeral rivers displayed significant differences in the number of taxa, macroinvertebrate abundance, Shannon and Simpson diversity indices and in size class structure. Intermittent sites were characterised by higher numbers of taxa, diversity and Ephemeroptera and Trichoptera richness compared to ephemeral sites. The fauna of ephemeral sites was dominated by a single taxon (Afrobaetodes) (Ephemeroptera, Baetidae) whilst larger sized taxa (e.g. Elassoneuria (Ephemeroptera, Oligoneuriidae), Dicentroptilum (Ephemeroptera, Baetidae), Aethaloptera (Trichoptera, Hydropsychidae), Pseudagrion (Odonata, Coenagrionidae) and Tholymis (Odonata, Libellulidae) were exclusively restricted to intermittent sites. Clear differences were observed between sand, gravel, cobble and vegetation habitats. Vegetation and cobbles supported distinct communities, with some taxa exclusively restricted either to vegetation (e.g. Pseudagrion, Leptocerina (Trichoptera, Leptoceridae), Cloeon (Ephemeroptera, Baetidae), Afronurus (Ephemeroptera, Heptageniidae) and Povilla (Ephemeroptera, Polymitarcidae) or cobble (e.g. Aethaloptera and Dicentroptilum) habitats. In terms of ensuring optimum diversity within the subcatchment, we consider conservation of critical habitats (cobbles and vegetation) and maintenance of natural flows as the appropriate management actions.",2008,Hydrobiologia

A Study of High-Dimensional Data Imputation Using Additive LASSO Regression Model,"With the rapid growth of computational domains, bioinformatics finance, engineering, biometrics, and neuroimaging emphasize the necessity for analyzing high-dimensional data. Many real-world datasets may contain hundreds or thousands of features. The common problem in most of the knowledge-based classification problems is quality and quantity of data. In general, the common problem with many high-dimensional data samples is that it contains missing or unknown attribute values, incomplete feature vectors, and uncertain or vague data which have to be handled carefully. Due to the presence of a large segment of missing values in the datasets, refined multiple imputation methods are required to estimate the missing values so that a fair and more consistent analysis can be achieved. In this paper, three imputation (MI) methods, mean, imputations predictive mean, and imputations by additive LASSO, are employed in cloud. Results show that imputations by additive LASSO are the preferred multiple imputation (MI) method.",2019,

Constrained Grouped Sparsity,"In this paper, we propose an algorithm encouraging group sparsity under some convex constraint. It stems from some applications where the regression coefficients are subject to constraints, for example nonnegativity and the explanatory variables are not suitable to be orthogonalized within groups. It takes the form of the group LASSO based on linear regression model where a L1/L2 norm is imposed on group coefficients to achieve group sparsity. It differs from the original group LASSO in the following ways. First, the regression coefficients must obey some convex constraints. Second, there is no requirement for orthogonality of the variables within individual groups. For these reasons, the simple blockwise coordinate descent for all group coefficients is no longer applicable and a special treatment for the constraint is necessary. The algorithm we proposed in this paper is an alternating direction method, and both exact and inexact solutions are provided. The inexact version simplifies the computation while retaining practical convergence. As an approximation to group L0, it can be applied to data analysis where group fitting is essential and the coefficients are constrained. It may serve as a screening procedure to reduce the number of the groups when the number of total groups is prohibitively high.",2012,
Humans into Birds: Italian Interpretation of Gender in Canadian Theatre,"Abstract 
This research paper aims at showing how a play focused on the rhetoric of gender discrimination can be instrumental to challenge the multifaceted reality of violence. The approach to the play â€“ a contemporary adaptation from Ovidâ€™s Metamorphoses (Book VI) by Canadian playwright Erin Shields â€“ consists of a combination of a philological, linguistic and critical tool able to foreground the way in which language functions, and to interpret the inter-and infra-textualities that make up the work as a whole (Barthes, 1977; Kristeva, 1986). The sacred dimension of myth (whether religious or secular) is also studied in its interaction with human rights, the horror of wars, and the process of becoming inhumane. (Calasso, 2001; Gutmann & Taylor, 1994.). The analysis of the text shows how the violence against woman dealt with in myth is very similar to the violence perpetrated on women during todayâ€™s wars. It also shows that violence begets more violence on the part of the victim, who becomes, in turn, a perpetrator herself, in an endless cycle of inhumane actions. The research is directed specifically at an intellectual, rather than active, involvement, and it primarily argues that gender equality needs being enabled in human relationships, and it must preside over punishment. When a reaction to female violation is set in motion in terms of a just as violent revenge, then a metamorphosis of people into beasts is equally (and justly) applied (by the Gods) to male and female inhuman behaviour. That is how Shields takes the opportunity to critique gender equality in the theatre.",2015,
Integrative analysis based on survival associated co-expression gene modules for predicting Neuroblastoma patientsâ€™ survival time,"BackgroundMore than 90% of neuroblastoma patients are cured in the low-risk group while only less than 50% for those with high-risk disease can be cured. Since the high-risk patients still have poor outcomes, we need more accurate stratification to establish an individualized precise treatment plan for the patients to improve the long-term survival rate.ResultsWe focus on extracting features and providing a workflow to improve survival prediction for neuroblastoma patients. With a workflow for gene co-expression network (GCN) mining in microarray and RNA-Seq datasets, we extracted molecular features from each co-expressed module and summarized them into eigengenes. Then we adopted the lasso-regularized Cox proportional hazards model to select the most informative eigengene features regarding association to the risk of metastasis. Nine eigengenes were selected which show strong association with patient survival prognosis. All of the nine corresponding gene modules also have highly enriched biological functions or cytoband locations. Three of them are unique modules to RNA-Seq data, which complement the modules from microarray data in terms of survival prognosis. We then merged all eigengenes from these unique modules and used an integrative method called Similarity Network Fusion to test the prognostic power of these eigengenes for prognosis. The prognostic accuracies are significantly improved as compared to using all eigengenes, and a subgroup of patients with very poor survival rate was identified.ConclusionsWe first compared GCNs mined from microarray and RNA-seq data. We discovered that each data modality yields unique GCNs, which are enriched with clear biological functions. Then we do module unique analysis and use lasso-cox model to select survival-associated eigengenes. Integration of unique and survival-associated eigengenes from both data types provides complementary information that leads to more accurate survival prognosis.ReviewersReviewed by Susmita Datta, Marco Chierici and Dimitar Vassilev.",2018,Biology Direct

Determinants of elliptic pseudo-differential operators,"Determinants of invertible pseudo-differential operators (PDOs) close to positive self-adjoint ones are defined throughthe zeta-function regularization. We define a multiplicative anomaly as the ratio $\det(AB)/(\det(A)\det(B))$ considered as a functionon pairs of elliptic PDOs. We obtained an explicit formula for the multiplicative anomaly in terms of symbols of operators. For a certain natural classof PDOs on odd-dimensional manifolds generalizing the class of ellipticdifferential operators, the multiplicative anomaly is identically $1$. For elliptic PDOs from this class a holomorphic determinant and a determinant for zero orders PDOs are introduced. Using various algebraic, analytic, and topological tools we study local and global properties of the multiplicative anomaly and of the determinant Lie group closely related with it. The Lie algebra for the determinant Lie group has a description in terms of symbols only. Our main discovery is that there is a {\em quadratic non-linearity} hidden in the definition of determinants of PDOs through zeta-functions. The natural explanation of this non-linearity follows from complex-analytic properties of a new trace functional TR on PDOs of non-integer orders. Using TR we easily reproduce known facts about noncommutative residues of PDOs and obtain several new results. In particular, we describe a structure of derivatives of zeta-functions at zero as of functions on logarithms of elliptic PDOs. We propose several definitions extending zeta-regularized determinants to general elliptic PDOs. For elliptic PDOs of nonzero complex orders we introduce a canonical determinant in its natural domain of definition.",1994,arXiv: High Energy Physics - Theory
Cell-Mediated Hemolytic Activity of Nosocomial Pseudomonas Aeruginosa Strains,Cell-mediated hemolysis and adhesion index of nosocomial P. aeruginosa strains were experimentally studied. The highest hemoglobin release was recorded after centrifugation of erythrocyte and bacterial cell suspension preincubated at 37Â C. All cultures were referred to highly adherent variants. The relationship between P. aeruginosa adhesion activity and erythrocyte lysis was found only in â€œpassiveâ€ cellâ€“cell contact. No correlation between cellassociated hemolysis and hemolysis caused by secreted factors was detected. It seems that the cytotoxicity of the studied P. aeruginosa strains was determined by ExoU and ExoS third type secretion effectors.,2015,Bulletin of Experimental Biology and Medicine
"The late Cenozoic Thiaridae (Mollusca, Gastropoda, Cerithioidea) of the Albertine Rift Valley (Uganda-Congo) and their bearing on the origin and evolution of the Tanganyikan thalassoid malacofauna","The recent cerithioid malacofauna of meromictic Lake Tanganyika is unique in its degree of thalassoid convergence with marine molluscs. This is generally considered the result of a long-lasting intensive escalation and cladogenesis caused by a coevolutionary preyâ€“predator interaction in a freshwater ecosystem with sea-like characteristics, i.e. exceptional longevity (ca. 7â€“12 Ma) and vast dimensions (present surface area: 32â€‰900 km2, present maximum depth: 1470 m). In the Albertine Basin, ca 300 km north of the Tanganyika Trough, Palaeolake Obweruka existed during Mio-Pliocene times. In many aspects, it can be considered as a 'sister lake' of Lake Tanganyika, being also long-lived (from ca 7.5 to 2.5 Ma), extensive (surface: 27â€‰000 km2) and meromictic. Like Lake Tanganyika it belonged to the Congo catchment. Although thalassoid molluscs have been known from the Albertine deposits since the beginning of the 20th Century, previous researchers recognised only four polymorphic thiarid species, two of which were thalassoid. Detailed in situ collecting shows that the perceived low species diversity and high variability of the Obwerukan thalassoids is a phenomenon of the museum drawer. In the field the thiarid species and other molluscs are not extremely polymorphic, as formerly thought, but tend to occur in discrete morphometric packages according to stratigraphic level and geographic area. The species richness of the Palaeolake Obweruka thiarids has thus been severely underestimated, as is also the case for the Recent Tanganyikan thiarids. The present authors discern 35 species and 7 genera in the Albertine deposits (2 of which are new to science), and consider this to be a conservative estimate. In their degree of diversification and morphological escalation, the Obwerukan thiarids are thus comparable to the Tanganyika thalassoids. Arguments are presented that the thalassoids of these lakes are polyphyletic, that they are derived from the same genera (mainly Potadoma, Potadomoides and Pseudocleopatra) and that the tempo and mode of their intralacustrine evolution must have been largely similar. As for the tempo of evolution, the Albertine fossil record shows that escalation in shell morphology and ornamentation in the Thiaridae was extremely rapid, as in the Ampullariidae and Viviparidae (Van Damme & Pickford, 1995, 1999). In the Thiaridae heavily ornate shells evolved from an unornamented ancestor in two consecutive bursts, each lasting less than 0.1 million years over a total period of ca. 1 million years. The punctuated escalation in the thiarids was initiated millions of years after the lake was formed. This implies that the degree of escalation is not related to age of a lake and that the Tanganyikan thalassoids or part of them may not be particularly old, even though Lake Tanganyika itself is. As to the mode of evolution, it appears that escalation is a coevolutionary reaction to predation but that this selective pressure only triggers a reaction under specific conditions and in synergy with other environmental factors. The Obwerukan thiarid fossil record also indicates that iterative evolution of molluscan shells may be of frequent occurrence. What is considered to be a single polymorphic chronospecies, static over a great length of time, may actually be a sequence of several species that branched at different moments from the same ancestral phenotype. Finally, there is the inference that bottle-necking may be, geologically speaking, so common that it forms an essential force in macroevolution.",2004,Hydrobiologia
"Yearly and inter-island variation in the recruitment dynamics of the bluehead wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum, Bloch)","Abstract The summer spawning and settlement patterns of Thalassoma bifasciatum (Bloch) in the Virgin Islands were back-calculated using daily increments of otoliths from recruits. Recruits were collected in July of each year of 1991â€“1993 from two sites on St. Croix, one on St. John, and one on Virgin Gorda. Spawning and settlement of T. bifasciatum exhibited slight lunar periodicity, with a tendency for more spawning around the last lunar quarter and higher settlement around the first lunar quarter. Settlement patterns failed to exhibit the brief episodes of intense settlement previously reported for this species, although weak pulses of settlement spread over several days were evident. Only in 1993 were settlement pulses coincident among sites, and this synchronous settlement was probably driven by a patch of water > 650 km 2 which was rich in larvae. In contrast to studies of this species at other sites, very few individuals recruiting to the Virgin Islands delayed metamorphosis. We conclude that settlement of this species in the Virgin Islands is patterned by the interaction of a relatively fixed larval duration with unpredictable oceanographic processes acting to transport larvae.",1997,Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology
Comparison of methods for sampling ectoparasites from coral reef fishes,"Methods for sampling ectoparasite assemblages were compared using 7 species of coral reef fishes (Acanthochromis polyacanthus, Thalassoma lunare, Ctenochaetus striatus, Chlorurus sordidus, Scolopsis bilineatus, Hemigymnus melapterus, and Siganus doliatus). Estimates of total numbers and composition of ectoparasites were dependent on post-collection handling techniques and the method of ectoparasite removal. Fish were enclosed within plastic bags under water at the point of capture. Filtration of water from the plastic bags revealed a large number of parasites (mainly gnathiid isopods) that had detached from the host on capture. A subsequent sea-water rinse removed a large number of ectoparasites, but further treatment with the anaesthetic chloretone released additional individuals. The few remaining parasites were removed by visual inspection. A chloretone bath was more effective than a sea-water bath at removing parasites. The species composition of parasites recovered by a chloretone bath plus a visual survey was different from that recovered with a sea-water bath and visual survey; this suggests that traditional scanning techniques may not detect all parasites.",1995,Marine and Freshwater Research
Information Spillovers and Predictable Currency Returns: An Analysis via Machine Learning,"This paper employs the post â€” Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (post â€” LASSO) to make rolling 1-month--ahead currency excess return forecasts using all other currencies' lagged forward discounts as candidate predictors. The trading strategy of buying (selling) quintile currency portfolios of the high (low) post â€” LASSO forecasts yields a monthly excess return of 1.05% for the 48-currency sample. The results do not change even after controlling for various predictors. The return predictive power of the post â€” LASSO comes from two sources.

Second, it incorporates cross-sectional variations in currencies' predictive relations with the origin currencies.",2019,
Classification of low-grade and high-grade glioma using multi-modal image radiomics features.,"Gliomas are primary brain tumors arising from glial cells. Gliomas can be classified into different histopathologic grades according to World Health Oraganization (WHO) grading system which represents malignancy. In this paper, we present a method to predict the grades of Gliomas using Radiomics imaging features. MICCAI Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge (BRATs 2015) training data, its segmentation ground truth and the ground truth labels were used for this work. 45 radiomics features based on histogram, shape and gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) were extracted from each FLAIR, T1, T1-Contrast, T2 image to quantify the property of Gliomas. Significant features among 180 features were selected through L1-norm regularization (LASSO). Based on LASSO coefficient and selected feature values, we computed a LASSO score and gliomas were classified into low-grade glimoa (LGG) or high-grade glimoa (HGG) through logistic regression. Classification result was validated by a 10-fold cross validation. Our method achieved accuracy of 0.8981, sensitivity of 0.8889, specificity of 0.9074, and area under the curve (AUC) = 0.8870.",2017,Conference proceedings : ...

Sparse regression and marginal testing using cluster prototypes.,"We propose a new approach for sparse regression and marginal testing, for data with correlated features. Our procedure first clusters the features, and then chooses as the cluster prototype the most informative feature in that cluster. Then we apply either sparse regression (lasso) or marginal significance testing to these prototypes. While this kind of strategy is not entirely new, a key feature of our proposal is its use of the post-selection inference theory of Taylor and others (2014, Exact post-selection inference for forward stepwise and least angle regression, Preprint, arXiv:1401.3889) and Lee and others (2014, Exact post-selection inference with the lasso, Preprint, arXiv:1311.6238v5) to compute exact [Formula: see text]-values and confidence intervals that properly account for the selection of prototypes. We also apply the recent ""knockoff"" idea of Barber and CandÃ¨s (2014, Controlling the false discovery rate via knockoffs, Preprint, arXiv:1404.5609) to provide exact finite sample control of the FDR of our regression procedure. We illustrate our proposals on both real and simulated data.",2016,Biostatistics
"Partial Correlation Screening for Estimating Large Precision Matrices, with Applications to Classification","We propose Partial Correlation Screening (PCS) as a new row-by-row approach to estimating a large precision matrix $\Omega$. To estimate the $i$-th row of $\Omega$, $1 \leq i \leq p$, PCS uses a Screen step and a Clean step. In the Screen step, PCS recruits a (small) subset of indices using a stage-wise algorithm, where in each stage, the algorithm updates the set of recruited indices by adding the index $j$ that has the largest (in magnitude) empirical partial correlation with $i$. In the Clean step, PCS re-investigates all recruited indices and use them to reconstruct the $i$-th row of $\Omega$. 
PCS is computationally efficient and modest in memory use: to estimate a row of $\Omega$, it only needs a few rows (determined sequentially) of the empirical covariance matrix. This enables PCS to execute the estimation of a large precision matrix (e.g., $p=10K$) in a few minutes, and open doors to estimating much larger precision matrices. 
We use PCS for classification. Higher Criticism Thresholding (HCT) is a recent classifier that enjoys optimality, but to exploit its full potential in practice, one needs a good estimate of the precision matrix $\Omega$. Combining HCT with any approach to estimating $\Omega$ gives a new classifier: examples include HCT-PCS and HCT-glasso. We have applied HCT-PCS to two large microarray data sets ($p = 8K$ and $10K$) for classification, where it not only significantly outperforms HCT-glasso, but also is competitive to the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF). The results suggest that PCS gives more useful estimates of $\Omega$ than the glasso.

Extending on current methods which use an extension of the Group LASSO for pitch estimation, this work introduces an adaptive total variation penalty, which both enforce group- and block sparsity, and deal with errors due to sub-octaves. The method is shown to outperform current state-of-the-art sparse methods, where the model orders are unknown, while also requiring fewer tuning parameters than these. The method is also shown to outperform several conventional pitch estimation methods, even when these are virtued with oracle model orders.",2015,2015 23rd European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)
A Predictive Model for Determining Patients Not Requiring Prolonged Hospital Length of Stay After Elective Primary Total Hip Arthroplasty.,"BACKGROUND
Hospital length of stay (LOS) is an important quality metric for total hip arthroplasty. Accurately predicting LOS is important to expectantly manage bed utilization and other hospital resources. We aimed to develop a predictive model for determining patients who do not require prolonged LOS.


METHODS
This was a retrospective single-institution study analyzing patients undergoing elective unilateral primary total hip arthroplasty from 2014 to 2016. The primary outcome of interest was LOS less than or equal to the expected duration, defined as â‰¤3 days. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to generate a model for this outcome, and a point-based calculator was designed. The model was built on a training set, and performance was assessed on a validation set. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test were calculated to determine discriminatory ability and goodness-of-fit, respectively. Predictive models using other machine learning techniques (ridge regression, Lasso, and random forest) were created, and model performances were compared.


RESULTS
The point-based score calculator included 9 variables: age, opioid use, metabolic equivalents score, sex, anemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, obesity, and primary anesthesia type. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the calculator on the validation set was 0.735 (95% confidence interval, 0.675-0.787) and demonstrated adequate goodness-of-fit (Hosmer-Lemeshow test, P = .37). When using a score of 12 as a threshold for predicting outcome, the positive predictive value was 86.1%.


CONCLUSIONS
A predictive model that can help identify patients at higher odds for not requiring a prolonged hospital LOS was developed and may aid hospital administrators in strategically planning bed availability to reduce both overcrowding and underutilization when coordinating with surgical volume.",2019,Anesthesia and analgesia
"First report of Kudoa species in the somatic muscle of the Japanese parrotfish Calotomus japonicus (Scaridae) and a description of Kudoa igami, n. sp. (Myxozoa: Multivalvulida)","Three species of the Kudoid parasite (Myxozoa: Multivalvulida) were observed in the somatic muscle of Japanese parrotfish Calotomus japonicus caught off the coast of western Japan. All three species formed pseudocysts in myofibers and caused subclinical infections. The three Kudoa species were distinguished by spore morphology, as well as their 18S and 28S rDNA sequences. We identified a previously undescribed taxa Kudoa igami n. sp. with spores that were stellate with rounded peripheral edges and five to six polar capsules (prevalence 29.3Â %). Kudoa igami n. sp. were morphologically most similar to Kudoa neothunni but were distinguishable by a more rounded shape in the apical view. Molecular analyses demonstrated that the K. igami n. sp. is closely related to Kudoa thalassomi; however, the similarity in the 28S rDNA sequence was <96Â % and the spore morphology was different. We found Kudoa thalassomi in one sample (prevalence 2.4Â %), which is a new host and geographical record for this species. Kudoa lateolabracis, which causes postmortem myoliquefaction in Chinese sea bass Lateolabrax sp. and olive flounder Paralichthys olivaceus was found in Japanese parrotfish (prevalence 41.5Â %) for the first time, but did not cause myoliquefaction. We also expanded the host record for the brain-infecting Kudoa yasunagai (prevalence 94.1Â %). In addition, an unidentified microsporidia was observed in the somatic muscle (prevalence 23.3Â %).",2014,Parasitology Research

Inexact Proximal Operators for $\ell_{p}$-Quasinorm Minimization,"Proximal methods are an important tool in signal processing applications, where many problems can be characterized by the minimization of an expression involving a smooth fitting term and a convex regularization term - for example the classic $\ell_{1}$ -Lasso. Such problems can be solved using the relevant proximal operator. Here we consider the use of proximal operators for the $\ell_{p}$ -quasinorm where $0\leq p\leq 1$. Rather than seek a closed form solution, we develop an iterative algorithm using a Majorization-Minimization procedure which results in an inexact operator. Experiments on image denoising show that for $p\leq 1$ the algorithm is effective in the high-noise scenario, outperforming the Lasso despite the inexactness of the proximal step.",2018,"2018 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)"
Generalization of â„“1 constraints for high dimensional regression problems,"We focus on the high dimensional linear regression Yâˆ¼N(XÎ²âˆ—,Ïƒ2In), where Î²âˆ—âˆˆRp is the parameter of interest. In this setting, several estimators such as the LASSO (Tibshirani, 1996) and the Dantzig Selector (Candes and Tao, 2007) are known to satisfy interesting properties whenever the vector Î²âˆ— is sparse. Interestingly, both the LASSO and the Dantzig Selector can be seen as orthogonal projections of 0 into DC(s)={Î²âˆˆRp,â€–Xâ€²(Yâˆ’XÎ²)â€–âˆžâ‰¤s}, using an l1 distance for the Dantzig Selector and l2 for the LASSO. For a well chosen s>0, this set is actually a confidence region for Î²âˆ—. In this paper, we investigate the properties of estimators defined as projections on DC(s) using general distances. We prove that the obtained estimators satisfy oracle properties close to the one of the LASSO and the Dantzig Selector. On top of that, it turns out that these estimators can be tuned to exploit a different sparsity or/and slightly different estimation objectives.",2008,Statistics & Probability Letters
French Marxist anthropology: twenty years after,"In this review article, the authors consider the recent collection of articles, edited by David Seddon (and translated by Helen Lackner), in Relations of Production, Marxist Approaches to Economic Anthropology. Rather than examining the articles per se, they use them as a startingâ€point for a general assessment of French Marxist anthropology, as a school with a given problematic, as it has developed over the last twenty years. They try to see the kind of research it has elicited, the sort of problems it has encountered, and the concepts it has used. They also put forward a number of criticisms of the basic assumptions of the school. The argument divides into two major sections. The first traces the emergence of Frenchâ€ Marxist anthropology from its constitution in the early 1960s, with the early contributions of Meillassoux and Godelier, to its consolidation in the 1970s, in the work of writers like Terray, Rey, Auge, etc. The second section sets out a number of assumptions common to the school, and raise...",1980,The Journal of Peasant Studies
Transtibial Pull-Out Repair of Converted Radial Tear Adjacent to Medial Meniscus Root,"Radial tears increase tibiofemoral contact pressure and disrupt the ability of the meniscus to withstand hoop stress, leading to earlier-onset osteoarthritis. Repair of radial tears is problematic because they have a lower healing rate and lack a single gold standard technique. However, when a radial tear is proximal to the root, there is an opportunity to convert it into a root tear. This is ideal because root tears fixed through a transtibial tunnel technique have improved clinical outcomes and reduced rates of osteoarthritis. This Technical Note and accompanying video describe a method for repairing a radial tear near the meniscus root by converting a radial tear to a root tear followed by a pull-out root repair through a transtibial tunnel. This method restores the meniscus root, allowing it to withstand hoop stress. Our technique uses a disposable root repair kit that includes a FlipCutter, a Knee Scorpion Suture Passer, a 4.75-mm SwiveLock anchor tap, a SutureLasso, a PassPort Cannula, 0 FiberLink sutures, and TigerLink sutures.",2020,Arthroscopy Techniques
Sequence variability of Grapevine Rupestris stem pitting-associated virus in Washington state vineyards,"Introduction Washington state ranks second, after California, in wine grape acreage and production in the USA. Among the several viruses documented worldwide on grapevines (Martelli, 2000), Grapevine leafrollassociated virus-1, -2, -3, -4, -5, and -9 and Grapevine Rupestris stem pitting-associated virus (GRSPaV) have so far been documented in WA vineyards (Martin et al., 2005; Naidu et al., 2006). GRSPaV (family Flexiviridae, genus Foveavirus) is closely associated with the Rupestris stem pitting (RSP) disease of the Rugose Wood complex and prevalent in many viticulture regions (Minafra and Boscia, 2003). Although GRSPaV has been removed from the list of quarantine pests in WA, it is still a controlled pest in the state certification program. Since wine grape cultivars are largely grown in WA as own-rooted vines, GRSPaV may not show obvious symptoms in these cultivars. Thus, own-rooted vines may carry the virus as symptomless infections. Therefore, an understanding of the prevalence of GRSPaV in WA vineyards is valuable in maintaining the sanitary status of WA vineyards.",2007,

"A new cheirolepidiaceous conifer from the Early Jurassic of the Junggar Basin, northern Xinjiang and its paleoclimatic implications","Abstract Messozoic sediments are extensively developed in the vast area of Xinjiang and Jurassic strata arte well exposed in the Junggare Basin. The Haojiagou geological section naer Uruqi in the south of the basin is a typical section for the lower Jurassic Badaowan and Sangonghe formations. The cheirolepidiaceous conifer brachphyllum (Hirmeriella?) sp., which exhibits strongly xeromorphic characters, was discovered in the Sangonghe Formation and is associated with a high relative abundance (up to 75%) of dispersed classopollis pollen. The occurrence of cheirolepidiaceous foliage and Classopollis pollen in the Sangfonghe Formation indicates that a warm and dry climate prevailed in the Junggar Basin during the Early Jurassic (Early toarcian), supporting the hypothesis for a warming event at that time.

Principal Component Regression by Principal Component Selection,"Abstract We propose a selection procedure of principal components in principal component regression. Our methodselects principal components using variable selection procedures instead of a small subset of major principalcomponents in principal component regression. Our procedure consists of two steps to improve estimation andprediction. First, we reduce the number of principal components using the conventional principal componentregression to yield the set of candidate principal components and then select principal components among thecandidate set using sparse regression techniques. The performance of our proposals is demonstrated numericallyand compared with the typical dimension reduction approaches (including principal component regression andpartial least square regression) using synthetic and real datasets.Keywords: Biased estimation, dimension reduction, penalized regression, principal componentregression, principal component selection. 1. Introduction Regression model is a popular statistical model for data analysis. Under fairly general conditions,the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator of the regression model has many desirable properties,including unbiasedness and minimum variance. Multicollinearity deteriorates OLS estimator quality.Multicollinearity often arises in many real-world applications where the set of explanatory variableshas the nearly linear dependence or the sample size is smaller than the variable size. Two types ofbias estimation are widely used to address such situation. One of them is regularization method,where model parameters are selected under a certain constraint. Popular regularization methods forregressionareridgeregression,Lasso,andotherpenalizedregressionmethods. Theotherisdimensionreductionmethods(suchasprincipalcomponentregression(PCR)andpartialleastsquaresregression(PLSR)) where explanatory variable space is decomposed into orthogonal directions and only someof them are used for model building. Both of approaches produce biased estimators, but often have asmaller variance than OLS estimators. This property (incurring bias and reducing variance) improvesestimation and prediction, and this is the reason why biased estimation methods are popular.

High-Dimensional Semiparametric Selection Models: Estimation Theory with an Application to the Retail Gasoline Market,"This paper proposes a multi-stage projection-based Lasso procedure for the semiparametric sample selection model in high-dimensional settings under a weak nonparametric restriction on the selection correction. In particular, the number of regressors in the main equation, p, and the number of regressors in the selection equation, d, can grow with and exceed the sample size n. The analysis considers the exact sparsity case and the approximate sparsity case. The main theoretical results are finite-sample bounds from which sufficient scaling conditions on the sample size for estimation consistency and variable-selection consistency are established. Statistical efficiency of the proposed estimators is studied via lower bounds on minimax risks and the result shows that, for a family of models with exactly sparse structure on the coefficient vector in the main equation, one of the proposed estimators attains the smallest estimation error up to the (n,d,p)-scaling among a class of procedures in worst-case scenarios. Inference procedures for the coefficients of the main equation, one based on a pivotal Dantzig selector to construct non-asymptotic confidence sets and one based on a post-selection strategy, are discussed. Other theoretical contributions include establishing the non-asymptotic counterpart of the familiar asymptotic oracle results from previous literature: the estimator of the coefficients in the main equation behaves as if the unknown nonparametric component were known, provided the nonparametric component is sufficiently smooth. Small-sample performance of the high-dimensional multi-stage estimation procedure is evaluated by Monte-Carlo simulations and illustrated with an empirical application to the retail gasoline market in the Greater Saint Louis area.",2014,arXiv: Statistics Theory

Bayesian analysis of penalized quantile regression for longitudinal data,This paper considers penalized quantile regression model for random effects longitudinal data from a Bayesian perspective. The introduction of a large number of individual random effects can significantly inflate the variability of estimates of other covariate effects. To modify this inflation effect a hierarchical Bayesian model is introduced to shrink the individual effects toward the common population values by using the Lasso and adaptive Lasso penalties in the quantile regression check function. A Gibbs sampling algorithm is developed to simulate the parameters from the posterior distributions. The simulation studies and real data analysis indicate that the proposed methods generally perform better in comparison to the other approaches.,2017,Statistical Papers

The Lassoing Rhetoric venture is interesting for its multifaceted approach to linguistic devices, prominently including rhetorical figures, but also RST relations and stylistic models, like the use of historic present. This application takes a natural language text input and uses syntactic parsing tools to produce a knowledge base of linguistic entities using references to an OWL ontological framework, locating these devices using Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) logic rules.

CMEP: a database for circulating microRNA expression profiling,"Motivation
In recent years, several experimental studies have revealed that the microRNAs (miRNAs) in serum, plasma, exosome, and whole blood are dysregulated in various types of diseases, indicating that the circulating miRNAs may serve as potential noninvasive biomarkers for disease diagnosis and prognosis. However, no database has been constructed to integrate the large-scale circulating miRNA profiles, explore the functional pathways involved, and predict the potential biomarkers using feature selection between the disease conditions. Although there have been several studies attempting to generate a circulating miRNA database, they have not yet integrated the large-scale circulating miRNA profiles or provided the biomarker-selection function using machine learning methods.


Results
To fill this gap, we constructed the Circulating MicroRNA Expression Profiling (CMEP) database for integrating, analyzing, and visualizing the large-scale expression profiles of phenotype-specific circulating miRNAs. The CMEP database contains massive datasets that were manually curated from NCBI GEO and the exRNA Atlas, including 66 datasets, 228 subsets, and 10,419 samples. The CMEP provides the differential expression circulating miRNAs analysis and the KEGG functional pathway enrichment analysis. Furthermore, to provide the function of noninvasive biomarker discovery, we implemented several feature-selection methods, including ridge regression, lasso regression, support vector machine, and random forests. Finally, we implemented a user-friendly web interface to improve the user experience and to visualize the data and results of CMEP.

"Home environmental and lifestyle factors associated with asthma, rhinitis and wheeze in children in Beijing, China.","BACKGROUND
The prevalence of asthma and allergic diseases has increased rapidly in urban China since 2000. There has been limited study of associations between home environmental and lifestyle factors with asthma and symptoms of allergic disease in China.


METHODS
In a cross-sectional analysis of 2214 children in Beijing, we applied a two-step hybrid Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) algorithm to identify environmental and lifestyle-related factors associated with asthma, rhinitis and wheeze from a wide range of candidates. We used group LASSO to select variables, using cross-validation as the criterion. Effect estimates were then calculated using adaptive LASSO. Model performance was assessed using Area Under the Curve (AUC) values.


RESULTS
We found a number of environmental and lifestyle-related factors significantly associated with asthma, rhinitis or wheeze, which changed the probability of asthma, rhinitis or wheeze fromÂ -5.76% (95%CI:Â -7.74%,Â -3.79%) to 27.4% (95%CI: 16.6%, 38.3%). The three factors associated with the largest change in probability of asthma were short birth length, carpeted floor and paternal allergy; for rhinitis they were maternal smoking during pregnancy, paternal allergy and living close to industrial area; and for wheeze they were carpeted floor, short birth length and maternal allergy. Other home environmental risk factors identified were living close to a highway, industrial area or river, sharing bedroom, cooking with gas, furry pets, cockroaches, incense, printer/photocopier, TV, damp, and window condensation in winter. Lifestyle-related risk factors were child caretakers other than parents, and age<3 for the day-care. Other risk factors included use of antibiotics, and mother's occupation. Major protective factors for wheeze were living in a rural/suburban region, air conditioner use, and mother's occupation in healthcare.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings suggest that changes in lifestyle and indoor environments associated with the urbanization and industrialization of China are associated with asthma, rhinitis, and wheeze in children.",2019,Environmental pollution
Sparse representation classification over discriminatively learned dictionary for language recognition,"In conventional dictionary learning, the class label of the atoms is not retained. As a result of that, the location of non-zeros elements in the sparse vector (s-vector) does not infer about the true class of the test vector unlike the sparse representation classification (SRC) over the exemplar dictionary. Thus, in our earlier works employing the learned dictionary for language recognition (LR), the s-vectors are required to be processed for classification. In this work, we explore SRC over discriminative learned dictionary for LR. For this purpose, the language-specific training i-vectors are used to create the language-specific learned dictionary. These language-specific dictionaries are then concatenated to form a composite discriminative dictionary. For sparse coding, the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and elastic net (ENet) algorithms are explored. The regularized multiclass logistic regression is employed for score calibration. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated on NIST 2009 language recognition evaluation data set in closed set condition on 30 seconds duration segments.",2017,TENCON 2017 - 2017 IEEE Region 10 Conference
Anterior Cruciate Ligament Remnant e Preserving Reconstruction Using a â€œ Lasso-Loop â€ Knot Con fi guration,"Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture predisposes to altered kinematics and possible knee joint degeneration. Graft fiber maturation and ligamentization may eliminate this risk during ACL reconstruction procedures. ACL remnantesparing techniques support the theory that the preserved tissue enhances revascularization, preserves the mechanoreceptors, and leads to anatomic remodeling. The purpose of this article is to present a simple and reproducible technique of tensioning the preserved ACL remnant over the femur. A nonabsorbable suture is passed through the ACL remnant with a â€œlasso-loopâ€ technique using a curved rotator cuff hook. Femoral and tibial tunnel preparation is performed according to a standard surgical technique for the EndoButton device (Smith & Nephew Endoscopy, Andover, MA). The free ends of the ACL remnant suture are retrieved through the tibial tunnel and passed through each outside hole of the EndoButton device. The hamstring graft is passed through the tibial and femoral tunnels and fixed to the femoral cortex by flipping the EndoButton and to the tibia by an interference screw. Finally, non-sliding half-stitch locking knots are made to secure the ACL remnant suture on the EndoButton device, by use of a knot pusher. This technique offers simple and secure tensioning of the ACL remnant on the fixation device. nterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture is one of Athe most common knee injuries, predisposing to altered knee kinematics, loss of neuromuscular feedback, increased medial compartment contact, and shear forces. In an effort to decelerate this degenerative process, arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) using tendon autografts has been one of the most popular surgical interventions worldwide. However, despite the numerous surgical techniques described, ACLR improves the patientâ€™s activity level and reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of joint degeneration and the necessity for further surgery. Restoration of normal ACL anatomy requires anatomic remodeling, fiber maturation, and ligamentization of the applied graft.

Neutrino astrophysics and SN 1987 A(*)(**),"SummaryIn this paper we summarize the Mont Blanc observation of the Large Magellanic Cloud supernova, exploded on February 23, 1987. The problem of two bursts, recorded in different underground detectors and separated in time by 4.7 hours, is also discussed. Since the different observations are not contradictory from the experimental point of view, some changements are required in the current predictions of the theoretical models of a gravitational stellar collapse in order to fit all the experimental data. Finally, the combined analysis of the data, recorded in all the neutrino and gravitational wave detectors running at the time of the supernova, clearly indicates a long duration of the phenomenon. Thus, any serious (even if difficult) tentative to explain how a star ends its life as a supernova should be based on all the experimental data available, recorded in different, independent experiments running at intercontinental distances at the time of supernova 1987 A.RiassuntoIn questo articolo si riassume l'osservazione al Monte Bianco della supernova della grande nube di Magellano esplosa il 23 Febbraio 1987.

Better prediction by use of co-data: adaptive group-regularized ridge regression.,"For many high-dimensional studies, additional information on the variables, like (genomic) annotation or external p-values, is available. In the context of binary and continuous prediction, we develop a method for adaptive group-regularized (logistic) ridge regression, which makes structural use of such 'co-data'. Here, 'groups' refer to a partition of the variables according to the co-data. We derive empirical Bayes estimates of group-specific penalties, which possess several nice properties: (i) They are analytical. (ii) They adapt to the informativeness of the co-data for the data at hand. (iii) Only one global penalty parameter requires tuning by cross-validation. In addition, the method allows use of multiple types of co-data at little extra computational effort. We show that the group-specific penalties may lead to a larger distinction between 'near-zero' and relatively large regression parameters, which facilitates post hoc variable selection. The method, termed GRridge, is implemented in an easy-to-use R-package. It is demonstrated on two cancer genomics studies, which both concern the discrimination of precancerous cervical lesions from normal cervix tissues using methylation microarray data. For both examples, GRridge clearly improves the predictive performances of ordinary logistic ridge regression and the group lasso. In addition, we show that for the second study, the relatively good predictive performance is maintained when selecting only 42 variables.",2016,Statistics in medicine
Identifying RNA Biomarkers for Oesophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma,"It is challenging to predict patient's prognosis in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (abbreviated to OSCC) or perform early intervention and prevention for this disease. With the development of clinical genomics, genetic heterogeneity in tumors was found to be relevant to OSCC tumorigenesis in precision medicine studies. Over the past decade, global microarray expression profiling has been used to investigate biomarkers for human diseases. In this study, we proposed two computational strategies for identifying RNA biomarkers from microarray expression profiles of OSCC. Firstly, the logistic regression model with a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regularization was used to analyze RNA expression profiles from OSCC tissues. Secondly, differential expression analysis for lncRNA profiles from both tumor and the corresponding para-cancerous tissues was performed to identify biomarkers related with lymph node metastasis, which might contribute to the early diagnosis and treatment of the disease.",2019,Studies in health technology and informatics
"A study in the commedia dell'arte, 1560-1620 : with special reference to the visual records","Italian comedians attracted audiences to performances at every level, from the magnificent Italian, German and French court festival appearances of Orlando di Lasso or Isabella Andreini, to the humble street trestle lazzi of anonymous quacks. The characters they inspired continue to exercise a profound cultural influence, and an understanding of the commedia dell'arte and its visual record is fundamental for scholars of post-1550 European drama, literature, art, and music. The 340 plates presented here are considered in the light of the rise and spread of commedia stock types, and especially Harlequin, Zanni and the actresses. Intensively researched in public and private collections in Oxford, Munich, Florence, Venice, Paris and elsewhere, they complement the familiar images of Jacques Callot and the Stockholm 'Recueil Fossard' within a framework of hundreds of significant pictures still virtually unknown in this context. These range from anonymous popular prints to pictures by artists such as Ambrogio Brambilla, Sebastian Vrancx, Jan Bruegel, Louis de Caulery, Marten de Vos, and members of the Valckenborch and Francken clans. This volume, essential for commedia dell'arte specialists, represents an invaluable reference resource for scholars, students, theatre practitioners and artists concerned with commedia-related aspects of visual, dramatic and festival culture, in and beyond Italy.",1995,
Expectation-Maximization Gaussian-Mixture Approximate Message Passing,"When recovering a sparse signal from noisy compressive linear measurements, the distribution of the signal's non-zero coefficients can have a profound effect on recovery mean-squared error (MSE). If this distribution was a priori known, then one could use computationally efficient approximate message passing (AMP) techniques for nearly minimum MSE (MMSE) recovery. In practice, however, the distribution is unknown, motivating the use of robust algorithms like LASSO-which is nearly minimax optimal-at the cost of significantly larger MSE for non-least-favorable distributions. As an alternative, we propose an empirical-Bayesian technique that simultaneously learns the signal distribution while MMSE-recovering the signal-according to the learned distribution-using AMP. In particular, we model the non-zero distribution as a Gaussian mixture and learn its parameters through expectation maximization, using AMP to implement the expectation step. Numerical experiments on a wide range of signal classes confirm the state-of-the-art performance of our approach, in both reconstruction error and runtime, in the high-dimensional regime, for most (but not all) sensing operators.",2013,IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing
Model selection in quantile regression models,"Lasso methods are regularisation and shrinkage methods widely used for subset selection and estimation in regression problems. From a Bayesian perspective, the Lasso-type estimate can be viewed as a Bayesian posterior mode when specifying independent Laplace prior distributions for the coefficients of independent variables [32]. A scale mixture of normal priors can also provide an adaptive regularisation method and represents an alternative model to the Bayesian Lasso-type model. In this paper, we assign a normal prior with mean zero and unknown variance for each quantile coefficient of independent variable. Then, a simple Markov Chain Monte Carlo-based computation technique is developed for quantile regression (QReg) models, including continuous, binary and left-censored outcomes. Based on the proposed prior, we propose a criterion for model selection in QReg models. The proposed criterion can be applied to classical least-squares, classical QReg, classical Tobit QReg and many others. For example, the proposed criterion can be applied to rq(), lm() and crq() which is available in an R package called Brq. Through simulation studies and analysis of a prostate cancer data set, we assess the performance of the proposed methods. The simulation studies and the prostate cancer data set analysis confirm that our methods perform well, compared with other approaches.",2015,Journal of Applied Statistics
Seismic catastrophes at the ancient city of Sagalassos (SW Turkey) and their implications for seismotectonics in the Burdurâ€“Isparta area,"The ancient city of Sagalassos, situated c. 10â€‰km south of Isparta (SW Turkey), is located on the southeastern outskirts of an area affected by a number of large earthquakes (Ms > 6.0) in the last century, and where a number of seismogenic faults are identified. Archaeological relics at Sagalassos show ample evidence that the city experienced severe earthquake damage early in the sixth century AD and in the middle of the seventh century AD. This last seismic catastrophe even seems to have caused the abandonment of the city. It is postulated that the city was situated in the macroseismic epicentre, although the causative fault has not yet been identified. Based on satellite imagery, and both geological and geomorphological field evidence in the region of Sagalassos, NEâ€“SW-trending and ENEâ€“WSW-trending tectonic lines are considered as candidates for the seismogenic faults that caused the devastating earthquakes.

Fast Identification of Biological Pathways Associated with a Quantitative Trait Using Group Lasso with Overlaps,"Where causal SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) tend to accumulate within biological pathways, the incorporation of prior pathways information into a statistical model is expected to increase the power to detect true associations in a genetic association study. Most existing pathways-based methods rely on marginal SNP statistics and do not fully exploit the dependence patterns among SNPs within pathways.We use a sparse regression model, with SNPs grouped into pathways, to identify causal pathways associated with a quantitative trait. Notable features of our Â“pathways group lasso with adaptive weightsÂ” (P-GLAW) algorithm include the incorporation of all pathways in a single regression model, an adaptive pathway weighting procedure that accounts for factors biasing pathway selection, and the use of a bootstrap sampling procedure for the ranking of important pathways. P-GLAW takes account of the presence of overlapping pathways and uses a novel combination of techniques to optimise model estimation, making it fast to run, even on whole genome datasets.In a comparison study with an alternative pathways method based on univariate SNP statistics, our method demonstrates high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of important pathways, showing the greatest relative gains in performance where marginal SNP effect sizes are small.",2012,Statistical Applications in Genetics and Molecular Biology

Photoacoustic generation by a gold nanosphere: from the linear to the nonlinear thermoelastic regime,"We theoretically investigate the photoacoustic generation by a gold nanosphere in water in the thermoelastic regime. Photoacoustic signals are predicted computed based on the successive resolution of a thermal diffusion problem and a thermoelastic problem, taking into account the finite size of the gold nanosphere, thermoelastic and elastic properties of both water and gold, and the temperature-dependence of the thermal expansion coefficient of water. For sufficiently high illumination fluences, this temperature dependence yields a nonlinear relationship between the photoacoustic amplitude and the fluence. For nanosecond pulses in the linear regime, we show that more than 90% of the emitted photoacoustic energy is generated in water, and the thickness of the generating layer around the particle scales close to the square root of the pulse duration. The amplitude of the photoacoustic waves in the linear regime are accurately predicted by the point-absorber model introduced by Calasso and Diebold, but our results demonstrate that this model significantly overestimates the amplitude of photoacoustic waves in the nonlinear regime. We therefore provide quantitative estimates of a critical energy, defined as the absorbed energy required such that the nonlinear contribution is equal to that of the linear contribution. Our results suggest that the critical energy scales as the volume of water over which heat diffuses during the illumination pulse. Moreover, thermal nonlinearity are shown to be expected only for sufficiently high ultrasound frequency. Finally, we show that the relationship between the photoacoustic amplitude and the equilibrium temperature at sufficiently high fluence reflects the thermal diffusion at the nanoscale around the gold nanosphere.",2015,arXiv: Optics
Collasso di un manufatto in calcestruzzo: analisi con la Meccanica della Frattura = Collapse of a concrete artefact: analysis with the Fracture Mechanics,"Lâ€™oggetto di questa tesi riguarda principalmente lo studio della tipologia di frattura che ha causato il collasso delle strutture interessate dai lavori di manutenzione di un Progetto Esecutivo posto a base di gara dâ€™appalto e che ha comportato un infortunio mortale per due dipendenti della ditta esecutrice dei lavori citati. Il collasso in questione, come confermato dalle indagini, e avvenuto per rottura del calcestruzzo delle strutture coinvolte. In letteratura sono presenti numerose teorie che permettono di studiare la propagazione della frattura allâ€™interno di un materiale. Lâ€™impiego di una teoria rispetto ad un'altra dipende da molti fattori, tra i quali vi e il materiale costituente il corpo entro il quale la frattura si propaga. Nella fattispecie, lâ€™approccio intrapreso per studiare il problema e lo studio della frattura nel supporto in calcestruzzo mediante la teoria della Meccanica della Frattura Elastica Lineare. Il modello che meglio si presta allo studio di problemi di propagazione della frattura in materiali quasi-fragili come il calcestruzzo, e il Modello di Westergaard, anche detto Modello dei potenziali complessi, sul quale si basa la Teoria di Irwin degli anni â€™50 che fonde assieme sia lâ€™aspetto tensionale che quello energetico riguardo il processo di formazione e dellâ€™avanzamento dei difetti nei materiali. Piu nel dettaglio, anche in considerazione del connubio rilevato tra la sollecitazione agente e la limitata superficie di contatto in cui essa viene esplicata, si e studiato il problema in oggetto implementando il Modello di Westergaard per sollecitazione agente di Taglio o scorrimento sul piano, ovvero in Modo II. Preliminarmente allo studio vero e proprio della propagazione secondo i metodi della Meccanica della Frattura, si e pertanto definita la reale geometria del problema, quella interessata dalla rottura; la resistenza del materiale coinvolto, il calcestruzzo; e le azioni effettivamente agenti al momento del collasso. Al fine di validare il modello impiegato si e poi studiata la frattura per Modo Misto mediante il Criterio di Diramazione, utile per lo studio dellâ€™interazione tra i Modi I e II di sollecitazione. Dallâ€™analisi dellâ€™implementazione eseguita e risultata la veridicita della modalita di sollecitazione ipotizzata di puro Modo II. In conclusione, dalle ricostruzioni e i calcoli effettuati, il risultato piu importante a cui si e giunti dimostra come il collasso non e avvenuto tanto per il superamento della resistenza a taglio del calcestruzzo, quanto per la propagazione fragile della fessura. Cio avvalora la corretta applicazione del modello di meccanica della frattura elastica lineare in Modo II, che mette in evidenza la caratterizzazione fragile del collasso. In parallelo alla trattazione riportata sopra, si illustrano alcune considerazioni di interesse ingegneristico circa la gestione del cantiere in oggetto e la sicurezza in fase di progetto ed esecuzione, con specifico riferimento alle normative vigenti e alla definizione di ambiente confinato.",2018,

Under partial faithfulness, we develop a simplified version of the pc algorithm (Spirtes et al., 2000), which is computationally feasible even with thousands of covariates and provides consistent variable selection under conditions on the random design matrix that are of a different nature than coherence conditions for penalty-based approaches like the lasso. Simulations and application to real data show that our method is competitive compared to penalty-based approaches. We provide an efficient implementation of the algorithm in the R-package pcalg.

Specifically, he claims that mathematics is capable of disclosing the primary qualities of any object: â€œall those aspects of the ob-ject that can be formulated in mathematical terms can be meaningfully conceived as properties of the object in itself.â€ Here we will use Bungeâ€™s philosophy of mathematics in order to challenge the preceding assumption.",2019,Metascience
Decal-Lenses: Interactive Lenses on Surfaces for Multivariate Visualization,"We present decal-lenses, a new interaction technique that extends the concept of magic lenses to augment and manage multivariate visualizations on arbitrary surfaces. Our object-space lenses follow the surface geometry and allow the user to change the point of view during data exploration while maintaining a spatial reference to positions where one or more lenses were placed. Each lens delimits specific regions of the surface where one or more attributes can be selected or combined. Similar to 2D lenses, the user interacts with our lenses in real-time, switching between different attributes within the lens context. The user can also visualize the surface data representations from the point of view of each lens by using local cameras. To place lenses on surfaces of intricate geometry, such as the human brain, we introduce the concept of support surfaces for designing interaction techniques. Support surfaces provide a way to place and interact with the lenses while avoiding holes and occluded regions during data exploration. We further extend decal-lenses to arbitrary regions using brushing and lassoing operations. We discuss the applicability of our technique and present several examples where our lenses can be useful to create a customized exploration of multivariate data on surfaces.",2019,IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics

Localized Lasso for High-Dimensional Regression,"We introduce the localized Lasso, which is suited for learning models that are both interpretable and have a high predictive power in problems with high dimensionality $d$ and small sample size $n$. More specifically, we consider a function defined by local sparse models, one at each data point. We introduce sample-wise network regularization to borrow strength across the models, and sample-wise exclusive group sparsity (a.k.a., $\ell_{1,2}$ norm) to introduce diversity into the choice of feature sets in the local models. The local models are interpretable in terms of similarity of their sparsity patterns. The cost function is convex, and thus has a globally optimal solution. Moreover, we propose a simple yet efficient iterative least-squares based optimization procedure for the localized Lasso, which does not need a tuning parameter, and is guaranteed to converge to a globally optimal solution. The solution is empirically shown to outperform alternatives for both simulated and genomic personalized medicine data.",2017,

Bayesian adaptive lassos with non-convex penalization,"The lasso (Tibshirani,1996) has sparked interest in the use of penalization of 
the log-likelihood for variable selection, as well as shrinkage. Recently, there have 
been attempts to propose penalty functions which improve upon the Lassos properties 
for variable selection and prediction, such as SCAD (Fan and Li, 2001) and 
the Adaptive Lasso (Zou, 2006). We adopt the Bayesian interpretation of the Lasso 
as the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the regression coefficients, which 
have been given independent, double exponential prior distributions. Generalizing 
this prior provides a family of adaptive lasso penalty functions, which includes the quasi-cauchy distribution (Johnstone and Silverman, 2005) as a special case. 
The properties of this approach are explored. We are particularly interested in the 
more variables than observations case of characteristic importance for data arising 
in chemometrics, genomics and proteomics - to name but three. Our methodology 
can give rise to multiple modes of the posterior distribution and we show how 
this may occur even with the convex lasso. These multiple modes do no more 
than reflect the indeterminacy of the model. We give fast algorithms and suggest 
a strategy of using a set of perfectly fitting random starting values to explore 
different regions of the parameter space with substantial posterior support. Simulations 
show that our procedure provides significant improvements on a range of 
established procedures and we provide an example from chemometrics.",2007,
"Seagrass Distribution, Composition and Abundance Along the Saudi Arabian Coast of Red Sea","Seagrasses rank among the most productive ecosystems with important implications in climate change mitigation. Tropical and subtropical seas hold the largest seagrass species richness. A total of 12 different seagrass species have been reported from the Red Sea. However, there is little information on seagrass diversity and distribution along the Saudi Arabian coast of the Red Sea. This study aims to capture: (i) the distribution and composition of seagrasses from 18Â°N to 28Â°N latitudes on a broader scale, and (ii) the species composition, distribution and abundance of seagrasses by detailed investigations at three locations along the Saudi Arabian coast: Sharma, Umluj and Jazan, representing the northern, central and southern Red Sea. The most commonly observed seagrass species along the Red Sea were Halodule uninervis (17 observations), Thalassia hemprichii (13 observations) and Halophila stipulacea (11 observations). Halophila stipulacea was the most dominant species at each of the three locations studied in more detail. Syringodium isoetifolium and Thalassodendron ciliatum were found only at Umluj, while H. ovalis and T. hemprichii were found only at Jazan. H. uninervis was observed at both Umluj and Jazan. Shoot lengths of H. stipulacea and H. uninervis showed significant differences among the three locations. The average above-ground biomass of seagrasses differed significantly among locations (analysis <0.05; multiple tests), with the highest biomass for Halophila stipulacea recorded at Jazan (81 Â± 24 gDW mâˆ’2) and an average biomass for T. ciliatum of 74 Â± 16 gDW mâˆ’2 at Umluj. The species T. ciliatum was the only taxa that exhibited significant differences (p < 0.05) in the abundance of seagrasses among the three locations. This work contributes further to our understanding of the distribution and diversity of seagrasses in the Red Sea, confirming a high seagrass richness with at least ten different species along the Saudi Arabian coast of the Red Sea.",2019,
IRGS: an immune-related gene classifier for lung adenocarcinoma prognosis,"BACKGROUND
Tumour cells interfere with normal immune functions by affecting the expression of some immune-related genes, which play roles in the prognosis of cancer patients. In recent years, immunotherapy for tumours has been widely studied, but a practical prognostic model based on immune-related genes in lung adenocarcinoma comparable to existing model has not been established and reported.


METHODS
We first obtained publicly accessible lung adenocarcinoma RNA expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) for differential gene expression analysis and then filtered immune-related genes based on the ImmPort database. By using the lasso algorithm and multivariate Cox Proportional-Hazards (CoxPH) regression analysis, we identified candidate genes for model development and validation. The robustness of the model was further examined by comparing the model with three established gene models.


RESULTS
Gene expression data from a total of 524 lung adenocarcinoma patients from TCGA were used for model development. We identified four biomarkers (MAP3K8, CCL20, VEGFC, and ANGPTL4) that could predict overall survival in lung adenocarcinoma (HRâ€‰=â€‰1.98, 95% CI 1.48 to 2.64, Pâ€‰=â€‰4.19e-06) and this model could be used as a classifier for the evaluation of low-risk and high-risk groups. This model was validated with independent microarray data and was highly comparable with previously reported gene expression signatures for lung adenocarcinoma prognosis.


CONCLUSIONS
In this study, we identified a practical and robust four-gene prognostic model based on an immune gene dataset with cross-platform compatibility. This model has potential value in improving TNM staging for survival predictions in patients with lung adenocarcinoma.


IMPACT
The study provides a method of immune relevant gene prognosis model and the identification of immune gene classifier for the prediction of lung adenocarcinoma prognosis with RNA sequencing and microarray compatibility.",2020,Journal of Translational Medicine

Regional differences in duration of the planktonic larval stage of reef fishes in the eastern Pacific Ocean,"Regional variation in the duration of the planktonic larval phase of three species of reef fishes, Thalassoma lucasanum (Labridae), Stegastes flavilatus, and Microspathodon dorsalis (Pomacentridae) was investigated between 1982 and 1991 at several sites in the tropical eastern Pacific over a distance of 3500 km, encompassing virtually their entire range of distribution. Durations of the larval phase, determined from counts of daily otolith increments, were significantly different (1.3 to 1.6 x) between sites. Populations of all three species had a consistently shorter larval life at the most northern site, Cabo San Lucas (Mexico) compared to PanamÃ¡ and the offshore islands of GalÃ¡pagos and Cocos. Analyses of otolith increment width over the precompetent period revealed that this disparity in larval duration primarily reflected differences in larval growth rates: faster growing fish spent less time in the plankton. In T. lucasanum, some of the variation in larval duration between PanamÃ¡ and offshore sites (GalÃ¡pagos Islands and Cocos Island) may be accounted for by a higher frequency of individuals delaying metamorphosis at the offshore sites. These data indicate that conditions in the planktonic environment are not homogeneous throughout the tropical eastern Pacific and may have a profound effect on aspects of the larval ecology of reef fishes in this region.",1992,Marine Biology

General performance metrics for the LASSO,"A recent line of work has established accurate predictions of the mean squared-error (MSE) performance of non-smooth convex optimization methods when used to recover structured signals (e.g. sparse, low-rank) from noisy linear (and possibly compressed) observations. Specifically, in a recent paper [15] we precisely characterized the MSE performance of a general class of regularized M-estimators using a framework that is based on Gaussian process methods. Here, we extend the framework to the analysis of a general class of Lipschitz performance metrics, which in addition to the standard MSE, includes the â„“1-reconstruction error, the probability of successfully identifying whether an element belongs to the support of a sparse signal, the empirical distribution of the error, etc. For concreteness, we primarily focus on the problem of sparse recovery under â„“1-regularized least-squares (aka LASSO). We illustrate the validity of the theoretical predictions through numerical simulations and discuss the importance of their precise nature in optimally tuning the involved parameters of the reconstruction method.",2016,2016 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW)
Aero-thermo-elastic methods for the analysis of a hypersonic deployable aerodynamic decelerator,"La tesi si e concentra sulla ricerca e lo sviluppo di adeguate metodologie di calcolo aero-termo-dinamiche e aero-elastiche non-lineari al fine di indagare nuove configurazioni strutturali e tecnologie per lo studio di capsule dispiegabili per il rientro atmosferico e l'esplorazione planetaria in configurazione â€œumbrella-likeâ€.
A tal fine, sono state prese in considerazione diverse configurazioni di capsule dispiegabili e diverse condizioni d'ingresso supersoniche / ipersoniche, al fine di dimostrare la bonta di una configurazione flessibile del tipo ""umbrella-like"" per essere utilizzata come Thermal Protection System (TPS), invece delle attuali capsule per il rientro atmosferico che montano uno schermo termico fisso.
Nel lavoro di tesi sono presentati studi su software commerciali (strutturali e fluido dinamici) e lo sviluppo di strumenti analitici aeroelastici.
Lo studio preliminare sulla traiettoria di immissione in atmosfera marziana su diversi landers del passato dimostrano che i carichi termici e dinamici agenti sullo scudo termico su una configurazione dispiegabile rispetto una configurazione con scudo fisso, possono essere ridotti da 2,5 a 3 volte.
Uno studio aero-termico basato sull'interazione dei software commerciali piu avanzati CFD e agli elementi finiti ha dimostrato che un approccio completamente accoppiato, fornisce i risultati piu accurati in termini di previsione della temperatura attraverso lo spessore del TPS.
Inoltre, e stato sviluppato e validato un modello analitico non lineare aero-elastico in grado di derivare le equazioni del moto usando un codice numerico basato sui modi naturali della struttura di un TPS utilizzando i risultati sperimentali e un modello agli elementi finiti. Tale modello ha dimostrato che questo semplice, ma abbastanza preciso, modello puo indagare diverse configurazioni strutturali in un breve lasso di tempo. Cio puo ridurre notevolmente i costi di progettazione, dando la possibilita di studiare una vasta gamma di configurazioni strutturali e condizioni prima delle prove sperimentali.
Anche se interessanti risultati sono stati raggiunti grazie alla ricerca e lo sviluppo di metodologie di calcolo di tali configurazioni, questo lavoro ha aperto la strada a nuovi studi e domande sul comportamento aero-termo-elastico del TPS in flusso ipersonico.",2017,
P1049: Non-REM sleep microstructures and phasic REM sleep events are associated with intracranial oxygenation changes measured with NIRS,"s of Poster Presentations / Clinical Neurophysiology 125, Supplement 1 (2014) S1â€“S339 S327 P1046 Data-driven modeling of sleep EEG and EOG reveals stages indicative of pre-Parkinson and Parkinsonâ€™s disease J.A.E.

Lundbeck A/S, Biostatistics, Valby, Denmark; 4H. Lundbeck A/S, Clinical Pharmacology, Valby, Denmark; 5University of Copenhagen, Center for Healthy Ageing, Copenhagen, Denmark Question: Will unsupervised modelling of sleep EOG and sleep EEG reveal sleep characteristica indicative of pre-Parkinson and Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD)? Methods: Polysomnographic (PSG) data from 10 age-matched control subjects were used to develop an EOG sleep model and an EEG sleep model. The sleep models were applied on full-night PSG data from 24 additional control subjects, 26 patients with periodic leg movements (PLM), 31 patients with idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) and 36 PD patients. Based on the data-driven sleep models, features reflecting sleep characteristics in the EEG and EOG activity were computed. The total amount of data was devided in a training dataset containing 16 subjects from each of the four groups, and a validation dataset containing the remaining subjects. The features derived were evaluated and the most discriminative ones between iRBD/PD (neurodegenerative diseases (NDD) cases) and PLM/controls (motor, but non-NDD cases) were found by training a Lasso regularized Regression model using eight-fold cross-validation on the training dataset. Results: The best classification model included four features derived from the EEG data, and the NDD patients in the validation dataset could be classified with a sensitivity of 91.4% and a specificity of 61.1%. The most discriminative features were found to be thresholded amounts and stability of EEG topics reflected to REM, N3 and N1/N2, respectively. Conclusions: This study suggests that the amount of N3 and R and the ability to maintain NREM and REM sleep determined by a data-driven sleep model can be used as potentially early PD biomarkers.

Leskelae2, E. Rauhala1 1Satakunta Central Hospital, Clinical Neurophysiology, Pori, Finland; 2Satakunta Central Hospital, Neurology, Pori, Finland Question: Are self-reported short and long term sleep quality related to the severity of sleep related breathing disturbances (SRBD) in ischemic stroke patients? Methods: In this pilot study, 23 patients with acute first-time stroke, admitted to the stroke unit, underwent overnight polygraphy during the first 72 h after admission. Nasal airflow, respiratory movements, snoring sound, oxygenation level, and ECG were recorded. The incidence of SRBD before the stroke was studied with a questionnaire regarding their sleep three months prior the stroke. The reported quality of sleep during the treatment period in stroke unit was examined with the visual scale questionnaire containing five questions. The severity of stroke was assessed with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and the ability to function with the Barthel Index. Results: Increased apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) was related to the increased amount of total sleep time during 24 hours (p=0.006). No association was found between AHI and the amount of sleep time during night. Also, no correlations between AHI and VAS questions were found. Increased AHI was related with lower Barthel Index (p=0.017) but not with NIHSS. Conclusions: SRBD as well as excessive daytime sleepiness are common findings in patients after stroke. In our study, stroke patients with increased AHI reported increased amount of sleep time during 24 h but not during night time regarding three months pre-stroke, suggesting that they are napping. SRBD negatively affect to the functional outcome after stroke. In addition, SRBD increases the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases, which in turn increases risk for stroke. It is suggested that early diagnosis and treatment of underlying SRBD improve both recovery from stroke in short term and reduce the risk of relapses in long term. Our preliminary results suggest that reported napping may be a marker for a potential SRBD in stroke patients.

Ilmoniemi2 1Helsinki University Hospital, Medical Imaging/Clin. Neurophys., Helsinki, Finland; 2Aalto University, BECS, Espoo, Finland Question: Disordered and fragmented sleep due to sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, and insomnia are associated with an increased risk of cardioand cerebrovascular morbidity. Autonomic activation and repetitive hypoxia are examples of possible mechanisms mediating this risk. In addition to sleep apnea episodes, non-apneic disruptions in sleep continuity are associated with transitory intracranial hypoxia measured with nearinfrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Some of the K-complexes are triggered by non-waking external auditory stimuli. Phasic rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep is associated with the activation of the autonomic nervous system and surges in systemic blood pressure. Are these sleep microstructural phenomena associated with changes in intracranial blood oxygenation? Methods: Six healthy volunteers were measured overnight with polysomnography and NIRS for extraand intracranial blood oxygenation changes. Sleep spindles, K-complexes, and bursts of eye movements in REM sleep were detected. Average temporal changes in oxyand deoxyhemoglobin triggered by these sleep events were measured. Results: K-complexes triggered short intracranial hemodynamic responses and spindels delayed and longer responses. During and after phasic events in REM sleep, there were transient changes in intracranial blood oxygenation. Conclusions: K-complexes are associated with transient hemodynamic changes in intracranial circulation, which can mediate harmful vascular effects during poor sleep due to noisy environments. Systemic blood pressure surges during phasic REM sleep are counteracted with vasoconstriction in cerebral arteries, leading to transient cerebral hypoperfusion and hypoxia episodes during REM sleep. This could be associated with an increased risk of stroke during early mornings. P1050 Neurophysiological testing of the upper airway in obstructive sleep apnea showing peripheral nervous lesions E.

"Investigation of tylosin in feed of feedlot cattle and effects on liver abscess prevalence, and fecal and soil microbiomes and resistomes.","Liver abscesses in feedlot cattle are detrimental to animal performance and economic return. Tylosin, a macrolide antibiotic, is used to reduce prevalence of liver abscesses, though there is variable efficacy among different groups of cattle. There is an increased importance in better understanding the etiology and pathogenesis of this condition because of growing concern over antibiotic resistance and increased scrutiny regarding use of antibiotics in food animal production. The objective of this study was to compare the microbiomes and antimicrobial resistance genes (resistomes) of feces of feedlot cattle administered or not administered tylosin and in their pen soil in three geographical regions with differing liver abscess prevalences. Cattle (total of 2,256) from three geographical regions were selected for inclusion based on dietary supplementation with tylosin (yes/no). Feces and pen soil samples were collected before harvest, and liver abscesses were identified at harvest. Shotgun and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing were used to evaluate the soil and feces. Microbiome and resistome composition of feces (as compared by UniFrac distances and Euclidian distances, respectively) did not differ (P > 0.05) among tylosin or no tylosin administered cattle. However, feedlot location was associated with differences (P â‰¤ 0.05) of resistomes and microbiomes. Using LASSO, a statistical model identified both fecal and soil microbial communities as predictive of liver abscess prevalence in pens. This model explained 75% of the variation in liver abscess prevalence, though a larger sample size would be needed to increase robustness of the model. These data suggest that tylosin exposure does not have a large impact on cattle resistomes or microbiomes; but instead, location of cattle production may be a stronger driver of both the resistome and microbiome composition of feces.",2019,Journal of animal science
"Estimation, Prediction and Inference for the Lasso Random Effects Model","Summary 
 
The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) can be formulated as a random effects model with an associated variance parameter that can be estimated with other components of variance. In this paper, estimation of the variance parameters is performed by means of an approximation to the marginal likelihood of the observed outcomes. The approximation is based on an alternative but equivalent formulation of the LASSO random effects model. Predictions can be made using point summaries of the predictive distribution of the random effects given the data with the parameters set to their estimated values. The standard LASSO method uses the mode of this distribution as the predictor. It is not the only choice, and a number of other possibilities are defined and empirically assessed in this article. The predictive mode is competitive with the predictive mean (best predictor), but no single predictor performs best across in all situations. Inference for the LASSO random effects is performed using predictive probability statements, which are more appropriate under the random effects formulation than tests of hypothesis.",2009,Australian & New Zealand Journal of Statistics
Distributed optimization and market analysis of networked systems,"In the interconnected world of today, large-scale multi-agent networked systems are ubiquitous. This thesis studies two classes of multi-agent systems, where each agent has local information and a local objective function. In the first class of systems, the agents are collaborative and the overall objective is to optimize the sum of local objective functions. This setup represents a general family of separable problems in large-scale multi-agent convex optimization systems, which includes the LASSO (Least-Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) and many other important machine learning problems. We propose fast fully distributed both synchronous and asynchronous ADMM (Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers) based methods. Both of the proposed algorithms achieve the best known rate of convergence for this class of problems, O(1/k), where k is the number of iterations. This rate is the first rate of convergence guarantee for asynchronous distributed methods solving separable convex problems. For the synchronous algorithm, we also relate the rate of convergence to the underlying network topology. The second part of the thesis focuses on the class of systems where the agents are only interested in their local objectives. In particular, we study the market interaction in the electricity market. Instead of the traditional supply-follow-demand approach, we propose and analyze a systematic multi-period market framework, where both (price-taking) consumers and generators locally respond to price. We show that this new market interaction at competitive equilibrium is efficient and the improvement in social welfare over the traditional market can be unbounded. The resulting system, however, may feature undesirable price and generation fluctuations, which imposes significant challenges in maintaining reliability of the electricity grid. We first establish that the two fluctuations are positively correlated. Then in order to reduce both fluctuations, we introduce an explicit penalty on the price fluctuation. The penalized problem is shown to be equivalent to the existing system with storage and can be implemented in a distributed way, where each agent locally responds to price. We analyze the connection between the size of storage, consumer utility function properties and generation fluctuation in two scenarios: when demand is inelastic, we can 3 explicitly characterize the optimal storage access policy and the generation fluctuation; when demand is elastic, the relationship between concavity and generation fluctuation is studied.

Filamentous thrombi during left-sided sheath-assisted catheter ablations.,"This editorial refers to â€˜Left atrial Lasso catheter thrombus aspirationâ€™ by D. Sorajja et al. , Europace 12(10):1506â€“1507. 

Sorajja et al .'s1 case report highlights the problem of thrombi developing during a complex left-sided procedure in conjunction with the use of long sheaths.

The dramatic growth in the number of catheter ablations for atrial fibrillation and other left atrial arrhythmias has brought into sharp focus the incidence of thrombo-embolic complications, most frequently cerebrovascular in nature. In a recent world-wide survey, cerebrovascular accidents including transient ischemic attacks and strokes were observed in 0.94% of patients.2 Typically, these embolic events may be the result of either dislodgement of a pre-existing intra-left atrial thrombus or the occurrence of air embolism or the generation of thrombus, coagulum, or char during the procedure. The probability of encountering a pre-existing thrombus in the left atrium can be diminished significantly by ensuring effective anticoagulation for 4â€“6 weeks leading up to the catheter intervention and excluding a transoesophageal echo detectable thrombus within the 24 h preceding the intervention. Despite an INR within the therapeutic range, the anti-thrombotic protection afforded by oral anticoagulants is unlikely to be 100% (more likely, 60â€“70%) and screening by transoesophageal echocardiography is a useful and effective second level of protection. During the procedure, air emboli can be easily prevented by adhering to basic â€¦

Predictive Modelling for Cardiovascular Disease Mortality in Intensive Care Units,"The study develops a prognostic model for the mortality prediction of patients with cardiovascular diseases in Intensive Care Units (ICUs). Using clinical data, physiological measurements and vital signs during the first 48-hour after their admissions, the model specified the patientsâ€™ death correlations therefrom identified high-risk patients and their survival probability. Cox Proportional Hazards model is used to classify the patients as dead or survival with the accuracy measured by Score 1â€”the minimum of sensitivity and positive predictivity-of 0.45, which is 1.5 times better than that of the baseline ICU scoring system. Meanwhile, Lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) removes redundant variables and Regression analysis estimates the patientsâ€™ death time. The model excels in clinical prediction in terms of good classification, hybrid usage of data analysis, machine learning and signal processing for more insightful extraction of clinical features. Furthermore, the fast response time and heterogeneous multivariate diagnosis in multidimensional dataspace, including temporal changes of time-variant physiological measurements proposed a effective solution for real-time ICU monitoring system. Ultimately, this work serves as a predictive indicator of patient status, helping physicians and clinicians get insight into each individual for the most optimal treatment and resources allocation.",2018,
Using penalized likelihood to select parameters in a random coefficients multinomial logit model,"The multinomial logit model with random coefficients is widely used in applied research. This paper is concerned with estimating a random coefficients logit model in which the distribution of each coefficient is characterized by finitely many parameters. Some of these parameters may be zero. The paper gives conditions under which with probability approaching 1 as the sample size approaches infinity, penalized maximum likelihood (PML) estimation with the adaptive LASSO (AL) penalty function distinguishes correctly between zero and non-zero parameters in a random coefficients logit model. If one or more parameters are zero, then PML with the AL penalty function often reduces the asymptotic mean-square estimation error of any continuously differentiable function of the modelâ€™s parameters, such as a market share or an elasticity. The paper describes a method for computing the PML estimates of a random coefficients logit model. It also presents the results of Monte Carlo experiments that illustrate the numerical performance of the PML estimates. Finally, it presents the results of PML estimation of a random coefficients logit model of choice among brands of butter and margarine in the British groceries market.",2018,
How Correlations Influence Lasso Prediction,"We study how correlations in the design matrix influence Lasso prediction. First, we argue that the higher the correlations, the smaller the optimal tuning parameter. This implies in particular that the standard tuning parameters, that do not depend on the design matrix, are not favorable. Furthermore, we argue that Lasso prediction works well for any degree of correlations if suitable tuning parameters are chosen. We study these two subjects theoretically as well as with simulations.",2013,IEEE Transactions on Information Theory
18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography (FDG-PET)-Radiomics of metastatic lymph nodes and primary tumor in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) â€“ A prospective externally validated study,"BACKGROUND
Lymph node stage prior to treatment is strongly related to disease progression and poor prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, few studies have investigated metabolic imaging features derived from pre-radiotherapy 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron-emission tomography (PET) of metastatic hilar/mediastinal lymph nodes (LNs). We hypothesized that these would provide complementary prognostic information to FDG-PET descriptors to only the primary tumor (tumor).


METHODS
Two independent cohorts of 262 and 50 node-positive NSCLC patients were used for model development and validation. Image features (i.e. Radiomics) including shape and size, first order statistics, texture, and intensity-volume histograms (IVH) (http://www.radiomics.io/) were evaluated by univariable Cox regression on the development cohort. Prognostic modeling was conducted with a 10-fold cross-validated least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), automatically selecting amongst FDG-PET-Radiomics descriptors from (1) tumor, (2) LNs or (3) both structures. Performance was assessed with the concordance-index. Development data are publicly available at www.cancerdata.org and Dryad (doi:10.5061/dryad.752153b).


RESULTS
Common SUV descriptors (maximum, peak, and mean) were significantly related to overall survival when extracted from LNs, as were LN volume and tumor load (summed tumor and LNs' volumes), though this was not true for either SUV metrics or tumor's volume. Feature selection exclusively from imaging information based on FDG-PET-Radiomics, exhibited performances of (1) 0.53 -external 0.54, when derived from the tumor, (2) 0.62 -external 0.56 from LNs, and (3) 0.62 -external 0.59 from both structures, including at least one feature from each sub-category, except IVH.


CONCLUSION
Combining imaging information based on FDG-PET-Radiomics features from tumors and LNs is desirable to achieve a higher prognostic discriminative power for NSCLC.",2018,PLoS ONE
Risikofaktoren fÃ¼r MRSA in der Tierproduktion â€“ eine Metaanalyse,"Nutztierassoziierte (â€žLivestock-associatedâ€œ, LA) MRSA wurden in den letzten Jahren vor allem in der Schweinehaltung nachgewiesen und in zahlreichen Studien beschrieben. Seit 2004 beim Schwein gefunden (Meemken et al. 2010), sind LA-MRSA inzwischen verbreitet in Europa, Nordamerika und auch Asien. LA-MRSA ist ein Zoonoseerreger, der bei Mensch und Tier uberwiegend als symptomloser Besiedler von Haut und Schleimhauten lebt, beim Menschen allerdings auch an unterschiedlichen Krankheitsgeschehen beteiligt sein kann (Kock et al. 2013). LA-MRSA kommen vor allem bei Tierhaltern und Veterinaren mit engem Kontakt zu Nutztieren vor. Um Gegenmasnahmen ergreifen zu konnen, ist es wichtig, die Risikofaktoren zu kennen, die das Vorkommen von MRSA in Tierbestanden beeinflussen. 
 Bisherige Publikationen zeigen als Risikofaktoren fur das Vorkommen von MRSA in Schwei-nebestanden Betriebsgrose, Alter der Schweine, Haltungsart und Zukauf von MRSA-positiven Ferkeln (Lassok und Tenhagen 2013). Einzelne Studien konnten zwar fur bestimm-te Risikofaktoren Tendenzen zeigen, aber aufgrund kleiner Herdenzahlen keine signifikanten Ergebnisse. In einer Metaanalyse sollten daher die verfugbaren Daten bisheriger Studien noch einmal ubergreifend ausgewertet und analysiert werden. Fur die Metaanalyse wurden als Tierpopulation Mastschweine ausgewahlt, da fur die Schweinehaltung die meisten Stu-dien verfugbar waren und Zuchtschweine umfangreich in der Studie der EFSA untersucht worden waren (EFSA 2010). Daruber dienen Mastschweine unmittelbar der Lebensmittelge-winnung und sind damit naher am Verbraucher, so dass das Vorkommen von MRSA in die-sen Bestanden auch unter diesem Aspekt relevant ist. 
Zur Durchfuhrung der Analyse fand eine umfangreiche Publikationsrecherche in den Datenbanken Pubmed, Web of Science und Scopus statt. Die Suchkriterien â€žpig/sow/swineâ€œ wur-den kombiniert mit â€žmethicillinâ€œ und â€žMRSAâ€œ. Berucksichtigt wurden englisch- und deutschsprachige Studien, die bis zum 20. Februar 2013 in den Datenbanken gelistet waren. 600 wissenschaftliche Publikationen wurden gefunden. Davon erfullten 21 Studien aus Deutsch-land, den Niederlanden, Belgien, Italien, Danemark, den USA und Kanada zunachst die Ein-schlusskriterien: In den Arbeiten wurden neben der MRSA-Pravalenz in Tierbestanden auch mogliche Risikofaktoren erfasst, wie etwa Betriebsgrose, Alter der Schweine und Behand-lung mit Antibiotika. Dazu kamen vier Dissertationsarbeiten aus Deutschland, die ebenfalls die Einschlusskriterien erfullten. 
Um die Beziehung zwischen den Faktoren ubergreifend analysieren und aus dem Pool vor-handener Daten sinnvolle Auswertungskategorien bilden zu konnen, musste mit Einzelda-tensatzen gearbeitet werden. Die Studien waren sehr heterogen im Aufbau und in der Erfassung der Parameter, da die Fragestellungen, die uber die Pravalenz-Erfassung hinausgin-gen, differierten. So wurde die MRSA-Pravalenz uber verschiedene Probenahmeverfahren ermittelt (Nasentupfer von unterschiedlichen Tierzahlen, Staubproben, Sockentupfer, Gulle-proben). Auch die Anzahl der genommenen Proben unterschied sich zwischen den Studien, und die in den Betrieben erhobenen moglichen Risikofaktoren variierten. 
Die in den Studien erhobenen Faktoren wurden in einer Datentabelle zusammengetragen, sowohl solche, die das Vorkommen von MRSA beeinflussten als auch solche, die offenbar keinen Einfluss zu haben schienen. Um die Einzeldatensatze zu erhalten, wurde Kontakt zu den Autorinnen und Autoren aufgenommen. Ihnen wurde eine Datentabelle mit Ausfullhin-weisen per Email geschickt mit der Bitte, diese entweder auszufullen oder die entsprechen-den Informationen zur Verfugung zu stellen. Es folgte eine umfangreiche Kommunikation mit den Autorinnen und Autoren, um Fehlinterpretationen bei der Verwendung der Daten zu vermeiden. Im Ergebnis fielen einige Studien aus der Auswertung heraus, da z. T. Rohdaten nicht mehr zur Verfugung standen, nicht mehr auf bestimmte Herden zu beziehen waren, doch nicht ausreichend weitere Faktoren erhoben wurden, oder es gab trotz mehrmaliger Anfrage keine weiteren Angaben zu den Daten. Im Zuge dieser Kommunikation konnten auch noch weitere, bisher unveroffentlichte Projektdaten, fur die Analyse nutzbar gemacht werden.",2013,

To describe the etiology of genitourinary infections, to establish the sensitivity of Neisseria gonorrhoeae to antibiotics, and to provide epidemiologic and biologic evidence to optimize the treatment of genitourinary infections.


STUDY DESIGN
Clinical and biologic diagnoses were performed on 223 women with genitourinary infections.


RESULTS
Etiologies found were trichomoniasis (27.8%), chlamydia (26.9%), bacterial vaginosis (19.7%), candidiasis (16.6), and N. gonorrhoeae infection (10.9%). Human immune deficiency virus antibodies were present in 42% of the patients. Spectinomycin or ceftriaxone should be recommended for the treatment of gonorrhoeae in Bobo-Dioulasso.


CONCLUSIONS
The prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis is higher than that of N. gonorrhoeae in Bobo-Dioulasso. This should be taken into account in clinical management of sexually transmitted diseases in this setting.",1996,Sexually transmitted diseases
Estimation of delta-contaminated density of the random intensity of Poisson data,"In the present paper, we constructed an estimator of a delta contaminated mixing density function $g(\lambda)$ of the intensity $\lambda$ of the Poisson distribution. The estimator is based on an expansion of the continuous portion $g_0(\lambda)$ of the unknown pdf over an overcomplete dictionary with the recovery of the coefficients obtained as solution of an optimization problem with Lasso penalty. In order to apply Lasso technique in the, so called, prediction setting where it requires virtually no assumptions on dictionary and, moreover, to ensure fast convergence of Lasso estimator, we use a novel formulation of the optimization problem based on inversion of the dictionary elements. The total estimator of the delta contaminated mixing pdf is obtained using a two-stage iterative procedure. We formulate conditions on the dictionary and the unknown mixing density that yield a sharp oracle inequality for the norm of the difference between $g_0 (\lambda)$ and its estimator and, thus, obtain a smaller error than in a minimax setting. Numerical simulations and comparisons with the Laguerre functions based estimator recently constructed by Comte and Genon-Catalot (2015) also show advantages of our procedure. At last, we apply the technique developed in the paper to estimation of a delta contaminated mixing density of the Poisson intensity of the Saturn's rings data.",2015,arXiv: Methodology
Bayesian Lasso and multinomial logistic regression on GPU,"We describe an efficient Bayesian parallel GPU implementation of two classic statistical models-the Lasso and multinomial logistic regression. We focus on parallelizing the key components: matrix multiplication, matrix inversion, and sampling from the full conditionals. Our GPU implementations of Bayesian Lasso and multinomial logistic regression achieve 100-fold speedups on mid-level and high-end GPUs. Substantial speedups of 25 fold can also be achieved on older and lower end GPUs. Samplers are implemented in OpenCL and can be used on any type of GPU and other types of computational units, thereby being convenient and advantageous in practice compared to related work.",2017,PLoS ONE
Hirmeriella muensteri: New data on the fertile organs leading to a revised concept of the Cheiroleopiaeae,"Abstract Based on rich material from localities in W. Germany of Early Liassic age, coniferous remains assignable to Hirmeriella muensteri (family Cheirolepidiaceae) have been thoroughly studied with the aid of cuticle analysis. Detailed information of the ovuliferous dwarf-shoots, with emphasis on the nature of the inner cuticles combined with reinterpretation of the number of pollen sacs in the pollen cones, necessitates an emendation of the species diagnosis. Emendations at the generic and family level are also proposed. Based on the new data presented here, the ovule-covering structures in the Cheiropidiacae are interpreted as epimatia; these can be characterized by free margins ( Hirmeriella ) or margins fused with the dwarf-shoot ( Frenelopsis ). The lack of a pollen chamber combined with a new interpretation of the peculiar organization of Classopollis , indicates a rather modern pollination system.",1991,Review of Palaeobotany and Palynology
"Growth, flowering, and population dynamics of temperate Western Australian seagrasses","Quantification of module size, teat, rhizome and clonal growth flowering intensity and shoot population dynamics of 7 temperate Western Australian seagrasses (Amphibolis antarctica, A. griffithii, Posidonia australis, P. sinuosa, P. angustifolia, Heterozostera tasmanica, Thalassodendron pachyrhizum) developing 8 monospecific stands reveals that these plants have different plant morphologies, display a wide repertoire of growth patterns, and exhibit substantial variability in their capacity to flower. Leaf production rate ranged between 2.6 (P. sinuosa) and 26 leaves yr -1 (A. antarctica), and leaf life-span varied between 85 (A. antarctica) and 245 d (P. sinuosa). Most of the species extended their horizontal rhizomes at rates slower than 10 cm yr 1 . The highest rate of new short shoot formation by vertical rhizomes was observed in A. antarctica (on average each vertical rhizome annually produced 1.5 new short shoots), and the lowest in T pachyrhizum (only 1 new short shoot would be recruited from 65 vertical rhizomes). Horizontal rhizomes produced I new short shoot every 17 (H. tasmanica) or 582 d (P. sinuosa). Flowering intensity varied from 0 (P. sinuosa) to 7% flowering short shoots yr -1 (P. australis). The median age of the short shoots in these populations ranged from 367 (H. tasmanica) to 1000 d (P. sinuosa). Clonal growth was the main mechanism providing short shoots in these temperate Western Australian meadows. Short shoot recruitment balanced short shoot mortality rate in most populations, indicating that they were in steady-state with the colonisation process. These species maintain their meadows through different plant strategies as a result of their different growth programmes and the variability in sexual reproduction success. The large differences in flowering intensity found across temperate Western Australian seagrasses suggest that sexual reproduction may play an important role for meadow maintenance anti recovery.",1999,Marine Ecology Progress Series
Una metodologia speditiva per la valutazione di vulnerabilitÃ  sismica di edifici in muratura e calcestruzzo armato,"La presente memoria propone una metodologia speditiva per la valutazione della vulnerabilita sismica di edifici in calcestruzzo armato e muratura; lâ€™obiettivo principale e quello di fornire uno strumento in grado di valutare comparativamente lo stato di criticita di edifici appartenenti a grandi patrimoni immobiliari, sia pubblici che privati, e consentire quindi la definizione di priorita di intervento. Lâ€™affinamento del metodo e la calibrazione nei riguardi di numerosi casi studio consentono di raggiungere stime di vulnerabilita sufficientemente affidabili. La procedura trae spunto da metodi sviluppati in letteratura per la valutazione della vulnerabilita su larga scala, conducendo alla definizione di unâ€™accelerazione al suolo di collasso dellâ€™edificio (PGAC) attraverso la valutazione del taglio resistente dello stesso. Questâ€™ultimo viene valutato facendo uso di considerazioni meccaniche semplificate e prevede lâ€™utilizzo del giudizio esperto per tenere in conto la reale complessita della costruzione in esame. I valori quantitativi vengono poi confrontati con intervalli di vulnerabilita proposti in una classificazione semplificata denominata RE.SIS.TOÂ®, che e utilizzabile per definire il livello di criticita del fabbricato. Nella nota sono infine descritti i risultati dellâ€™applicazione del metodo ad un numero consistente di edifici di proprieta della Provincia di Bologna mettendoli a confronto, per alcuni di essi, con quelli ottenuti mediante analisi di vulnerabilita piu accurate.",2013,
Identifying individual sleep apnea/hypoapnea epochs using smartphone-based pulse oximetry,"Sleep apnea, characterized by frequent pauses in breathing during sleep, poses a serious threat to the healthy growth and development of children. Polysomnography (PSG), the gold standard for sleep apnea diagnosis, is resource intensive and confined to sleep laboratories, thus reducing its accessibility. Pulse oximetry alone, providing blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) and blood volume changes in tissue (PPG), has the potential to identify children with sleep apnea. Thus, we aim to develop a tool for at-home sleep apnea screening that provides a detailed and automated 30 sec epoch-by-epoch sleep apnea analysis. We propose to extract features characterizing pulse oximetry (SpO2 and pulse rate variability [PRV], a surrogate measure of heart rate variability) to create a multivariate logistic regression model that identifies epochs containing apnea/hypoapnea events. Overnight pulse oximetry was collected using a smartphone-based pulse oximeter, simultaneously with standard PSG from 160 children at the British Columbia Children's hospital. The sleep technician manually scored all apnea/hypoapnea events during the PSG study. Based on these scores we labeled each epoch as containing or not containing apnea/hypoapnea. We randomly divided the subjects into training data (40%), used to develop the model applying the LASSO method, and testing data (60%), used to validate the model. The developed model was assessed epoch-by-epoch for each subject. The test dataset had a median area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 81%; the model provided a median accuracy of 74% sensitivity of 75%, and specificity of 73% when using a risk threshold similar to the percentage of apnea/hypopnea epochs. Thus, providing a detailed epoch-by-epoch analysis with at-home pulse oximetry alone is feasible with accuracy, sensitivity and specificity values above 73% However, the performance might decrease when analyzing subjects with a low number of apnea/hypoapnea events.",2016,Conference proceedings : ...

Nutrient Balances and Economic Performance in Urban and Peri-urban Vegetable Production Systems of Three West African Cities,"Urban and peri-urban (UPA) cultivation supplies fresh vegetables and employment for the increasing number of urban inhabitants. It is characterized by the use of large nutrient inputs to increase productivity and often associated with negative environmental risks. For these reasons, this study quantified nutrient (nitrogen, N; phosphorus, P; and potassium, K) flows and economic performance of UPA gardening of the three West African cities of Kano, Nigeria; Bobo Dioulasso, Burkina Faso; Sikasso, Mali, during a 2-year period using the Mon itoring for Q uality I mprovement ( MonQI ) toolbox considering inflows and outflows sources. Average annual N, P and K balances were positive for all gardens in the three cities with N balances of 279, 1127 and 74 kg N ha âˆ’1 in Kano, Bobo Dioulasso and Sikasso, respectively, except for annual K deficits of 222 and 187 kg K ha âˆ’1 in Kano and Sikasso, respectively. Nitrogen use efficiencies were 63%, 51% and 87% in Kano, Bobo Dioulasso and Sikasso, respectively, with poor P use efficiencies due to excess application in all three cities. However, a high K efficiency was observed in Bobo Dioulasso (87%) while applications of K were lower than required in Kano and Sikasso with efficiencies of 121% and 110%, indicating possible K mining. The average annual gross margins from gardening indicated a statistically higher ( p âˆ’2 in Bobo Dioulasso than returns obtained in Kano (US$0.92 m âˆ’2 ) and Sikasso (US$1.37 m âˆ’2 ). Although an economically vibrant activity, intensive UPA vegetable production needs to be reviewed for strategic planning towards improving N and P use efficiencies in order to maintain its productivity as well as safeguard the environment. Appropriate K fertilization is necessary to avoid long term K depletion in Kano and Sikasso UPA gardening.",2015,Experimental Agriculture
Interregional causal influences of brain metabolic activity reveal the spread of aging effects during normal aging,"During healthy brain aging, different brain regions show anatomical or functional declines at different rates, and some regions may show compensatory increases in functional activity. However, few studies have explored interregional influences of brain activity during the aging process. We proposed a causality analysis framework combining high dimensionality independent component analysis (ICA), Granger causality, and LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) regression on longitudinal brain metabolic activity data measured by Fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). We analyzed FDG-PET images from healthy old subjects, who were scanned for at least five sessions with an averaged intersession interval of about one year. The longitudinal data were concatenated across subjects to form a time series, and the first order autoregressive model was used to measure interregional causality among the independent sources of metabolic activity identified using ICA. Several independent sources with reduced metabolic activity in aging, including the anterior temporal lobe and orbital frontal cortex, demonstrated causal influences over many widespread brain regions. On the other hand, the influenced regions were more distributed, and had smaller age related declines or even relatively increased metabolic activity. The current data demonstrated interregional spreads of aging on metabolic activity at the scale of a year, and have identified key brain regions in the aging process that have strong influences over other regions.",2019,bioRxiv
Adaptive Parallel Primal-Dual Method for Saddle Point Problems,"The primal-dual hybrid gradient method is a classic way to tackle saddlepoint problems. However, its convergence is not guaranteed in general. Some restrictions on the step size parameters, e.g., Ï„Ïƒ â‰¤ 1/â€–A Aâ€–, are imposed to guarantee the convergence. In this paper, a new convergent method with no restriction on parameters is proposed. Hence the expensive calculation of â€–A Aâ€– is avoided. This method produces a predictor like other primal-dual methods but in a parallel fashion, which has the potential to speed up the method. This new iterate is then updated by a simple correction to guarantee the convergence. Moreover, the parameters are adjusted dynamically to enhance the efficiency as well as the robustness of the method. The generated sequence monotonically converges to the solution set. A worst-case O (1/t) convergence rate in ergodic sense is also established under mild assumptions. The numerical efficiency of the proposed method is verified by applications in LASSO problem and Steiner tree problem.

"Chaetotaxy and ultrastructure of sensory receptors in the cercaria of a species of Allassogonoporus Olivier, 1938 (Digenea:Lecithodendriidae)","A standard procedure that combines chaetotaxic, ultrastructural and neuromorphological observations has recently provided a new perspective to the study of cercarial sensory systems. In the present work, we aimed to extend the use of this combination of techniques to investigate the chaetotaxy of Allassogonoporus sp. in conjunction with the ultrastructure of sensory receptors and neuromorphology. Five nerve regions were distinguished. A conspicuous bilobed cerebral ganglion was observed at the level of the pharynx. The chaetotaxic pattern was generally consistent with that of other lecithodendriids. Four types of receptors were distinguished with scanning electron microscopy. These types differed in cilium length (short, moderately long or long) and tegumentary collar length (moderately low or high). Internal ultrastructure of receptor type IIAL revealed an unsheathed cilium, a closed basal body, septate extracellular junctional complexes and thickened nerve collars. Some receptor types were site-specific. Long uniciliated receptors were found mainly on the dorsal surface, whereas short uniciliated receptors were widespread across the tegument. Ultrastructure and site-specificity observations suggest that most sensory receptors are mechanoreceptors, probably reflecting the important role mechanoreception plays in host finding.",2004,Systematic Parasitology
Sensors potenciomÃ¨trics selectius a tensioactius aniÃ²nics,"Han estat preparats diversos sensors potenciometrics basats en parells ionics insolubles (1:1) provinents de lassociacio dions tensioactius, en particular el catio tetradodecilamoni i lanio dodecilbenzesulfonat (DBS-). Els materials sensors, incorporats a una matriu polimerica de clorur de polivinil (PVC) que contenia com a agent plastificant lo-nitrofeniloctil eter, van ser aplicats sobre una resina conductora per tal de fornir electrodes sense solucio interna de referencia. La resposta daquests electrodes a dodecilsulfat (DS-) i DBS- aixi com la interferencia de diversos anions inorganics habituals i cations tensioactius va ser igualment examinada. Es presenten els principals parametres corresponents a lavaluacio daquests electrodes i els seus temps de resposta. Les membranes estudiades mostren un bon comportament en ser utilitzades com a sensors potenciometrics per a tensioactius anionics.
Aquests electrodes van ser emprats en la determinacio de mostres comercials danions tensioactius per mitja de valoracions potenciometriques amb el reactiu valorant Hyamine 1622 (Hy+), sense apareixer discrepancies en els resultats quan aquests es comparaven amb el metode de la valoracio amb indicador mixt de les dues fases. Les caracteristiques globals de funcionament milloren les corresponents a lelectrode comercial de tensioactius Orion, permetent la valoracio de tensioactius a concentracions inferiors a 10mM i la seva aplicabilitat en analisis de rutina.
Ha estat desenvolupat un sistema dinjeccio en flux amb deteccio potenciometrica per a la monitoritzacio del contingut de tensioactiu anionic en solucions de rentat de planxes metalÂ·liques, emprant electrodes tubulars all-solid-state revestits de membrana de PVC. La mostra, amb una forca ionica elevada i un pH extremadament basic, es determinada despres de ser condicionada a partir dun sistema de flux bicanal. Amb aquest procediment sobtenen uns errors mitjans al voltant de l1 % i una velocitat danalisi dunes 30 mostres/hora.
Fent us de la mateixa membrana polimerica, es van desenvolupar transistors defecte de camp selectius a ions (ISFETs) per a tensioactius anionics. En aquest cas, els dispositius van mostrar uns temps de vida superiors a 4 mesos, millorant els resultats habituals per a ISFETs basats en membranes de PVC. Altres caracteristiques a ressaltar son els pendents nernstians aconseguits (59 a 62 mV/dec), limits de deteccio propers a 10-6 M, una bona linealitat i una adequada resposta tant a diversos anions tensioactius com al reactiu emprat en la determinacio potenciometrica, el que va permetre lavaluacio del contingut global dels tensioactius anionics presents en diferents mostres. No van apareixer diferencies significatives durant la comparacio dels resultats obtinguts emprant el metode proposat que utilitza els ISFETs com a indicadors de punt final i el metode de valoracio en dues fases.
Van ser estudiades noves formulacions fotocurables en un intent de superar les limitacions inherents a les membranes de PVC i compatibilitzar la preparacio de les membranes amb les tecniques fotolitografiques que poden produir sensors miniaturitzats. Aquestes membranes estan basades en un polimer dureta-acrilat que empra 2-cianofeniloctil eter com a plastificant compatible amb el proces de fotopolimeritzacio. Aquestes membranes han resultat altament selectives als anions tensioactius assajats al mateix temps que els anions inorganics mes habituals no interfereixen de forma important. Es proposa una metodologia per tal doptimitzar la composicio de la membrana que condueix a una formulacio apta per a un us general. Aquesta membrana es completament caracteritzada, incloent els calibratges a anions tensioactius com el DBS-, el tetrapropilenbenzesulfonat i el DS-, aixi com als cations Hy+ i cetiltrimetilamoni. Les dades corresponents a lio principal mostren una sensibilitat de 58.1 mV/dec, una resposta lineal situada entre 1 x 10-3 M i 3 x 10-6 M, un limit de deteccio corresponent a 0.26 ppm DBS- i una reproductibilitat del pendent entre dies, expressada com a desviacio estandard relativa, del 2.8 %.
Finalment, es descriu la preparacio de nous ISFETs basats en la membrana fotocurable previament optimitzada. Aquests dispositius no presenten diferencies significatives (P=0.05) en termes de sensibilitat i reproductibilitat en ser comparats amb els corresponents electrodes selectius i presenten, addicionalment, una millora en els temps de resposta. Es mostra laplicacio daquests ISFETs en la monitoritzacio dels processos de fotodegradacio, emprant dispersions de dioxid de titani, per a dos anions tensioactius: el DBS-, que conte una part aromatica en la seva estructura i el DS-, de cadena alquilica. La determinacio del contingut de tensioactiu va ser portada a terme emprant una metodologia daddicio estandard fent us dels ISFETs com a sensors potenciometrics, sense la necessitat detapes de separacio previes. La cinetica de degradacio, en ambdos casos, va resultar de primer ordre, amb uns temps de vida mitjana de 31.5 min per a DBS- i 52.0 min per a DS-.
---------------------------------------------------Potentiometric sensors, based on ion-pair 1:1 water-insoluble salts, were prepared using tetradodecylammonim as cationic and dodecylbenzenesulfonate (DBS-) as anionic surfactant. Sensing materials were incorporated in poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) matrix containing o-nitrophenyl octyl ether as a plasticizer and applied on a support of conductive resin without inner reference solution. The response of these electrodes to dodecylsulfate (DS-) and DBS- as well as the interferences of several common inorganic anions and cationic surfactants were examined. The main parameters of evaluation of these electrodes and response times are presented and its behaviour is discussed. The membranes show good performance for use as a general potentiometric sensor responsive to anionic surfactants.
These electrodes were applied to the determination of anionic surfactants by potentiometric titration using Hyamine 1622 (Hy+) as the titrant. The results from this method compare favourably with those of the two-phase mixed indicator titrationt method for several commercial anionic surfactants. The performance characteristics improve the commercially available Orion surfactant electrode allowing the titration of surfactants at concentrations down to 10mM and its applicability in routine analysis.
A flow-injection system based on potentiometric detection and designed for the monitoring of anionic surfactant content of printing plates washing solutions was developed. PVC membrane ion-selective electrodes, constructed with all-solid-state tubular flow-through design were used. The sample, with high ionic strength and extremely alkaline pH, was conditioned in a two-channel flow injection system, allowing for surfactant determination. Errors of approximately 1 % may be obtained and the sample throughput achieved is around 30 samples per hour.
Using the same PVC membrane, ion-selective field-effect transistors (ISFETs) to anionic surfactants were developed. These devices showed a lifetime longer than four months, improving values of PVC membrane-ISFETs. Othes characteristics are Nernstian slopes from 59 to 62 mV/dec, detection limits of about 10-6 M and good linearity. The also showed response to several anionic surfactant species and to the reagent used for the potentiometric titration. This allowed the measurement of the overall anonic surfactant content in different samples. In a comparative study, there were no significant diferences between the results produced with the standard, two-phase titration method and the proposed potentiometric titration method using surfactant ISFETs as end-point indicators.
Overcoming the PVC membrane limitations, new photocurable formulations were studied, were the membrane manufacture could be compatible with massive photolithographic techniques to produce miniaturized sensors. These membranes are based on a urethane-acrylate polymer, and use 2-cyanophenyl octyl ether (CPOE), a plasticizer compatible with the photocuring process. These membranes are highly selective to the anionic surfactants assayed while common inorganic anions did not interfere. An optimization methodology is proposed for their formulation, suited to the final application. A membrane with a general-purpose formulation is fully characterized, including calibration results for anionic surfactants such as DBS-, tetrapropylenebenzenesulfonate and DS-, or cationic surfactants such as Hy+ and cetyltrimethylammonium ion. With the primary ion DBS- we verified a 58.1 mV/dec sensitivity, a linear response between 1 x 10-3 M and 3 x 10-6 M, a detection limit corresponding to 0.26 ppm DBS- and a slope precision of 2.8 % RSD betweeen days.
Finally, the preparation of a new ISFET based on the optimized previous membrane is described. When compared to convencional ion-selective electrodes, the prepared ISFETs do not show significant diferences in sensitivity and reproducibility (P=0.05), improving the response time. As the application, photodegradation process using titanium dioxide dispersions, were monitorized for two anionic surfactants: DBS-, being aromatic, and the more alkylic DS-. The determination of surfactant concentration was performed following a standard addition methodology, using ISFETs as the sensors, and without any previous separation stages. The degradation kinetics in both cases are first-order processes, with half-life times of 31.5 min for DBS- and 52.0 min for DS-.",2002,

Contraction properties of shrinkage priors in logistic regression,"Abstract Bayesian shrinkage priors have received a lot of attention recently because of their efficiency in computation and accuracy in estimation and variable selection. In this paper, we study the contraction properties of shrinkage priors in a logistic regression model where the number of covariates is high. For a shrinkage prior distribution that is heavy-tailed and concentrated around zero with high probability such as the horseshoe prior, the Dirichletâ€“Laplace prior, and the normal-gamma prior with appropriate choices of hyper-parameters, estimates of the logistic regression coefficient are shown to asymptotically concentrate around the true sparse vector in the L 2 -sense. It is shown that the proposed contraction rate is comparable with the point mass prior that is studied in Atchade (2017). The simulation study under the logistic regression model verifies the theoretical results by showing that the horseshoe prior and the Dirichletâ€“Laplace prior perform like the point mass prior for the estimation, variable selection and prediction, and yield much better results than Bayesian lasso and the non-informative normal prior.",2020,Journal of Statistical Planning and Inference
Fate and Biological Activity of the Antimicrobial Lasso Peptide Microcin J25 Under Gastrointestinal Tract Conditions,"The bacteriocin microcin J25 (MccJ25) inhibits the growth of Gram-negative pathogens including Salmonella and Shigella species, and Escherichia coli.

In this study, we used the dynamic simulator TIM-1 as gastro-intestinal tract model to evaluate the stability and antibacterial activity of MccJ25 during passage through the proximal portion of the human gastrointestinal tract. MccJ25 concentration was measured in the different simulator sections by HPLC, and inhibition of Salmonella enterica serotype Enteritidis was evaluated using qualitative and quantitative assays. LC-MS/MS analysis and subsequent molecular networking analysis on the Global Natural Product Social Molecular Networking platform (GNPS) and analysis of the peptide degradation in the presence of proteolytic enzymes mimicking the gastro-intestinal conditions permitted to delineate the fate of MccJ25 through identification of the main degradation products. MccJ25 was relatively stable under gastric conditions, but degraded rapidly in the compartment mimicking the duodenum, notably in the presence of pancreatin. Among pancreatin components, elastase I appeared primarily responsible for MccJ25 breakdown, while Î±-chymotrypsin was less efficient.",2018,Frontiers in Microbiology
Purification and Characterization of a Novel Î±-Agarase from a Thalassomonas sp.,"An agar-degrading Thalassomonas bacterium, strain JAMB-A33, was isolated from the sediment off Noma Point, Japan, at a depth of 230 m. A novel Î±-agarase from the isolate was purified to homogeneity from cultures containing agar as a carbon source. The molecular mass of the purified enzyme, designated as agaraseA33, was 85 kDa on both SDS-PAGE and gel-filtration chromatography, suggesting that it is a monomer. The optimal pH and temperature for activity were about 8.5 and 45Â°C, respectively. The enzyme had a specific activity of 40.7 U/mg protein. The pattern of agarose hydrolysis showed that the enzyme is an endo-type Î±-agarase, and the final main product was agarotetraose. The enzyme degraded not only agarose but also agarohexaose, neoagarohexaose, and porphyran.",2004,Current Microbiology
StabilitÃ© de la sÃ©lection de variables pour la classification de donnÃ©es en grande dimension,"Les donnees a haut-debit ont motive le developpement de methodes statistiques pour la selection de variables. Ces donnees sont caracterisees par leur grande dimension et par leur heterogeneite car le signal est souvent observe simultanement a plusieurs facteurs de confusion. Les approches habituelles sont ainsi remises en question car elles peuvent conduire a des decisions erronees. Efron (2007), Leek and Storey (2007, 2008), Friguet et al (2009) montrent l'impact negatif de l'heterogeneite des donnees sur le nombre de faux-positifs des tests multiples. La selection de variables est une etape importante de la construction d'un modele de classification en grande dimension car elle reduit la dimension du probleme aux variables les plus predictives. On s'interesse ici aux performances de classification de la selection de variables, via la procedure LASSO (Tibshirani (1996)) et a la reproductibilite des ensembles de variables selectionnes. Des simulations montrent que l'ensemble des variables selectionnees par le LASSO n'est pas celui des meilleurs predicteurs theoriques. Aussi, d'interessantes performances de classification ne sont atteintes que pour un grand nombre de variables selectionnees. Notre methode s'appuie sur la description de la dependance entre covariables grÃ¢ce a un petit nombre de variables latentes (Friguet et al. (2009)). La strategie proposee consiste a appliquer les procedures sur les donnees conditionnellement a cette structure de dependance. Cette strategie permet de stabiliser les variables selectionnees : d'interessantes performances de classification sont atteintes pour de plus petits ensembles de variables et les variables les plus predictives sont detectees.",2013,

"Autoimmune Diseases in Limited Setting Country (Burkina Faso): Epidemiology, Technical and Diagnostic Performance of Specific Biomarkers for the Early Diagnosis","Background: Autoimmune diseases have been rarely reported in limited setting country. We aimed to investigate the burden, immunological and clinical diagnosis of autoimmune diseases in Burkina Faso. Methods: We prospectively enrolled patients with a suspected autoimmune disease at University Hospital SOURO SANOU, in Bobo Dioulasso, BURKINA FASO, between 2012 and 2014 for this cohort study. Demographic characteristics, clinical manifestations, sera autoantibodies determination and plasma viral and bacteria statuse (HBV, HCV, HIV, and Dengue serotype 1, 2, 3 and 4, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Lyme disease) were determined. All plasma samples were stored at â€“ 80Â°C when analyzed was not making immediately. Results: During the three year study period, totally 65 patients with suspicion of autoimmune diseases were diagnosed. The referral diagnosis was right in 17/65 patients (26.2%) among patients in the limited setting country (Burkina Faso). The incidence of autoimmune diseases was 17/73950 (0.023%). There were 4/73950 (0.005%) patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 5/73950(0.007%) with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 2/73950 (0.003 %%) with CREST and Polymyositis, 2/73950 (0.003%) with CREST, 1/73950 (0.001%) with Gougerot SjÃ¶grenâ€™s syndrome (SSG), 2/73950 (0.003%) with Thyroiditis of Hashimoto and, 1/73950 (0.001%) with sarcoidosis. The median age at the diagnosis of autoimmune diseases were respectively 51 years (28 -75 years) and male to female ratio of 0.06 (1/16). The plasma viral status (HBV, HCV, CMV and HIV, Lyme disease, Dengue serotype 1, 2, 3 and 4) was negative. Mycobacterium tuberculosisâ€™s cases were 3.07%). The immune suppressorâ€™s treatment again autoimmune diseases were not efficient among 2/17 of patients. Conclusion: The referral diagnosis was right in 17/65 (26.2%). The incidence was 17/73950 (0.023%) in the limited setting country (Burkina Faso). There was not a significant associated relation between autoimmune diseases and infection; there was not also significant association between autoimmune diseases and hygienic hypothesis.",2016,
Parallel Asynchronous Stochastic Coordinate Descent with Auxiliary Variables,"The key to the recent success of coordinate descent (CD) in many applications is to maintain a set of auxiliary variables to facilitate efficient single variable updates. For example, the vector of residual/primal variables has to be maintained when CD is applied for Lasso/linear SVM, respectively. An implementation without maintenance is O(n) times slower than the one with maintenance, where n is the number of variables. In serial implementations, maintaining auxiliary variables is only a computing trick without changing the behavior of coordinate descent. However, maintenance of auxiliary variables is non-trivial when there are multiple threads/workers which read/write the auxiliary variables concurrently. Thus, most existing theoretical analysis of parallel CD either assumes vanilla CD without auxiliary variables (which ends up being extremely slow in practice) or limits to a small class of problems. In this paper, we consider a rich family of objective functions where AUX-PCD can be applied. We also establish global linear convergence for AUX-PCD with atomic operations for a general family of functions and perform a complete backward error analysis of AUX-PCD with wild updates, where some updates are not just delayed but lost because of memory conflicts. Our results enable us to provide theoretical guarantees for many practical parallel coordinate descent implementations, which currently lack guarantees (such as the implementation of Shotgun by Bradley et al. 2011, which uses auxiliary variables)",2019,
Parerga to the Stadiasmus Patarensis (8): On the named places in the journeys of sacrifice recorded in the Vita of Saint Nicholas of Holy Sion,"This paper aims to determine the route taken by Nicholas of Holy Sion in his journeys of sacrifice which are recorded in his Vita and in so doing, presents some suggestions as to the locations of Tragalassos and its territory and of the ten places with churches that were visited by him on the second long journey which lasted 25 days. The settlement of Arapyurdu is suggested as the location of Tragalassos. The hamlet of Pharroa, belonging to Tragalassos, is identified with a new settlement located 1 km to the northeast of Alacahisar church. The following are the places recorded in the course of this 25-day journey: Karkabo, Kausai, Nea Kome, Partaessos, Symbolon, Nautes, Serine, Trebendai, Kastellon and Hemalissoi. This journey began from the monastery of Holy Sion (probably to be identified as the Alacahisar church) and the first visit was to the shrine of Gabriel at Karkabo which is identified with the basilica at Alakilise through an inscription found in the Alakilise valley 7 km to the northeast of Myra (an identification already proposed by C. Foss). After Karkabo/Alakilise, Nicholas would have taken a route in a southerly direction to visit the extant sanctuaries around the Alakilise valley. The second destination, Kausai, might be Dikmen Tepesi, the closest settlement having an early Byzantine church 1 km south of the basilica at Alakilise. The next place Nea Kome can be localized at Karacaorenâ€“Gunagi (the newly discovered settlement and an early Byzantine church are introduced in this paper) lying ca. 2 km southeast of Alakilise. The fourth station Partaessos was probably at Yilanbasi ca. 3 km southeast of Alakilise and ca. 1 km southeast of the Gunagi church. Nicholas went down from Partaessos to the fifth stop Symbolon, probably being the ancient name of the â€œDalyanâ€ lagoon, lying 4 km east of Myra. The next place visited, Nautes meaning â€œsailorâ€, must be near to the lagoon (Symbolon). After Symbolon and Nautes, Nicholas continued his route in a northerly direction to visit the remaining four places and to return to his monastery. Serine can be localized as Turant Asari located 5 km to the northeast of Myra and 2 km east of Muskar/Beloren. The next place Trebendai, which was an independent city during the Hellenistic period, should be localized as Muskar due to a previously unpublished inscription, published here, the contents of which have been employed in order to identify Trebendai as Muskar. The ninth stop, Kastellon, should be located between the monastery of H. Sion and Myra according to the Vita, and the last station Hemalissoi should be between Kastellon and the monastery of Sion. If the distribution of the churches in the area and Nicholasâ€™s route are taken into consideration, Kastellon should be located in or around Devekuyusu, and Hemalissoi can be identified with the village of Karabel.",2011,

Alternative prior distributions for variable selection with very many more variables than observations,"The problem of variable selection in regression and the generalised linear model is addressed. 
We adopt a Bayesian approach with priors for the regression coefficients that are 
scale mixtures of normal distributions and embody a high prior probability of proximity to 
zero. By seeking modal estimates we generalise the lasso. Properties of the priors and their 
resultant posteriors are explored in the context of the linear and generalised linear model especially 
when there are more variables than observations. We develop EM algorithms that 
embrace the need to explore the multiple modes of the non log-concave posterior distributions. 
Finally we apply the technique to microarray data using a probit model to find the 
genetic predictors of osteo- versus rheumatoid arthritis.

The Reflection Theorem,"The goal is show that the reflection theorem holds. The theorem is as usual in the Morse-Kelley theory of classes (MK). That theory works with universal class which consists of all sets and every class is a subclass of it. In this paper (and in another Mizar articles) we work in Tarski-Grothendieck (TG) theory (see [15]) which ensures the existence of sets that have properties like universal class (i.e. this theory is stronger than MK). The sets are introduced in [13] and some concepts of MK are modeled. The concepts are: the classOnof all ordinal numbers belonging to the universe, subclasses, transfinite sequences of non-empty elements of universe, etc. The reflection theorem states that if AÎ¾ is an increasing and continuous transfinite sequence of non-empty sets and class A= â‹ƒ Î¾âˆˆOnAÎ¾, then for every formula H there is a strictly increasing continuous mapping F : Onâ†’ On such that ifÎº is a critical number ofF (i.e. F(Îº) = Îº > 0) and f âˆˆ AVAR Îº , thenA, f |= H â‰¡ AÎº , f |= H. The proof is based on [11]. Besides, in the article it is shown that every universal class is a model of ZF set theory if Ï‰ (the first infinite ordinal number) belongs to it. Some propositions concerning ordinal numbers and sequences of them are also present.",1990,
Theory for the Lasso,"We study the Lasso, i.e., l1-penalized empirical risk minimization, for general convex loss functions. The aim is to show that the Lasso penalty enjoys good theoretical properties, in the sense that its prediction error is of the same order of magnitude as the prediction error one would have if one knew a priori which variables are relevant. The chapter starts out with squared error loss with fixed design, because there the derivations are the simplest. For more general loss, we defer the probabilistic arguments to Chapter 14. We allow for misspecification of the (generalized) linear model, and will consider an oracle that represents the best approximation within the model of the truth. An important quantity in the results will be the so-called compatibility constant, which we require to be non-zero. The latter requirement is called the compatibility condition, a condition with eigenvalue-flavor to it. Our bounds (for prediction error, etc.) are given in explicit (non-asymptotic) form.",2011,

A Fuzzy-based Software Tool Used to Predict 110m Hurdles Results During the Annual Training Cycle,"This paper describes a fuzzy-based software tool for predicting results in the 110m hurdles. The predictive models were built on using 40 annual training cycles completed by 18 athletes. These models include: ordinary least squares regression, ridge regression, LASSO regression, elastic net regression and nonlinear fuzzy correction of least squares regression. In order to compare them, and choose the best model, leave-one-out cross-validation was used. This showed that the fuzzy corrector proposed in this paper has the lowest prediction error. The developed software can support a coach in planning an athleteâ€™s annual training cycle. It allows the athleteâ€™s results to be predicted, and in this way, for the best training loads to be selected. The tool is a web-based interactive application that can be run from a computer or a mobile device. The whole system was implemented using the R programming language with additional packages.",2016,
Factors associated with physiciansâ€™ prescriptions for rheumatoid arthritis drugs not filled by patients,"BackgroundThis study estimated the extent and predictors of primary nonadherence (i.e., prescriptions made by physicians but not initiated by patients) to methotrexate and to biologics or tofacitinib in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients who were newly prescribed these medications.MethodsUsing administrative claims linked with electronic health records (EHRs) from multiple healthcare provider organizations in the USA, RA patients who received a new prescription for methotrexate or biologics/tofacitinib were identified from EHRs. Claims data were used to ascertain filling or administration status. A logistic regression model for predicting primary nonadherence was developed and tested in training and test samples. Predictors were selected based on clinical judgment and LASSO logistic regression.ResultsA total of 36.8% of patients newly prescribed methotrexate failed to initiate methotrexate within 2Â months; 40.6% of patients newly prescribed biologics/tofacitinib failed to initiate within 3Â months. Factors associated with methotrexate primary nonadherence included age, race, region, body mass index, count of active drug ingredients, and certain previously diagnosed and treated conditions at baseline. Factors associated with biologics/tofacitinib primary nonadherence included age, insurance, and certain previously treated conditions at baseline. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the logistic regression model estimated in the training sample and applied to the independent test sample was 0.86 and 0.78 for predicting primary nonadherence to methotrexate and to biologics/tofacitinib, respectively.ConclusionsThis study confirmed that failure to initiate new prescriptions for methotrexate and biologics/tofacitinib was common in RA patients. It is feasible to predict patients at high risk of primary nonadherence to methotrexate and to biologics/tofacitinib and to target such patients for early interventions to promote adherence.",2018,Arthritis Research & Therapy

When the dimension of parameters is fixed, we derive the asymptotic distribution of the modified LASSO estimators under certain regularity condition. When the dimension of parameters increases with respect to n, the consistency on the probability of the correct selection of penalty parameters is shown under certain regularity conditions.

Latex and non-latex orthodontic elastic force loss due to cyclic temperature.,"UNLABELLED
The purpose of this study was to compare the force loss of 1/4 inch (6.35mm) 3.5oz (99g) medium latex elastics from Ormco Corp. to non-latex elastics from ClassOne Orthodontics and Phoenix after being cycled between different temperatures. Elastics were stretched to 1.57 inches (40mm) on jigs and cycled in water baths for 4 minutes at 5 degrees C and 37 degrees C, 21 degrees C and 37 degrees C, 5 degrees C and 50 degrees C, 37 degrees C and 50 degrees C, and a control group was held at 3 degrees 7 degrees C. The force produced by new elastics and elastics after incubation was measured using a Mini 44 Instron.


RESULTS
All elastics experienced increased force loss that correlated with increased temperatures with the exception of Ormco latex elastics. The latex elastics had the greatest force loss upon cycling between 5 degrees C and 50 degrees C while the non-latex elastics had the greatest force loss while cycling between 37 degrees C and 50 degrees C. All elastics were strongest when cycled between 5 degrees C and 37 degrees C.


CONCLUSION
This study suggests that hot liquids reduce the force of latex and non-latex elastics even when cycled between hot temperatures for brief periods of time.",2011,Texas dental journal
Caratterizzazione mediante misure dinamiche e di elettroluminescenza di dispositivi AlGaN/GaN HEMT con elettrodo di gate trasparente,"In questo lavoro di tesi si sono studiate, principalmente attraverso misure di elettoluminescenza e prove dinamiche, le caratteristiche di dispositivi HEMT su GaN dotati di struttura di gate innovativa (ITO e Ni/ITO) confrontandole con quelle di dispositivi con gate tradizionale in Ni/Au/Ni. La particolarita dei dispositivi misurati e appunto il tipo di materiale con cui e costruito lo stack di gate; l'ITO (Indium Tin Oxide), infatti, e noto per la sua trasparenza. Questa particolarita permette dunque di indagare, attraverso le misure di elettroluminescenza, sulla regione attiva sotto al gate: zona molto importante per capire i meccanismi di degrado di questo tipo di dispositivi. 
I dispositivi misurati appartenevano tutti allo stesso wafer (il V080404CF) fornito dall'University of California di Santa Barbara (UCSB); su questo wafer meta dei campioni presenti erano dotati di strato di passivazione superficiale: e stato possibile, quindi, anche valutare i vantaggi della passivazione. Entrando nel dettaglio delle misure di elettroluminescenza effettuate, si sono andati a produrre i tipici grafici a â€œcampanaâ€; si e valutato cioe l'entita dell'emissione prodotta in funzione 
dello stato di polarizzazione del dispositivo. Questi grafici si sono fatti per le varie â€œgeometrieâ€ di campioni disponibili sul wafer, cercando cosi di stabilire, in particolare, una relazione tra la distanza gate-drain LGD e la quantita di fotoni emessi dal dispositivo. Per quanto riguarda la caratterizzazione dinamica dei dispositivi si e proseguito con il lavoro gia fatto in una precedente tesi di laurea; si e andati a valutare fenomeni di collasso di corrente e shift di tensione di soglia ricavandoli dai grafici delle caratteristiche di uscita e transcaratteristiche ID-VG fatti a diverse tensioni VDS.

Performance Comparison of Machine Learning Methods with Distinct Features to Estimate Battery SOC,"As the world is moving towards using renewable energy sources for a greener environment, battery energy storage systems (BESS) has become an important issue because of the intermittent nature of renewable sources. The quantity associated with the amount of energy stored in battery at a certain time is called the batteryâ€™s State of Charge or SOC. Typically it is estimated with the assumption that it changes linearly with the quantities such as voltage, current etc. which can be measured effortlessly. But actually no such linear relationship exists. Machine learning techniques have proven to be useful for measuring SOC. Though the features that are conventionally used often suffer from a phenomenon called multicollinearity. Ridge and lasso regression methods have shown to counter the effects of multicollinearity. In this paper, these methods have been used along with linear regression, support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN). Besides readily available conventional features some nonconventional features are explored too that can be derived from conventional features. Results exhibit that nonconventional features boost the performance of all the methods except for SVM. Ridge regression method with nonconventional features has shown to generate the best outcome among all the scenarios taking both accuracy and speed of computation into account.",2019,2019 IEEE Green Energy and Smart Systems Conference (IGESSC)
Adaptive Robust Variable Selection.,"Heavy-tailed high-dimensional data are commonly encountered in various scientific fields and pose great challenges to modern statistical analysis. A natural procedure to address this problem is to use penalized quantile regression with weighted L1-penalty, called weighted robust Lasso (WR-Lasso), in which weights are introduced to ameliorate the bias problem induced by the L1-penalty. In the ultra-high dimensional setting, where the dimensionality can grow exponentially with the sample size, we investigate the model selection oracle property and establish the asymptotic normality of the WR-Lasso. We show that only mild conditions on the model error distribution are needed. Our theoretical results also reveal that adaptive choice of the weight vector is essential for the WR-Lasso to enjoy these nice asymptotic properties. To make the WR-Lasso practically feasible, we propose a two-step procedure, called adaptive robust Lasso (AR-Lasso), in which the weight vector in the second step is constructed based on the L1-penalized quantile regression estimate from the first step. This two-step procedure is justified theoretically to possess the oracle property and the asymptotic normality. Numerical studies demonstrate the favorable finite-sample performance of the AR-Lasso.",2014,Annals of statistics
