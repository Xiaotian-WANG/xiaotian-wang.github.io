"Palynological Investigation of the Albian to Lower Cenomanian Bima Formation, Bornu Basin, Nigeria","2 Abstract: The palynology of Bima Formation covering interval of 2900m to 3620m was studied with the view of determining the age and paleoenvironment of deposition of the sediments. The sequence (3620m-2900m) belongs to Afropollis jardinus assemblage zone characterised by co-occurrence of Afropollis jardinus, Classopollis brasiliensis, Forma PO 304 Lawal, Cretacaeiporites mulleri, Monosulcites sp. and Triorites africaensis. Other flora that that are stratigraphically important present in the interval include Elaterosporites klazii, Cretacaeiporite polygonalis, C. Mulleri, Galeacornea clavis, Liliacidites peroreticulatus, Hexaporotricolpites emelianovi and Ephedripites multicostatus. The Bima Formation is here dated Albian to Lower Cenomanian age based on the co-occurrence of these miospores. The paleoenvironment of deposition was deduced to vary with the lithologic facies. Also the basal unit is continental in nature and contains paucity of palynomorphs; the marginal marine system is characterized by diagnostic assemblage of dinoflagellate cysts such as Senegalinium bicavatum, Senegalinium sp, Batiacasphaera sp. and microforaminiferal wall lining while the upper sequence is devoid of organic wall microplankton.",2011,
On Fractional Deviation Operators,"The so called fractionaldeviationoperatorsare introduced.

Weighted Consensus Clustering,"Consensus clustering has emerged as an important extension of the classical clustering problem. We propose weighted consensus clustering, where each input clustering is weighted and the weights are determined in such a way that the final consensus clustering provides a better quality solution, in which clusters are better separated comparing to standard consensus clustering. Theoretically, we show that a reformulation of the wellknown L1 regularization LASSO problem is equivalent to the weight optimization of our weighted consensus clustering, and thus our approach provides sparse solutions which may resolve the difficult situation when the input clusterings diverge significantly. We also show that the weighted consensus clustering resolves the redundancy problem when many input clusterings correlate highly. Detailed algorithms are given. Experiments are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the weighted consensus clustering.",2008,
"TREVOR HASTIE, ROBERT TIBSHIRANI, AND MARTIN WAINWRIGHT. Statistical Learning with Sparsity: The Lasso and Generalizations. Boca Raton: CRC Press","Regularization has played a major role in statistics ever since the new era of data generation has reached its foothold. During this period analyzed data sets started having many more features than observations, which made standard statistical methods inconvenient. Perhaps the most widely used and well-known regularization method today is the â€œLeast Absolute Selection and Shrinkage Operator,â€ better known simply as the Lasso. This method was originally introduced by Robert Tibshirani in 1996 and further popularized as part of the highly accessed book â€œThe Elements of Statistical Learningâ€ in 2001, written by some of the same authors as the book described here. It is therefore needless to say that the authors of â€œStatistical Learning with Sparsityâ€ comprise valued experts on this topic. With their most recent book, the authors aim to provide a broad overview on classical concepts of regularization in statistics as well as the newest trends in this direction. In our opinion, the book succeeds in providing a comprehensive guideline on this topic that is well-suited for teachers as well as students, more precise reasons will be given at the end of the review. The book starts off with a general introduction to the field that describes the idea behind sparsity in modeling. The concepts are demonstrated nicely with two real-world examples that illustrate the results from applying a regularized model. The first chapter of a book is important as it often decides whether one continues interest in the book, or drops it and shops for something else. In this case, the attention of the reader is immediately captured, and even enhanced, by the well-chosen examples. The book then goes on to introduce regularization in generalized linear models in the following two chapters, where standard classical works are reviewed. What immediately jumps to attention is the completeness of discussion of single topics. Equations are not only provided and discussed, they are complemented by examples that",2018,
Identifying Influential Factors to Residential Vacancy in Seoul Based on a Geographically Weighted Lasso Model,"Recently, the number of vacant houses is increasing in large cities in Korea. In order to reduce vacant houses, it needs to figure out the distribution of vacant houses and identify the influential factors on it. We identified the factors influencing residential vacancy in Seoul by considering variables regarding regional deterioration and urban redevelopment. In addition, we used a Geographically Weighted Lasso model to select the spatial heterogeneous influential factors and reduce multicollinearity. As a result, based on â€˜the approval level of the management disposal planâ€™, there were the negative correlations with the vacancy occurrence at the previous stages and the positive correlations with the vacancy occurrence at the later stages. The rate of shutout report and the net migration are positively correlated with vacancy occurrence, while the variation in floating population is negatively correlated with it. Our studyÂ can provide meaningful information for the planning for vacant house management.",2018,

"Age Discrimination at Texas Roadhouse, Inc","The Texas Roadhouse Experience Texas Roadhouse's YouTube videos offered great exposure for the restaurant chain, but they also illustrated a potentially ominous legal threat. One video showed an attractive young woman as she circled her hand above her head as she and her coworkers strutted and turned to the strains of ""Save a Horse, Ride a Cowboy."" ""Now lasso four times as you turn to face the wall ..."" YouTube viewers wanting to learn the popular line dance were practicing at home, so they could join the dancing the next time they went to their Texas Roadhouse restaurant. But not all YouTube viewers saw the Roadhouse in the same positive light. Some viewed a video of P. David Lopez, General Counsel of the U. S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which announced that a nationwide lawsuit had been filed against Texas Roadhouse for ""a pattern or practice of age discrimination in hiring hourly, front of the house employees"" at the chain's casual dining restaurants. Mentioning the increase in age discrimination claims filed with the agency since 2007, Lopez explained the legal action, ""It's important in this difficult economic climate that we redouble our nation's commitment to the principle of nondiscrimination in the workplace, to ensure that hiring decisions are based on abilities, not age"" (EEOC, 2011). The Texas Roadhouse website described the chain as family restaurants with ""legendary food, legendary service, and legendary good times"" Although specializing in hand-cut steaks, ribs, home-baked bread, and large portions, its appeal was definitely enhanced by the line dances every hour led by the servers and other front of the house ""team members."" This boisterous entertainment distinguished the Roadhouse restaurants from their larger competitors like Lone Star and Outback, and made the ""Roadies"" an essential part of the restaurant's success. Roadies were expected to be energetic, and to have a ""passion for fun."" National line dancing competitions for Roadhouse local dance teams were held annually, with many local teams creating their own dances. In 2007, as job markets tightened across the country, applications for entry-level jobs at restaurants increased from older, unemployed people who might not have considered such low-paying jobs before the downturn. The EEOC reported a rise in age-discrimination complaints, and a number of these cases charged the Texas Roadhouse with discriminating in its hiring practices for front of the house employees. ""Front of the house"" referred to the servers, bartenders, greeters, and other publicly visible employees in restaurants. These positions were traditionally jobs held by the young. Many of these jobs were part-time and evening jobs requiring little experience and were well-suited to college students or those not yet focused on a career. History of the Texas Roadhouse Chain W. Kent Taylor founded Texas Roadhouse in Indiana in 1993. After a few lean years, Taylor attracted some additional capital, developed a successful business model that included the line-dancing Roadies, and Texas Roadhouse expanded rapidly. Taylor decided to expand into smaller secondary markets, thus avoiding direct competition with Outback restaurants, a major competitor. Markets were selected that had a high blue-collar population. As one investor told Chain Leader magazine, Roadhouse was ""a redneck Outback"" (Farkas, 2003). By 2012, the corporation had over 300 restaurants, and had expanded globally with the first Roadhouse in Dubai. The decor of the restaurants was Southwestern with Native American murals on the walls and buckets of peanuts at every table. In 2002, country singer Willie Nelson became the official spokesman for the chain, and a ""Willie's Corner"" selling the singer's merchandise was in every restaurant. Nelson's outlaw image became an important part of the Roadhouse aura. In a video commercial, CEO Kent Taylor spoofed the television show Undercover Boss by arriving at a Roadhouse in cowboy hat with long Willie Nelson braids and bandana. â€¦",2014,Journal of Critical Incidents
Primal-Dual Rates and Certificates,"We propose an algorithm-independent framework to equip existing optimization methods with primal-dual certificates. Such certificates and corresponding rate of convergence guarantees are important for practitioners to diagnose progress, in particular in machine learning applications. We obtain new primal-dual convergence rates, e.g., for the Lasso as well as many L1, Elastic Net, group Lasso and TV-regularized problems. The theory applies to any norm-regularized generalized linear model. Our approach provides efficiently computable duality gaps which are globally defined, without modifying the original problems in the region of interest.",2016,
A machine learning approach for predictive models of adverse events following spine surgery.,"BACKGROUND
Rates of adverse events following spine surgery vary widely by patient-, diagnosis-, and procedure-related factors. It is critical to understand the expected rates of complications and to be able to implement targeted efforts at limiting these events.


PURPOSE
To develop and evaluate a set of predictive models for common adverse events after spine surgery.


STUDY DESIGN
A retrospective cohort study PATIENT SAMPLES: We extracted 345,510 patients from the Truven MarketScan (MKS) and MarketScan Medicaid Databases and 760,724 patients from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Medicare database who underwent spine surgeries between 2009 and 2013.


OUTCOME MEASURES
Overall adverse event (AE) occurrence and types of AE occurrence during the 30-day post-operative follow-up.


METHODS
We applied a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regularization method and a logistic regression approach for predicting the risks of an overall AE and the top six most commonly observed AEs. Predictors included patient demographics, location of the spine procedure, comorbidities, type of surgery performed, and pre-operative diagnosis.


RESULTS
The median ages of MKS and CMS patients were 49 years and 69, respectively. The most frequent individual AE was a cardiac dysfunction in CMS (10.6%) patients and a pulmonary complication (4.7%) in MKS. The AUC of a prediction model for an overall AE was 0.7. Among the six individual prediction models, the model for predicting the risk of a pulmonary complication showed the greatest accuracy (AUC 0.76), and the range of AUC for these six models was 0.7 and 0.76. Medicaid status was one of the most important factors in predicting the occurrences of AEs; Medicaid recipients had increased odds of AEs by 20-60% compared to non-Medicaid patients (odds ratios: 1.28-1.6; P<10-10). Logistic regression showed higher AUCs than LASSO across these different models.


CONCLUSIONS
We present a set of predictive models for AEs following spine surgery that account for patient-, diagnosis-, and procedure-related factors which can contribute to patient-counseling, accurate risk adjustment, and accurate quality metrics.",2019,The spine journal : official journal of the North American Spine Society
Regularized Multinomial Regression Method for Hyperspectral Data Classification via Pathwise Coordinate Optimization,"Hyperspectral imagery generally contains enormous amounts of data due to hundreds of spectral bands. As recent researchers have discovered, many of the bands are highly correlated and may provide redundant information for the classification related problems. Therefore, feature selection is very important in hyperspectral image processing problem. ''Pathwise Coordinate Descent'' algorithm is the ''one-at-a-time'' coordinate-wise descent algorithm for a class of convex optimization problems. When applied on the L1-regularized regression (lasso) problem, the algorithm can handle large problems and can also efficiently obtain sparse features in a comparatively very low timing cost. Through computing the solutions for a decreasing sequence of regularization parameters, the algorithm also combines model selection procedure into itself. In this paper, we utilize the multinomial logistic regression with lasso, elastic-net convex penalties on hyperspectral image classification. Pathwise Coordinate Descent is used for estimation these models. Experimental results demonstrate that, in the context of the hyperspectral data classification problem, models obtained by Pathwise Coordinate Descent algorithm do effectively achieve a sparse feature subsets and very good classification results with very low computational costs.",2009,2009 Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications

Learning to Learn for Structured Sparsity,"Structured sparsity has recently emerged in statistics, machine learning and signal processing as a promising paradigm for learning in high-dimensional settings. A number of methods have been proposed for learning under the assumption of structured sparsity, including group LASSO and graph LASSO. All of these methods rely on prior knowledge on how to weight (equivalently, how to penalize) individual subsets of variables during the subset selection process. However, these weights on groups of variables are in general unknown. Inferring group weights from data is a key open problem in research on structured sparsity. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian approach to the problem of group weight learning. We model the group weights as hyperparameters of heavy-tailed priors on groups of variables and derive an approximate inference scheme to infer these hyperparameters. We empirically show that we are able to recover the model hyperparameters when the data are generated from the model, and moreover, we demonstrate the utility of learning group weights in synthetic and real denoising problems.",2014,
"Heterologous and in Vitro Reconstitution of Fuscanodin, a Lasso Peptide from Thermobifida fusca.","Lasso peptides are a class of ribosomally derived natural products typified by their threaded rotaxane structure. The conversion of a linear precursor peptide into a lasso peptide structure requires two enzymatic activities: cleavage of the precursor via a cysteine protease and cyclization via isopeptide bond formation. In vitro studies of lasso peptide enzymology have been hampered by difficulties in obtaining pure, soluble enzymes. We reasoned that thermophilic bacteria would be a good source for well-behaved lasso peptide biosynthetic enzymes. The genome of the thermophilic actinobacterium Thermobifida fusca encodes for a lasso peptide with an unprecedented Trp residue at its N-terminus, a peptide we have named fuscanodin. Here we reconstitute fuscanodin biosynthesis in vitro with purified components, establishing a minimal fuscanodin synthetase. These experiments have allowed us to probe the kinetics of lasso peptide biosynthesis for the first time, and we report initial rates of fuscanodin biosynthesis. The fuscanodin biosynthetic enzymes are insensitive to substrate concentration and operate in a near single-turnover regime in vitro. While lasso peptides are often touted for their stability to both chaotropic and thermal challenges, fuscanodin is found to undergo a conformational change consistent with lasso peptide unthreading in organic solvents at room temperature.",2019,Journal of the American Chemical Society
A Two-Stage Method to Identify Joint Modules From Matched MicroRNA and mRNA Expression Data,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs, which play key roles in gene regulation. Previous studies have revealed that they are likely to work together to regulate their common target genes. Discovery of the underlying combinatorial regulation between miRNAs and genes can provide useful information for understanding their functions as well as their close relevance to cancer. In this paper, we propose a two-stage method for identifying miRNA-gene regulatory modules by integrating miRNA and mRNA expression profiles and miRNA genomic cluster data. We first develop a multiple-output sparse group lasso (MSGL) regression model to predict a miRNA-gene association matrix (i.e., a miRNA-gene regulatory network). Further, we propose a L0-regularized singular value decomposition (L0-SVD) to identify miRNA-gene joint modules from the predicted regulatory network. We test our method on the matched miRNA and mRNA expression profiles in breast cancer from TCGA project and identify ten miRNA-gene regulatory modules. We find that 1) the modules are significantly associated in the predicted miRNA-gene regulatory network; 2) the modules are significantly enriched in GO biological processes and KEGG pathways, respectively; 3) many miRNAs and genes in the modules are related with breast cancer. On average, 51% of the miRNAs and 30% of the genes are related with breast cancer. The results demonstrate that miRNA-gene regulatory modules provide insights into the mechanisms of the combinatorial regulation between miRNAs and genes.",2016,IEEE Transactions on NanoBioscience
Automatic Annotation of Radiological Observations in Liver CT Images,"We aim to predict radiological observations using computationally-derived imaging features extracted from computed tomography (CT) images. We created a dataset of 79 CT images containing liver lesions identified and annotated by a radiologist using a controlled vocabulary of 76 semantic terms. Computationally-derived features were extracted describing intensity, texture, shape, and edge sharpness. Traditional logistic regression was compared to L(1)-regularized logistic regression (LASSO) in order to predict the radiological observations using computational features. The approach was evaluated by leave one out cross-validation. Informative radiological observations such as lesion enhancement, hypervascular attenuation, and homogeneous retention were predicted well by computational features. By exploiting relationships between computational and semantic features, this approach could lead to more accurate and efficient radiology reporting.",2012,AMIA ... Annual Symposium proceedings.

[Maternal HIV infection and the anthropometric characteristics of children at birth in Burkina Faso. DITRAME Study Group].,"The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between maternal HIV status and the anthropometric characteristics of children at birth. A cross-sectional study was conducted in Bobo-Dioulasso from January 1995 to May 1996. We included all mother-child pairs seen postpartum for whom the HIV status of the mother had been determined at an antenatal visit and anthropometric measurements had been taken for the child at birth. Birth weights below 2,500 g were classed as ""low"", body lengths of less than 47 cm at birth were described as ""small birth size"" and head circumferences of less than 33 cm were classed as ""small"". We included 956 mothers and 956 children in the survey. Low birth-weights were recorded more frequently among children born to HIV-infected mothers than among those born to uninfected mothers (23. 37% versus 15.6%; p = 0.006). Mean birth-weight, birth size and head circumference did not differ significantly between the children of HIV-infected and uninfected mothers. In multivariate analysis, HIV infection and primiparity were independently associated with low birth-weight. Maternal HIV infection was the only factor associated with small birth size. There was no relationship between head circumference and maternal HIV status. Thus, maternal HIV infection appears to be associated with low birth-weight and small birth size.",1999,Sante

A semi-mechanism approach based on MRI and proteomics for prediction of conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimerâ€™s disease,"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a precursor phase of Alzheimer's disease (AD). As current treatments may be effective only at the early stages of AD, it is important to track MCI patients who will convert to AD. The aim of this study is to develop a high performance semi-mechanism based approach to predict the conversion from MCI to AD and improve our understanding of MCI-to-AD conversion mechanism. First, analysis of variance (ANOVA) test and lasso regression are employed to identify the markers related to the conversion. Then the Bayesian network based on selected markers is established to predict MCI-to-AD conversion. The structure of Bayesian network suggests that the conversion may start with fibrin clot formation, verbal memory impairment, eating pattern changing and hyperinsulinemia. The Bayesian network achieves a high 10-fold cross-validated prediction performance with 96% accuracy, 95% sensitivity, 65% specificity, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.82 on data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database.

Online joint classification and anomaly detection via sparse coding,"We present a novel convex scheme for simultaneous online fault classification and anomaly detection in a multivariate time-series setting. Our approach extends recent work on sparse coding and anomaly detection using an over-complete dictionary to problems where some taxonomy of anomalies already exists. The temporal aspect of the data is addressed by a simple sliding window approach; inspired by a group-LASSO penalisation approach, classification is treated by jointly sparsifying groups of the coefficients (the sparse coding) of dictionary atoms via â„“2;1 regularisation. The dictionary which drives the prediction and coding is assumed given and is learnable by a range of available prior algorithms. We demonstrate our framework on a classification and anomaly detection task on three-phase low-voltage time-series. In this case, we manually design our dictionary based on basic knowledge of common faults that affect low-voltage powerlines. For this reason our approach does not necessarily require a training stage.",2014,2014 IEEE International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)
"Laboratory Biomarkers, Cerebral Blood Flow Velocity, and Intellectual Function in Children with Sickle Cell Disease","Objective
The aim of this preliminary study was to describe putative markers of cerebral vasculopathy and investigate relationships among these markers, demographic factors, and cognitive function in a young sample of neurologically normal children with SCD. Study Design. Thirty-eight children with homozygous HbS, aged 4-11 years, were included. Estimated IQ and markers of coagulation and endothelial activation, hemolysis, and inflammation, as well as transcranial Doppler velocities, hydroxyurea use, and demographic information were obtained.


Results
Using multiple regression analyses, there were few significant independent associations between biomarkers or blood flow velocity and estimated IQ. Lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) independently predicted cognitive function, but blood flow velocity did not mediate this relationship. Maternal education, patient age, and hydroxyurea status were independent predictors of cognition. Given the small sample size, a LASSO statistical model was employed to further identify potential predictors of IQ, which identified LDH, absolute neutrophil count (ANC), platelet count, thrombin-antithrombin (TAT), tissue factor (TF), maternal education, age, and hydroxyurea as potential predictors of cognition.


Conclusions
In addition to effects of age and maternal education, some vasculopathic markers are associated with cognitive function in young children with SCD, and these relationships do not appear to be mediated through blood flow velocity. Although the lack of association among certain variables was not as predicted, results provide support for further research regarding the influence of vasculopathic markers on cognitive function in children with SCD without stroke, especially intravascular hemolysis and coagulation/endothelial activation, and a possible role for HU treatment in preventing or reversing cognitive decline.",2020,Advances in Hematology
Anthologizing the Atlantic Slave Trade Literature,"The ever-prolific Jeremy Black has assembled these four volumes of eighty five photo-reproduced articles in English. Ashgate, of course, specializes in this style of print reader and has produced a vast array of topically orga nized collections, supplementing the growing availability of at least some of the same materials in digital formats. (Readers of this journal will recall that more than ten years ago Patrick Manning published a similarly formatted collection centered on Africa, also through Ashgate/Variorum.)1 I have not confirmed Internet access to the entire collection, but scanning the sites from which the contents of these volumes were taken suggests that nearly all may also be downloaded. The essays included date from 1940 (John Blake on the English trade to the Portuguese empire in West Africa) through 2004 (Guillaume Daudin on profitability in the eighteenth-cen tury French trade). Three were published before 1960, seven in the 1960s, twenty in the 1970s, twenty-four in the 1980s, twenty-two in the 1990s, and eight after 2000. This is not the place to speculate on various publishers' marketing strategies aimed at instructors seeking print collections for col lege and university classes, but presumably commercial as well as academic considerations led to the exclusion of the considerable scholarship in French, Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, and Danish. Black opens each of the century-defined volumes with a short intro ductory essay placing the articles in their historical contexts. In the edi tor's vision, the articles fit into a general conceptual framework focusing on the challenges that Europeans eventually addressed by sailing captives across the Atlantic from Africa to the Americas. Examples include the role of disease in the demographic collapse of Native American populations and the contemporaneous expansion of commercialized serfdom in eastern Europe.

Intrinsic balancing in reconstruction of the tetraplegic hand.,"This article reviews 183 hand reconstructions in 135 consecutive tetraplegic patients. Comparisons were made between 103 extrinsic reconstructions with intrinsic balancing procedures and 80 extrinsic reconstructions without intrinsic balancing procedures. Extrinsic reconstructions (tendon transfers and tenodesis in the forearm muscles) were augmented by intrinsic reconstructive procedures (tendon transfers or tenodesis to improve the intrinsic balance of the fingers) in patients exhibiting digital imbalance. Intrinsic procedures included primarily the flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) lasso procedure or the intrinsic tenodesis procedure. The patients were stratified by level of spinal cord injury and by type of extrinsic and intrinsic reconstruction. Hands reconstructed with intrinsic balancing versus without intrinsic balancing, as well as intrinsic balancing using a FDS lasso procedure versus an intrinsic tenodesis procedure, were compared with patients with the same level of spinal cord function. Patients who underwent reconstructions with intrinsic balancing had more grip strength, by an average of 13-26 N, than those who did not undergo intrinsic balancing. When different intrinsic procedures were compared, there was improvement in grip strength and function in activities of daily living for all hands, but there was no significant difference between FDS lasso or intrinsic tenodesis procedures. The indications for intrinsic balancing during extrinsic reconstruction are developed into treatment algorithms based on the senior author's surgical experience. The authors recommended that digital intrinsic procedures be included in hand reconstruction for tetraplegic patients exhibiting intrinsic imbalance to help improve digital function and provide increased grip strength.",1997,The Journal of hand surgery
Adaptive Elastic Net GMM Estimation with Many Invalid Moment Conditions: Simultaneous Model and Moment Selection,"This paper develops the adaptive elastic net GMM estimator in large dimensional models with many possibly invalid moment conditions, where both the number of structural parameters and the number of moment conditions may increase with the sample size. The basic idea is to conduct the standard GMM estimation combined with two penalty terms: the quadratic regularization and the adaptively weighted lasso shrinkage. The new estimation procedure consistently selects both the nonzero structural parameters and the valid moment conditions. At the same time, it uses information only from the valid moment conditions to estimate the selected structural parameters and thus achieves the standard GMM efficiency bound as if we know the valid moment conditions ex ante. It is shown that the quadratic regularization is important to obtain the efficient estimator. We also study the tuning parameter choice, with which we show that selection consistency still holds without assuming Gaussianity. We apply the new estimation procedure to dynamic panel data models, where both the time and cross section dimensions are large. The new estimator is robust to possible serial correlations in the regression error terms. Keywords and phrases: Adaptive Elastic Net, GMM, many invalid moments, large dimensional models, efficiency bound, tuning parameter choice, dynamic panel.",2014,Journal of Business & Economic Statistics
"Acinetodin and Klebsidin, RNA Polymerase Targeting Lasso Peptides Produced by Human Isolates of Acinetobacter gyllenbergii and Klebsiella pneumoniae.","We report the bioinformatic prediction and structural validation of two lasso peptides, acinetodin and klebsidin, encoded by the genomes of several human-associated strains of Acinetobacter and Klebsiella. Computation of the three-dimensional structures of these peptides using NMR NOESY constraints verifies that they contain a lasso motif. Despite the lack of sequence similarity to each other or to microcin J25, a prototypical lasso peptide and transcription inhibitor from Escherichia coli, acinetodin and klebsidin also inhibit transcript elongation by the E. coli RNA polymerase by binding to a common site. Yet, unlike microcin J25, acinetodin and klebsidin are unable to permeate wild type E. coli cells and inhibit their growth. We show that the E. coli cells become sensitive to klebsidin when expressing the outer membrane receptor FhuA homologue from Klebsiella pneumoniae. It thus appears that specificity to a common target, the RNA polymerase secondary channel, can be attained by a surprisingly diverse set of primary sequences folded into a common threaded-lasso fold. In contrast, transport into cells containing sensitive targets appears to be much more specific and must be the major determinant of the narrow range of bioactivity of known lasso peptides.",2017,ACS chemical biology

Discovery and characterization of a novel C-terminal peptide carboxyl methyltransferase in a lassomycin-like lasso peptide biosynthetic pathway,"Lasso peptides belong to a peculiar family of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs)â€”natural products with an unusual isopeptide-bonded slipknot structure. Except for assembling of this unusual lasso fold, several further post-translational modifications of lasso peptides, including C-terminal methylation, phosphorylation/poly-phosphorylation, citrullination, and acetylation, have been reported recently. However, most of their biosynthetic logic have not been elucidated except the phosphorylated paeninodin lasso peptide. Herein, we identified two novel lassomycin-like lasso peptide biosynthetic pathways and, for the first time, characterized a novel C-terminal peptide carboxyl methyltransferase involved in these pathways. Our investigations revealed that this new family of methyltransferase could specifically methylate the C terminus of precursor peptide substrates, eventually leading to lassomycin-like C-terminal methylated lasso peptides. Our studies offer another rare insight into the extraordinary strategies of chemical diversification adopted by lasso peptide biosynthetic machinery and predicated two valuable sources for methylated lasso peptide discovery.",2019,Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology
Adaptive L1/2 Shooting Regularization Method for Survival Analysis Using Gene Expression Data,A new adaptive Lâ‚/â‚‚ shooting regularization method for variable selection based on the Cox's proportional hazards mode being proposed. This adaptive Lâ‚/â‚‚ shooting algorithm can be easily obtained by the optimization of a reweighed iterative series of Lâ‚ penalties and a shooting strategy of Lâ‚/â‚‚ penalty. Simulation results based on high dimensional artificial data show that the adaptive Lâ‚/â‚‚ shooting regularization method can be more accurate for variable selection than Lasso and adaptive Lasso methods. The results from real gene expression dataset (DLBCL) also indicate that the Lâ‚/â‚‚ regularization method performs competitively.,2013,The Scientific World Journal
Contemporary Arab Women Writers: Cultural Expression in Context,"Anastasia Valassopoulosâ€™s study sets itself the ambitious aim of wresting Arab womenâ€™s writing from some of the reductive frameworks that have hampered existing criticism in order to read literary texts at once for their formal experimentation and for their theoretical innovation. The book opens with the observation that Arab womenâ€™s texts have too often been read appreciatively and condescendingly, with a lack of proper conceptual analysis. Valassopoulosâ€™s response to this deficiency is to assess her chosen works as â€œcultural expression in contextâ€, which means that she pays due attention to their socio-political contexts without reducing the works to these contexts, and that she also explores the ways in which they engage with wider issues. Refusing to overemphasise questions of faith and ethnicity, for example, she argues that her texts should be read â€œfor their experiences of location, cultural influence, the expression of national identity, the experience of sexuality, the performance of gender roles and the interrogation of and responses to colonial discourse and postcolonial theoryâ€ (p. 4). This broad understanding of context not just as the socio-political backdrop, but also the whole arena of theoretical and cultural considerations that impact on Arab women writers leads to a series of highly intelligent, dynamic and engaging readings. There is no specific agenda or hobby horse guiding this study, then, but a commitment to the complexity of the texts themselves, together with a subtle grasp of the range of critical debates with which they can be seen to engage. The first chapter focuses on the notion of womenâ€™s writing, and serves both as a lucid introductory framework for the readings that follow and as a provocative dialogue with feminist studies more broadly. Valassopoulos examines a series of existing approaches to Arab womenâ€™s writing and identifies the pitfalls of various sorts of feminist criticism. She reveals, for example, the dangers of applying too specific a feminist framework to Arab literature, since this can result in the misapplication of Western feminist modes of thinking (such as a focus on the individual) on the Arab context. Conversely, however, she notes that there is no contestatory â€œArab feminismâ€ as such, since the very term has been associated with â€œthe Westâ€ in contradistinction to â€œthe Eastâ€, and, in any case, â€œthere is still â€˜no fully acceptableâ€™ term for feminism or feminist in Arabicâ€ (p. 20). Moreover, feminist post-colonial theory, which sets out precisely to deal with these sorts of issues, has, according to Valassopoulos, still JOURNAL FOR CULTURAL RESEARCH VOLUME 16 NUMBER 2â€“3 (APRILâ€“JULY 2012)",2012,Journal for Cultural Research
From the skin-depth equation to the inverse RFEC sensor model,"In this paper, we tackle the direct and inverse problems for the Remote-Field Eddy-Current (RFEC) technology. The direct problem is the sensor model, where given the geometry the measurements are obtained. Conversely, the inverse problem is where the geometry needs to be estimated given the field measurements. These problems are particularly important in the field of Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) because they allow assessing the quality of the structure monitored. We solve the direct problem in a parametric fashion using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operation (LASSO). The proposed inverse model uses the parameters from the direct model to recover the thickness using least squares producing the optimal solution given the direct model. This study is restricted to the 2D axisymmetric scenario. Both, direct and inverse models, are validated using a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) environment with realistic pipe profiles.",2016,"2016 14th International Conference on Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision (ICARCV)"
Markers of Neuroinflammation Associated with Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Pathology in Older Adults,"BACKGROUND: In vitro and animal studies have linked neuroinflammation to Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) pathology. Studies on markers of inflammation in subjects with mild cognitive impairment or AD dementia provided inconsistent results. We hypothesized that distinct blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) inflammatory markers are associated with biomarkers of amyloid and tau pathology in older adults without cognitive impairment or with beginning cognitive decline. OBJECTIVE: To identify blood-based and CSF neuroinflammation marker signatures associated with AD pathology (i.e. an AD CSF biomarker profile) and to investigate associations of inflammation markers with CSF biomarkers of amyloid, tau pathology, and neuronal injury. DESIGN/METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis was performed on data from 120 older community-dwelling adults with normal cognition (n = 48) or with cognitive impairment (n = 72). CSF AÎ²1-42, tau and p-tau181, and a panel of 37 neuroinflammatory markers in both CSF and serum were quantified. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was applied to determine a reference model that best predicts an AD CSF biomarker profile defined a priori as p-tau181/AÎ²1-42 ratio >0.0779. It was then compared to a second model that included the inflammatory markers from either serum or CSF. In addition, the correlations between inflammatory markers and CSF AÎ²1-42, tau and p-tau181 levels were assessed. RESULTS: Forty-two subjects met criteria for having an AD CSF biomarker profile. The best predictive models included 8 serum or 3 CSF neuroinflammatory markers related to cytokine mediated inflammation, vascular injury, and angiogenesis. Both models improved the accuracy to predict an AD biomarker profile when compared to the reference model. In analyses separately performed in the subgroup of participants with cognitive impairment, adding the serum or the CSF neuroinflammation markers also improved the accuracy of the diagnosis of AD pathology. None of the inflammatory markers correlated with the CSF AÎ²1-42 levels. Six CSF markers (IL-15, MCP-1, VEGFR-1, sICAM1, sVCAM-1, and VEGF-D) correlated with the CSF tau and p-tau181 levels, and these associations remained significant after controlling for age, sex, cognitive impairment, and APOEÎµ4 status. CONCLUSIONS: The identified serum and CSF neuroinflammation biomarker signatures improve the accuracy of classification for AD pathology in older adults. Our results suggest that inflammation, vascular injury, and angiogenesis as reflected by CSF markers are closely related to cerebral tau pathology.",2016,Alzheimer's & Dementia

The Effect of Climate Variability on Main Components of Cow Milk in Iran,"The main purpose of this study is to assess the relationship between six bioclimatic indices for cattle (temperature humidity (THI), environmental stress (ESI), equivalent temperature (ESI), heat load (HLI), modified heat load (HLInew) and respiratory rate predictor(RRP)) and fundamental milk components (fat, protein, and milk yield) considering uncertainty. The climate parameters used to calculate the climate indices were taken from the NASA-Modern Era Retrospective-Analysis for Research and Applications (NASA-MERRA) reanalysis from 2002 to 2010. Cow milk data were considered for the same period from April to September when cows use natural pasture, with possibility for cows to choose to stay in the barn or to graze on the pasture in the pasturing system. The study is based on a linear regression analysis using correlations as a summarizing diagnostic. Bootstrapping is used to represent uncertainty estimation through resampling in the confidence intervals. To find the relationships between climate indices (THI, ETI, HLI, HLInew, ESI and RRP) and main components of cow milk (fat, protein and yield), multiple liner regression is applied. The least absolute shrinkage selection operator (LASSO) and the Akaike information criterion (AIC) techniques are applied to select the best model for milk predictands with the smallest number of climate predictors. Cross validation is used to avoid over-fitting. Based on results of investigation the effect of heat stress indices on milk compounds separately, we suggest the use of ESI and RRP in the summer and ESI in the spring. THI and HLInew are suggested for fat content and HLInew also is suggested for protein content in the spring season. The best linear models are found in spring between milk yield as predictands and THI, ESI,HLI, ETI and RRP as predictors with p-value < 0.001 and R2 0.50, 0.49. In summer, milk yield with independent variables of THI, ETI and ESI show the highest relation (p-value < 0.001) with R2 (0.69). For fat and protein the results are only marginal. It is strongly suggested that new and significant indices are needed to control critical heat stress conditions that consider more predictors of the effect of climate variability on animal products, such as sunshine duration, quality of pasture, the number of days of stress (NDS), the color of skin with attention to large black spots, and categorical predictors such as breed, welfare facility, and management system. This methodology is suggested for studies investigating the impacts of climate variability/change on food quality/security, animal science and agriculture using short term data considering uncertainty or data collection is expensive, difficult, or data with gaps.",2016,
"Sperm Economy in a Coral Reef Fish, Thalassoma Bifasciatum","In many coral reef fishes, males face the evolutionary problems of how to allocate sperm among frequent, daily mating in order to maximize the number of eggs they fertilize. A method is developed and tested for collecting and counting the number of sperm and eggs released during separate spawns of the coral reef fish Thalassoma bifasciatum. The method was used to examine the pattern of sperm allocation for pairâ€” and groupâ€”spawning males. The number of sperm released by pairâ€”spawning males varied positively with the number of eggs released by their female mates and with female body size. The data suggest that males economize on sperm release by providing the minimum amount of sperm needed to fertilize the egg clutch of the female partner. Fertilization efficiency (the number of eggs fertilized by a given number of sperm) was higher with large females than it was with small females. Males differed significantly among themselves in sperm output per spawn, with some males consistently releasing more sperm than other males with sameâ€”sized females. Maleâ€”male differences were not due to differences in male body size, quality of the spawning site, or the apparent degree of water movement. The number of sperm released per spawn did not decline throughout the daily spawning period, a pattern that disproved one but not all possible patterns of sperm depletion. In group spawns, the total number of sperm released and the number released per male were respectively 50 and 6 times the number released in pair spawns, on average. Both of these measures increased significantly with the clutch size of the spawning female. Overall, sperm production is probably sufficiently costly that males have been selected to allocate sperm carefully among their frequent daily spawns.",1994,Ecology

Palynostratigraphy and vegetation history of the Triassicâ€“Jurassic transition in East Greenland,"We present a palynological study of a terrestrial Triassicâ€“Jurassic (Trâ€“J; c . 200â€‰Ma) boundary section at Astartekloft, East Greenland. We have generated a new palynostratigraphic scheme and vegetation history for this locality, and have integrated these with existing carbon isotope records. Samples for palynological analysis were collected from precisely the same stratigraphic horizons as plant macrofossils and samples used for geochemical analyses. Our results highlight four local sporomorph assemblage zones that are compositionally distinct from each other at Astartekloft. The extremely low abundance of Classopollis pollen in all samples, and the pronounced decline of Ricciisporites tuberculatus during the Late Rhaetian are notable features of the sporomorph record of Trâ€“J vegetation at Astartekloft. Correlation of Astartekloft and a marine Trâ€“J boundary section at St Audrieâ€™s Bay, UK, provides no support for the idea that extinction and diversity loss in terrestrial ecosystems preceded biotic change in marine ecosystems at the Trâ€“J. Instead, the available data support suggestions that the onset of the Trâ€“J biotic crisis was synchronous in terrestrial and marine environments. Peak extinction among plants at Astartekloft occurred relatively late in the sequence of events across the Trâ€“J, and may represent a response to long-term cumulative effects of volcanism at this time.

Advances in variable selection and visualization methods for analysis of multivariate data,"This thesis concerns the analysis of multivariate data. The amount of data that is obtained from various sources and stored in digital media is growing at an exponential rate. The data sets tend to be too large in terms of the number of variables and the number of observations to be analyzed by hand. In order to facilitate the task, the data set must be summarized somehow. This work introduces machine learning methods that are capable of finding interesting patterns automatically from the data. The findings can be further used in decision making and prediction. The results of this thesis can be divided into three groups. The first group of results is related to the problem of selecting a subset of input variables in order to build an accurate predictive model for several response variables simultaneously. Variable selection is a difficult combinatorial problem in essence, but the relaxations examined in this work transform it into a more tractable optimization problem of continuous-valued parameters. The main contribution here is extending several methods that are originally designed for a single response variable to be applicable with multiple response variables as well. Examples of such methods include the well known lasso estimate and the least angle regression algorithm. The second group of results concerns unsupervised variable selection, where all variables are treated equally without making any difference between responses and inputs. The task is to detect the variables that contain, in some sense, as much information as possible. A related problem that is also examined is combining the two major categories of dimensionality reduction: variable selection and subspace projection. Simple modifications of the multiresponse regression techniques developed in this thesis offer a fresh approach to these unsupervised learning tasks. This is another contribution of the thesis. The third group of results concerns extensions and applications of the self-organizing map (SOM). The SOM is a prominent tool in the initial exploratory phase of multivariate analysis. It provides a clustering and a visual low-dimensional representation of a set of high-dimensional observations. Firstly, an extension of the SOM algorithm is proposed in this thesis, which is applicable to strongly curvilinear but intrinsically low-dimensional data structures. Secondly, an application of the SOM is proposed to interpret nonlinear quantile regression models. Thirdly, a SOM-based method is introduced for analyzing the dependency of one multivariate data set on another. Simila, T.

Characterizing CD137 upregulation on NK cells in patients receiving monoclonal antibody therapy,"Background
In the era of personalized cancer medicine, identifying techniques for effectively matching patients to efficacious treatments is a critical step in the treatment process. The advent of anti-cancer immunotherapies necessitates novel approaches to biomarker identification beyond traditional genomic profiling. One promising approach is incorporation of nomograms into treatment decisions. Nomograms are prediction tools, based on statistical modeling, designed to predict treatment outcomes. As a first step toward developing a nomogram, we conducted analyses to predict CD137 expression of natural killer cells after monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment.


Patients and methods
Patient, tumor and immune characteristics were collected from 199 patients with breast cancer (Nâ€‰=â€‰62), head/neck cancers (Nâ€‰=â€‰46) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) (Nâ€‰=â€‰91), who were receiving mAb therapy as part of clinical trials. The difference in CD137 expression before and after mAb therapy was assessed by flow cytometry. To evaluate those who respond to mAb therapy via increased CD137 expression, we applied classification and regression trees (CART), multivariable lasso regression tools and Random Forest.


Results
The CD137 expression was significantly different for each cancer type [mean (SD): Breast: 6.6 (6.5); Head/Neck: 11.0 (7.0); NHL: 7.5 (7.1), Pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001]. For breast cancer and NHL, FcR polymorphism and baseline CD137 expression were significant predictors of increased CD137 expression; for head/neck cancer, FcR polymorphism and age were significant predictors of increased expression.


Conclusions
Our preliminary results suggest that FcR polymorphism, pre-treatment CD137 expression and age are significant predictors of CD137 upregulation in patients. This study demonstrates that the development of a nomogram for therapy response is feasible. Further work validating our models in an independent cohort will provide the next steps in developing a nomogram that may be used to individualize this therapeutic approach for patients (NCT01114256).",2017,Annals of Oncology
Robustezza Di Sistemi Intelaiati Misti Acciaio-Calcestruzzo: Il Caso Di Collasso Di Una Colonna // Robustness Of Framed Steel-concrete Composite Systems: The Case Of A Column Collapse,"Negli ultimi anni, la ricerca di soluzioni costruttive finalizzate alla mitigazione dei danni causati da eventi eccezionali ha suscitato un 
grande interesse da parte della comunita scientifica internazionale. Tali azioni possono essere fronteggiate sia attraverso criteri di 
sovraresistenza che di ridondanza strutturale e la combinazione di questi criteri puo portare alla definizione di metodi di progetto 
efficaci ed economicamente efficienti. Uno dei principali obiettivi delle strategie di intervento e quello di realizzare sistemi strutturali 
in grado di attivare meccanismi di ridistribuzione dei carichi in modo che questi possano essere trasferiti, dalla parte danneggiata alla 
parte non danneggiata della struttura. Il lavoro svolto fa parte di un Progetto di Ricerca Europeo che ha l'obiettivo di definire nuovi 
criteri di progetto per strutture miste acciaio-calcestruzzo nei confronti di azioni eccezionali. La prima parte della ricerca si concentra 
sul comportamento di due telai 3-D nei confronti del collasso di una colonna interna. Due prove a scala reale saranno eseguite su una 
parte di queste strutture. Simulando il collasso completo di una colonna sara possibile studiare la ridondanza del sistema

condotto in fase di progetto delle prove. // The last years were characterized by a growing interest about the development of strategies for the mitigation of the damages caused 
by accidental events. Accidental actions can be resisted by residual strength and alternate load path methods and combination of 
these strategies can lead to an effective and cost efficient design procedure for progressive collapse mitigation by redistributing the 
loads within the structure. One of the main objective of these strategies is the development of structural systems able to activate 
mechanisms to transfer the loads from the damaged to the undamaged part of the structure. This paper illustrates the preliminary 
work carried on within a European Research Project, aimed at developing new design concepts for steel-concrete composite frames 
against accidental actions. The first part of the study investigates the behavior of two geometrically different steel-concrete 3-D 
composite frames subjected to the loss of an internal column. Two full-scale experimental tests will be performed on a part of these 
structure. By simulating the total loss of the impacted column, the experiments enable investigation of the redundancy of the 3-D slab

Graft Recovery Estimation at Transplantation (GREAT) Algorithm Identifies the Most Important Risk Factors for Primary Graft Dysfunction for Heart Transplantation,"Purpose Primary Graft Dysfunction (PGD) is the most prevalent cause of one-month mortality following heart transplant(1). With the increase need to use marginal donor, because of the limited pool of donor available, an algorithm to predict PGD following heart transplantation could help identify marginal donors that are still suitable for transplantation. Methods 64 patients who underwent heart transplantation procedure without the use of organ care system were analyzed. PGD was defined as described before (2) and was present in 21. Donor, procedural and Recipient factors were run in an machine learning algorithm with lasso regression based on the coordinate descent technique provided by the glmnet algorithm. The predictive algorithm was generated for the outcome Primary Graft Dysfunction by continuous cross-referencing and re-sampling. Depending on the importance and distribution of each predictor in the model was assigned a score. The sum score was tested in a ROC-analysis with optimal cut-off calculated Results The following variables were found to be high risk to develop PGD (in descendant order): Cardiopulmonary bypass time, units of red blood cells given, cold ischemia time, cardioplegia amount, Time from brain death to recovery, Troponin T level in donor, diabetes in recipient and post-op creatinine level were left for the final algorithm. Scores were assigned in proportion to the weight given to them in the algorithm.). A ROC- analyze for the prediction of PGD showed a AUC (95% conf interval) 0.93(0.86-0.99). The optimal cut off was determined at 10 (0-29) Conclusion GREAT score can intra -operatively be used to prepare the transplantation team for who needs post-procedural support.",2019,Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation

Developments in Low Cost Optical Detection and Signal Processing for Laser,"Laser ultrasonics is an emerging non-destructive testing technique. It offers several advantages over conventional water-jet ultrasound inspection, including improved spatial resolution, scanning speed and ability to inspect complex shaped components. Presented in the first part of the paper are the developments of a low cost optical detector for laser ultrasonics based on the photo-EMF (electromotive force) principles with a relatively inexpensive CW laser, and the detector performance tested using aluminium and carbon fibre composite panels with ultrasound generated by a conventional piezoelectric (PZT) transducer. Whilst the photo-EMF detector is shown to have the advantage of compactness and simple optical design, it is seen to suffer from low sensitivity. The signals obtained are overwhelmed by noise, particularly those obtained from low reflectivity composite materials, making it difficult to take proper measurement of ultrasonic attenuation and time-of-flight. A simple and effective way to improve signal quality will be to reduce noise by averaging of multiple laser ultrasonic waveforms, but this will significantly reduce scanning speed and potentially cause surface damage. Hence, this leads to the developments in signal processing presented in the second part of the paper. By employing the continuous wavelet transform and kurtosis information to enhance echo features and to suppress the influence of noise respectively in the high-order time-scale domain, an automatic method is presented for the estimation of ultrasonic attenuation and time-of-flight from a single shot laser ultrasonic waveform, and the estimation is shown to be in agreement with those measured from the averaged laser ultrasonic waveforms. The work is not only encouraging in demonstrating improved utilisation of low cost optical detectors, but also the techniques can be applied to any noisy ultrasound signals such as those received from thick and/or multi-layered components. Introduction: Laser ultrasonics [1-2] offers significant advantages over conventional â€œwater-jetâ€ ultrasound inspection, e.g. spatial resolution, sensitivity and, most notably, speed. This latter characteristic becomes especially dominant in the case of complex geometry structures where ten-fold (or more) increases in testing throughput have been reported. The increasing use of such structures for modern aircrafts has seen an increasing adoption of laser ultrasonics by the aerospace industry. Laser ultrasonics offers the potential to save on the costs of inspection by reducing inspection times and avoiding the necessity to construct complex scanning equipment for complex geometry components. The advantages of laser ultrasonics over conventional water jet ultrasonic scanning include: a) it is non-contacting and does not require complex transducer mounting jigs. b) it can access complex geometrical shapes, due to its capability to operate over a wide range of detection angles. c) there is no requirement for a coupling fluid to improve efficiency. d) it offers high resolution compared to contact transducers. e) it can provide a broadband flat frequency response and hence improve depth resolution, which is difficult to achieve for contact transducers, especially at high frequencies. f) large components can be scanned rapidly. A laser ultrasound system fundamentally consists of two distinct aspects, namely, laser generation of ultrasound in the test material, and laser detection of ultrasound. In laser ultrasonics the transducers that are used to generate and detect the ultrasound in conventional water-jet C-scan inspection are replaced by a generation laser and a detection laser. Whilst, ideally, these two roles would be achieved by one and the same laser, in practice this is not possible, since the requirements for generation are totally distinct from those for laser detection. However, the properties of one will impact on the performance requirements of the other e.g: the sensitivity of the detection system will help to determine the energy requirements of the generation laser. In general, sensitive optical detection systems are expensive and are either optically complex (e.g confocal Fabry-Perot systems requiring active stabilisation) and often require the use of complex expensive single longitudinal mode long pulse laser systems. The paper presents the attempt made to develop a compact and low cost optical detection system for laser ultrasonics, based on the photo-EMF (electromotive force) principles with a relatively inexpensive continuous wave (CW) laser, and a novel signal processing method employing the kurtosis information in the wavelet domain to enhance ultrasonic echoes [3-4]. Photo-EMF Detection: The principles of photo-EMF detection was first described by Sokolev and Stepanov [5-6]. It is a solid-state device, similar to a conventional semiconductor optical detector, which develops and stores an internal electric field that reproduces the spatial intensity pattern of the incident illumination. When the intensity pattern moves or vibrates laterally, the stored space-charge field drives a time-varying current through the electrical contacts on either side of the detector. This current can then be amplified in the normal way to produce the output signal. Physically, the detector consists of a photo-conductive crystal (GaAs:Cr crystal in the Lasson detector) [7]. In its application to laser ultrasound detection, the detector is arranged as part of a normal homodyne reference beam interferometer [8-9]. The signal and reference beams are combined at a small angle (typically 1.5 degrees) within the interferometer and generate an intensity fringe pattern on the surface of the crystal. Photocarriers are produced in the high intensity regions of the fringe pattern and these diffuse away from the high intensity regions, become trapped, and form a stationary charge pattern which generates a stationary space charge field. In the absence of a change in the light intensity pattern no net current flows through the external circuit. If the movement or modulation of the light intensity is slow (dependent on the carrier response time of the material) then the space charge distribution will track the fringe pattern movement and again no resulting current will be generated. However, when the intensity pattern is modulated by fast displacements (such as high frequency ultrasound), the fringes will move relative to the stationary space charge distribution and a current will be generated. The detector thus has the ability to sense high frequency ultrasound displacements while compensating or adapting for low frequency disturbances, such as those caused by environmental vibrations. This compensation frequency range is typically up to 100kHz, which is adequate for most rigid body/environmental disturbances, whereas the ultrasonic frequency response of this type of detector is inversely proportional to the carrier recombination time and can be as high as 30MHz. The bandwidth is limited by the electronics and in the present system the detector electronics have a bandwidth of 10MHz. Detector modules offering higher electronic bandwidths (to 25MHz) are available. The principal advantage of this type of detector is that it is compact and combines optical compensation and detection as well as electronic post-processing in one semiconductor element. Other advantages are: â€¢ It collects light from several speckles and is, therefore, suited to rough surfaces. â€¢ Although it is a reference beam interferometer it does not require path length stabilization. â€¢ It generates an analogue signal proportional to displacement above a cut-off frequency (typically 100kHz). Below this the signal is proportional to surface velocity. â€¢ It is unaffected by low frequency acoustic noise or turbulence in the beam path â€“ it is a compensated detector. The optical arrangement of the detector system is shown in figure 1. The input laser beam enters the interferometer, passing through a half-wave plate (HWP) and polarising beam splitter (PBS1) which splits the source into orthogonal, linearly polarized, reference and probe beams. Rotation of the half-wave plate alters the plane of polarization of the input beam and thus allows the relative intensities of the reference and probe beams to be adjusted.",2004,
A Bayesian Approach for Identifying Multivariate Differences Between Groups,"We present a novel approach to the problem of detecting multivariate statistical differences across groups of data. The need to compare data in a multivariate manner arises naturally in observational studies, randomized trials, comparative effectiveness research, abnormality and anomaly detection scenarios, and other application areas. In such comparisons, it is of interest to identify statistical differences across the groups being compared. The approach we present in this paper addresses this issue by constructing statistical models that describe the groups being compared and using a decomposable Bayesian Dirichlet score of the models to identify variables that behave statistically differently between the groups. In our evaluation, the new method performed significantly better than logistic lasso regression in indentifying differences in a variety of datasets under a variety of conditions.",2015,Advances in intelligent data analysis.

A sparse Bayesian approach for joint feature selection and classifier learning,"In this paper we present a new method for Joint Feature Selection and Classifier Learning using a sparse Bayesian approach. These tasks are performed by optimizing a global loss function that includes a term associated with the empirical loss and another one representing a feature selection and regularization constraint on the parameters. To minimize this function we use a recently proposed technique, the Boosted Lasso algorithm, that follows the regularization path of the empirical risk associated with our loss function. We develop the algorithm for a well known non-parametrical classification method, the relevance vector machine, and perform experiments using a synthetic data set and three databases from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The results show that our method is able to select the relevant features, increasing in some cases the classification accuracy when feature selection is performed.",2008,Pattern Analysis and Applications
Bone disease in end-stage renal failure.,"To the Editor.â€” Congratulations on the CONTEMPO '85 issue. This annual offering of a year's update on medical progress is a luxury. I write, however, to differ with Dr Glassock's conclusion, in the nephrology section, that aluminum is a primary factor in the bone complications of end-stage renal disease. The knowledge that phosphate depletion alone 2,3 may cause rickets has been with us long enough to have been forgotten. Ingestion of aluminum hydroxide causes phosphate depletion. 4 Thus, aluminum may mediate rickets (and osteomalacia) by causing phosphate depletion, rather than by poisoning the osteocyte. Reduction in bone formation caused by aluminum toxicity, as claimed by Dr Glassock, would have just the opposite result to what is known to happen when elemental phosphorus, lead, bismuth, 5 or fluorine 6 is the toxin. In these poisonings it is the osteoclastic activity of the osteocyte, not its osteoblastic activity, that is inhibited. At",1986,JAMA

A two-microRNA-based signature predicts first-line chemotherapy outcomes in advanced colorectal cancer patients,"Prognostic and predictive markers are needed to predict the clinical outcomes of patients with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) who receive standard first-line treatments. We performed a prospective cohort study in advanced CRC patients to identify a miRNA signature that could predict the benefit of receiving first-line chemotherapy for these patients. Twenty-one paired tumours and adjacent normal tissues were collected from advanced CRC patients and analysed by miRNA microarrays. Between tumour and normal tissues, 33 miRNAs were differentially expressed and was confirmed by qRT-PCR from another group of 67 patients from a prospective cohort study. A two-miRNA-based signature was obtained using the LASSO Cox regression model based on the association between the expression of each miRNA and the PFS of individual patients. Internal and external validation cohorts, including 40 and 44 patients with advanced CRC, respectively, were performed to prove the prognostic and predictive value of this signature. A signature was built based on two miRNAs, miR-125b-2-3p and miR-933. CRC patients were classified into low- and high-risk groups for disease progression based on this tool. The patients with low risk scores generally had better PFS than those with high risk scores. In the training set, the median PFS in the low- and high-risk groups were 12.00 and 7.40 months, respectively. In the internal validation set, the median PFS in the low- and high-risk groups were 9.90 and 5.10 months, respectively. In the external validation set, the median PFS in the low- and high-risk groups were 9.90 and 6.40 months, respectively. Furthermore, we detected miR-125b-2-3p associated with CRC cell sensitivity to first-line chemotherapy. Our two-miRNA-based signature was a reliable prognostic and predictive tool for tumour progression in patients with advanced CRC, and might be able to predict the benefit of receiving standard first-line chemotherapy in CRC.",2018,Cell Death Discovery
Networkâ€based feature selection reveals substructures of gene modules responding to salt stress in rice,"Rice, an important food resource, is highly sensitive to salt stress, which is directly related to food security. Although many studies have identified physiological mechanisms that confer tolerance to the osmotic effects of salinity, the link between rice genotype and salt tolerance is not very clear yet. Association of gene co-expression network and rice phenotypic data under stress has penitential to identify stress-responsive genes, but there is no standard method to associate stress phenotype with gene co-expression network. A novel method for integration of gene co-expression network and stress phenotype data was developed to conduct a system analysis to link genotype to phenotype. We applied a LASSO-based method to the gene co-expression network of rice with salt stress to discover key genes and their interactions for salt tolerance-related phenotypes. Submodules in gene modules identified from the co-expression network were selected by the LASSO regression, which establishes a linear relationship between gene expression profiles and physiological responses, that is, sodium/potassium condenses under salt stress. Genes in these submodules have functions related to ion transport, osmotic adjustment, and oxidative tolerance. We argued that these genes in submodules are biologically meaningful and useful for studies on rice salt tolerance. This method can be applied to other studies to efficiently and reliably integrate co-expression network and phenotypic data.",2019,Plant Direct
Enzymatic Reconstitution and Biosynthetic Investigation of the Lasso Peptide Fusilassin.,"Lasso peptides are a class of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified natural product which possess a unique lariat knot conformation. The low entropy ""threaded"" conformation endows lasso peptides with considerable resistance to heat and proteolytic degradation, which are attractive properties for the development of peptide-based therapeutics. Despite their discovery nearly 30 years ago, the molecular mechanism underlying lasso peptide biosynthesis remains poorly characterized due to the low stability of the purified biosynthetic enzymes. Here, we report the biosynthetic reconstitution of a lasso peptide derived from Thermobifida fusca, termed fusilassin. Beyond robust catalytic activity, the fusilassin enzymes demonstrate extraordinary substrate tolerance during heterologous expression in E. coli and upon purification in cell-free biosynthetic reconstitution reactions. We provide evidence that the fusilassin biosynthetic enzymes are not capable of forming branched-cyclic products but can produce entirely unrelated lasso peptides. Finally, we leveraged our bioinformatic survey of all lasso peptides identified in GenBank to perform coevolutionary analysis of two requisite biosynthetic proteins. This effort correctly identified residues governing an important protein-protein interaction, illustrating how genomic insight can accelerate the characterization of natural product biosynthetic pathways. The fusilassin enzymes described within represent a model system for both designing future lasso peptides of biomedical importance and also for elucidating the molecular mechanisms that govern lasso peptide biosynthesis.",2019,Journal of the American Chemical Society
Learning from MOM's principles,"We obtain estimation error rates and sharp oracle inequalities for a Birge's T-estimator using a regularized median of mean principle as based tests. The results hold with exponentially large probability -- the same one as in the gaussian framework with independent noise-- under only weak moments assumption like a $L_4/L_2$ assumption and without assuming independence between the noise and the design $X$. The obtained rates are minimax optimal. The regularization norm we used can be any norm. When it has some sparsity inducing power we recover sparse rates of convergence and sparse oracle inequalities. As in [Lecue and Mendelson, Regularization and the small ball method I: Sparse recovery], the size of the sub-differential of the regularization norm in a neighborhood of the oracle plays a central role in our analysis. 
Moreover, the procedure allows for robust estimation in the sense that a large part of the data may have nothing to do with the oracle we want to reconstruct. The number of such irrelevant data (which can be seen as outliers) may be as large as \textit{(sample size)$\times$(rate of convergence)} as long as the quantity of useful data is larger than a proportion of the number of observations. 
As a proof of concept, we obtain the ""exact"" minimax rate of convergence $s \log(ed/s)/N$ for the problem of recovery of a $s$-sparse vector in ${\mathbb R}^d$ via a median of mean version of the LASSO under a $L_{q_0}$ assumption on the noise for some $q_0>2$ and a $C_0\log(ed)$ moment assumption on the design matrix. As mentionned previously this result holds with exponentially large probability as if the noise and the design were independent and standard gaussian random variables.",2017,
High-dimensional adaptive function-on-scalar regression,"Applications of functional data with large numbers of predictors have grown precipitously in recent years, driven, in part, by rapid advances in genotyping technologies. Given the large numbers of genetic mutations encountered in genetic association studies, statistical methods which more fully exploit the underlying structure of the data are imperative for maximizing statistical power. However, there is currently very limited work in functional data with large numbers of predictors. Tools are presented for simultaneous variable selection and parameter estimation in a functional linear model with a functional outcome and a large number of scalar predictors; the technique is called AFSL for Adaptive Function-on-Scalar Lasso. It is demonstrated how techniques from convex analysis over Hilbert spaces can be used to establish a functional version of the oracle property for AFSL over any real separable Hilbert space, even when the number of predictors, I, is exponentially large compared to the sample size, N. AFSL is illustrated via a simulation study and data from the Childhood Asthma Management Program, CAMP, selecting those genetic mutations which are important for lung growth.",2016,Econometrics and Statistics
Convex Modeling of Interactions with Strong Heredity.,"We consider the task of fitting a regression model involving interactions among a potentially large set of covariates, in which we wish to enforce strong heredity. We propose FAMILY, a very general framework for this task. Our proposal is a generalization of several existing methods, such as VANISH [Radchenko and James, 2010], hierNet [Bien et al., 2013], the all-pairs lasso, and the lasso using only main effects. It can be formulated as the solution to a convex optimization problem, which we solve using an efficient alternating directions method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. This algorithm has guaranteed convergence to the global optimum, can be easily specialized to any convex penalty function of interest, and allows for a straightforward extension to the setting of generalized linear models. We derive an unbiased estimator of the degrees of freedom of FAMILY, and explore its performance in a simulation study and on an HIV sequence data set.",2016,"Journal of computational and graphical statistics : a joint publication of American Statistical Association, Institute of Mathematical Statistics, Interface Foundation of North America"
P. Heidelberg 182:frammenti di commedia e di lessico politico ateniese,"P. Heidelberg 182: frammenti di commedia e di lessico politico ateniese aims at discussing new points concerning a text about which the critical debate seemed fixed in two opposed factions, both dating back to the middle of the Fifties: on the one hand Siegmann, the editor princeps, who had recognized in the papyrus trochaic tetrameters to be ascribed to one of the political sections so common in Attic old comedy; on the other hand Gigante, who had read the surviving lines as fragments of a prose-pamphlet critical of Athenian democracy. Â Set against this background, the systematic metrical and paleographic re-examination of the surviving text has allowed us to elicit further clues favouring its actual scansion in trochaic tetrameters. Building on these grounds, we could further elaborate some suggestive similarities between the Heidelberg lines and the corpus of Attic old comedy: not only do similar strings of words occurr, but the same political issues also emerge, between governement of the polis and thalassocracy.Â Â  P. Heidelberg 182: frammenti di commedia e di lessico politico ateniese intende presentare nuovi spunti di riflessione su un testo attorno a cui il dibattito critico sembrava cristallizzato in due opinioni contrapposte, entrambe espresse alla meta degli anni Cinquanta: da un lato Siegmann, editor princeps, che aveva ravvisato nel papiro tetrametri trocaici riconducibili alle sortite a sfondo politico cosi frequenti nella commedia attica antica; dall'altro Gigante, che aveva interpretato invece i resti superstiti come frammenti di un opuscolo in prosa critico nei confronti della democrazia ateniese. In questo quadro, il sistematico riesame metrico e paleografico del testo ci ha permesso di presentare indizi ulteriori che suggeriscono una sua effettiva scansione in tetrametri trocaici. Sulla base cosi ricostruita, ci e stato possibile indicare alcune suggestive assonanze fra i righi in questione e il corpus della commedia attica antica: non solo ritornano vocaboli e nessi simili; sembrano emergere anche i medesimi nodi politici, fra gestione del potere e talassocrazia.",2011,Historika : Studi di Storia Greca e Romana
Identifying Latent Structures in Panel Data,"This paper provides a novel mechanism for identifying and estimating latent group structures in panel data using penalized regression techniques. We focus on linear models where the slope parameters are heterogeneous across groups but homogenous within a group and the group membership is unknown. Two approaches are considered -- penalized least squares (PLS) for models without endogenous regressors, and penalized GMM (PGMM) for models with endogeneity. In both cases we develop a new variant of Lasso called classifier-Lasso (C-Lasso) that serves to shrink individual coefficients to the unknown group-specific coefficients. C-Lasso achieves simultaneous classification and consistent estimation in a single step and the classification exhibits the desirable property of uniform consistency. For PLS estimation C-Lasso also achieves the oracle property so that group-specific parameter estimators are asymptotically equivalent to infeasible estimators that use individual group identity information. For PGMM estimation the oracle property of C-Lasso is preserved in some special cases. Simulations demonstrate good finite-sample performance of the approach both in classification and estimation. An empirical application investigating the determinants of cross-country savings rates finds two latent groups among 56 countries, providing empirical confirmation that higher savings rates go in hand with higher income growth.",2016,Econometrica
Roles of specific Plasmodium falciparum mutations in resistance to amodiaquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine in Burkina Faso.,"We evaluated associations between key polymorphisms in target genes and responses to treatment with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) or amodiaquine (AQ) for uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso. Presence of the dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) 108N or 59R mutations (but not dhfr 51I or dihydropteroate synthetase [dhps] 437G) and P. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt) 76T or P. falciparum multidrug resistance 1 (pfmdr1) 86Y or 1246Y mutations (but not pfmdr1 184F) predicted recrudescence after treatment with SP and AQ, respectively. Treatment led to significant increases in the prevalence of the same mutations (except 1246Y) in new infections that presented after therapy. The dhfr 164L and dhps 540E mutations were not seen in any isolates. These results clarify the key roles of a small number of mutations in P. falciparum resistance to SP and AQ in west Africa.",2006,The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene
Barma bridewealth: socialization and the reproduction of labour in a domestic African economy,"Interest in marriage preliminaries was raised in the late 1920s by missionaries and administrators who insisted that women were chattels in societies with bridewealth: 'a girl ... is knocked down to the highest bidder in the marriage market' (Driberg, 1929: 180). Anthropologists challenged this view in two ways. Structural-functional interpretations, which have dominated the literature, argue that while marriage prestations may operate as payments, they have more 'important social functions' (Evans-Pritchard, 1931: 38), including the creation of jural statuses and the structuring of unilineal descent group relations. 2 Accordingly, Evans-Pritchard proposed that transfers of marriage prestations be termed bridewealth to express the fact that they largely performed non-payment functions. Economic views re-emerged following articles by Gray and Goody which respectively argued that 'wives' were acquired 'like other commodities' (Gray, 1960: 56) and that bridewealth payments operated as parts of circulating credit funds (Goody, 1973: 30). Symbolic and economic views dominate contemporary understanding of bridewealth. Comaroff has edited a volume (1980) whose contributions explore the relationship between the meaning of bridewealth and the structural features of the societies in which it is found. Papp (1983) has developed a price theory model of marriage prestations. Meillassoux has originated a Marxist position, which maintains that bridewealth functions 'to reproduce the relations of production' in domestic economies, at least partially by providing elders with a means of controlling their juniors (1981: 67).3 Each of the different interpretations has yielded valuable insights. This paper's purpose is not to criticize existing approaches but to suggest a novel one. Bridewealth is transmitted in a process which involves the giving of prestations. Usually this occurs as part of a ceremonial cycle that makes certain activities incumbent on individual participants. Termination of the cycle in marriage is often, but not invariably, contingent upon at least partial disbursement of bridewealth. But first the bridewealth has to be accumulated. This essay shows how the accumulation ofbridewealth among the Barma of Chad can help socialize young men into their adult economic roles. This socialization is accomplished in two ways. Firstly, the need of young men to amass bridewealth causes their marriage to be postponed, thus creating a time when socialization may occur. Secondly, a state of sexual and social deprivation is created for the young men which can be terminated only by marriage. Now marriage has to be preceded by a sequence of courtship transactions, which operates",1984,Africa
A Framework For Hydroclimate Prediction and Discovery Using Object-Oriented Data,"Author(s): Sellars, Scott | Advisor(s): Sorooshian, Soroosh; Gao, Xiaogang | Abstract: This thesis introduces a new object-oriented precipitation data set and explores statistical methods that can be used for predicting monthly precipitation and discovering the impact of climate variability on precipitation. The object-oriented data set consists of segmented, near global, satellite precipitation data characterized into four-dimensional (4D) objects (longitude, latitude, time and intensity). We use the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN) .25-degree dataset, which covers from 60N to 60S and from March 1st, 2000 to January 1st, 2011 as our source data. This data set is the called PERSIANN-CONNected objECT (CONNECT) and is stored in a PostgreSQL database. Using this novel data set we propose a prediction and discovery framework that 1) empirically studies the monthly precipitation systems, 2) builds accurate prediction models, and 3) estimates the relevance of the features included in a data matrix of attributes. We use four machine learning models, 1) Lasso, 2) Elastic Net, 3) Gradient Boosting Trees, and 4) Extremely Random Trees, combined with model validation, using a leave one out (LOO) prediction strategy and confidence estimation using bootstrap resampling that is applied to a precipitation prediction problem. Our case study focuses on a subset population of 626 Western U.S. precipitation systems. The study shows the joint interactions of the selected climate phenomena: 1) Arctic Oscillation (AO), 2) El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and 3) Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO) on these 626 precipitation systems by analyzing the increased/decreased likelihood of having precipitation systems occurring over the Western U.S. In addition, this dissertation finds that the machine learning methods produce accurate monthly precipitation frequency predictions, comparable to climatology at different monthly lead times and identify relevant features that correspond to interacting modes of climate, such as the Western Hemisphere Warm Pool (WHWP), Atlantic Meridional Mode Sea Surface Temperatures (AMMSST), North Pacific Index (NP) and the South West Monsoon Index (SWMONSOON) leading to alternate physical explanations of Western U.S. precipitation variability. Given the importance of monthly prediction in water resource planning and management, this framework provides an approach to understanding Western U.S. precipitation, and even more importantly, an approach that can be applicable to study precipitation around the world.",2014,
Accuracy of Genomic Selection Methods in a Standard Data Set of Loblolly Pine (Pinus taeda L.),"Genomic selection can increase genetic gain per generation through early selection. Genomic selection is expected to be particularly valuable for traits that are costly to phenotype and expressed late in the life cycle of long-lived species. Alternative approaches to genomic selection prediction models may perform differently for traits with distinct genetic properties. Here the performance of four different original methods of genomic selection that differ with respect to assumptions regarding distribution of marker effects, including (i) ridge regression-best linear unbiased prediction (RR-BLUP), (ii) Bayes A, (iii) Bayes CÏ€, and (iv) Bayesian LASSO are presented. In addition, a modified RR-BLUP (RR-BLUP B) that utilizes a selected subset of markers was evaluated. The accuracy of these methods was compared across 17 traits with distinct heritabilities and genetic architectures, including growth, development, and disease-resistance properties, measured in a Pinus taeda (loblolly pine) training population of 951 individuals genotyped with 4853 SNPs. The predictive ability of the methods was evaluated using a 10-fold, cross-validation approach, and differed only marginally for most method/trait combinations. Interestingly, for fusiform rust disease-resistance traits, Bayes CÏ€, Bayes A, and RR-BLUB B had higher predictive ability than RR-BLUP and Bayesian LASSO. Fusiform rust is controlled by few genes of large effect. A limitation of RR-BLUP is the assumption of equal contribution of all markers to the observed variation. However, RR-BLUP B performed equally well as the Bayesian approaches.The genotypic and phenotypic data used in this study are publically available for comparative analysis of genomic selection prediction models.",2012,Genetics
LAD variable selection for linear models with randomly censored data,"The least absolute deviations (LAD) variable selection for linear models with randomly censored data is studied through the Lasso.

Incorporating prior biological knowledge for network-based differential gene expression analysis using differentially weighted graphical LASSO,"BackgroundConventional differential gene expression analysis by methods such as studentâ€™s t-test, SAM, and Empirical Bayes often searches for statistically significant genes without considering the interactions among them. Network-based approaches provide a natural way to study these interactions and to investigate the rewiring interactions in disease versus control groups. In this paper, we apply weighted graphical LASSO (wgLASSO) algorithm to integrate a data-driven network model with prior biological knowledge (i.e., protein-protein interactions) for biological network inference. We propose a novel differentially weighted graphical LASSO (dwgLASSO) algorithm that builds group-specific networks and perform network-based differential gene expression analysis to select biomarker candidates by considering their topological differences between the groups.ResultsThrough simulation, we showed that wgLASSO can achieve better performance in building biologically relevant networks than purely data-driven models (e.g., neighbor selection, graphical LASSO), even when only a moderate level of information is available as prior biological knowledge. We evaluated the performance of dwgLASSO for survival time prediction using two microarray breast cancer datasets previously reported by Bild et al. and van de Vijver et al. Compared with the top 10 significant genes selected by conventional differential gene expression analysis method, the top 10 significant genes selected by dwgLASSO in the dataset from Bild et al. led to a significantly improved survival time prediction in the independent dataset from van de Vijver et al. Among the 10 genes selected by dwgLASSO, UBE2S, SALL2, XBP1 and KIAA0922 have been confirmed by literature survey to be highly relevant in breast cancer biomarker discovery study. Additionally, we tested dwgLASSO on TCGA RNA-seq data acquired from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) on tumors samples and their corresponding non-tumorous liver tissues. Improved sensitivity, specificity and area under curve (AUC) were observed when comparing dwgLASSO with conventional differential gene expression analysis method.ConclusionsThe proposed network-based differential gene expression analysis algorithm dwgLASSO can achieve better performance than conventional differential gene expression analysis methods by integrating information at both gene expression and network topology levels. The incorporation of prior biological knowledge can lead to the identification of biologically meaningful genes in cancer biomarker studies.",2017,BMC Bioinformatics
Topology: a unique dimension in protein engineering,"Controlling protein topology has been a long standing challenge to go beyond their linear configuration defined by the translation mechanism of cellular machinery. In this mini-review, we focus on the topological diversity in proteins and review the major categories of protein topologies known to date, including branched/star proteins, circular proteins, lasso proteins, knotted proteins, and protein catenanes. The discovery of these topologically complex natural proteins and their synthetic pathways, the rational design and recombinant synthesis of artificial topological proteins and their biophysical studies, are summarized and discussed with regard to their general features and broad implications. The complexity of protein topology is recognized and the routes to diverse protein topologies are illustrated. We believe that topology engineering is an important way to modify protein properties without alternating their native sequences and shall bring in valuable dynamic features central to the creation of artificial protein machinery.",2017,Science China Chemistry
The integration of environmental impact assessment and environmental management systems: experiences from the UK,"Environmental impact assessments (EIA) and environmental management systems (EMS) enable organisations to identify, assess and manage environmental impacts throughout a development's lifecycle, improving overall environmental performance. To ensure these tools are used efficiently and effectively, their synergies and links ought to be recognised and exploited, although the extent to which this occurs in practice is uncertain. Focusing on the UK, this paper reviews experience of linking the tools and presents four case studies demonstrating different aspects of integration. Further efforts are needed to seek and share good practice in order to improve prospects for integration. These efforts should prioritise sectors where EIA development regularly occurs, EMS is well established and a single organisation commonly has involvement across project phases. Introducing EIA and EMS EIA and EMS are environmental protection tools with complementary purposes. While the goal of EIA is to anticipate and mitigate the environmental impacts of proposed new projects at the planning and design stages, an EMS can help organisations to effectively manage the day-to-day environmental impacts arising during the construction, operation and decommissioning of such projects. Organisations can have their EMS certified to standards such as ISO 14001 (ISO, 2004). By supporting a systematic approach to the identification and evaluation of impacts, both tools can ensure that resources are focused on those impacts deemed to be â€œsignificantâ€, identifying them at an early stage in project planning and systematically addressing them throughout the project lifecycle. The strengthening of links between EIA and the ongoing environmental management of a project has been recommended as a specific way in which UK EIA practice could be made more effective (Jay, Jones, Slinn & Wood, 2007). A comparison of the two tools demonstrates their rather different origins and regulatory status within the European Union, including the UK, although their goals are similar. While ISO 14001 is designed to be adopted voluntarily by organisations operating in any sector, EIA is restricted to projects listed on the annexes of the EIA Directive for which it is legally required. EMS activity could be considered more widespread, with nearly 10,000 ISO 14001 certificates held in the UK (ISO, 2009) against 450 EIAs carried out in England each year (Barker, 2006). The integration of EIA and EMS Various theoretical approaches to linking EIA and EMS have been proposed (eg Perdicoulis & Durning, 2007; Ridgeway 2005; Sanchez & Hacking 2002;) and a small number of studies has investigated environmental management links to EIA in real-life projects (eg Barnes & Lemon, 1999; Marshall, 2004; Slinn, Handley and Jay, 2007;). At a basic level, these two tools could be linked if an EIA recommended that an EMS be implemented during project construction or operation and this commitment was fulfilled by the site developer or operator(s). However, this link would be strengthened further if the EIA findings directly informed the EMS. For example, Sanchez and Hacking (2002) suggest that the criteria defined and used during EIA should be later used in planning the EMS for the relevant project. EIA findings might contribute to the register of aspects and impacts or inform a risk-based internal audit programme. The EIA provides an essential source of baseline information against which â€œcontinual environmental improvementâ€ (a key requirement of the ISO 14001 standard) can be demonstrated year-on-year. Likewise, EMS for an existing site can generate environmental information that could be useful when carrying out EIA for a similar new site (Glasson et al., 2005. This approach gives the organisation the opportunity to translate generic recommendations into implementable procedures or instructions and helps address stakeholder concerns (Sanchez & Hacking, 2002). However, the extent to which these linkages are recognised or exploited more generally across different sectors and locations seems to be relatively unknown, including in the UK. Furthermore, Ecclestone & Smythe (2002) claim that comparatively little consideration has been given by",2010,
A Modified Least Angle Regression Algorithm for Hierarchical Interaction,"Variable selection is important in high dimensional regression. Traditional variable selection methods such as stepwise selection are unstable which means that the set of the selected variables is sensitive according to the change of data sets. As an alternative to those methods, a series of sparse penalized methods are used for estimation and variable selection simultaneously. The full set of LASSO solutions can be calculated by a minor modification of the LARS algorithm. In many important practical problems, the main effect alone may not be enough to capture the relationship between the response and predictors, and high-order interactions are often of interest to scientific researchers. In considering two-way interaction models with a large number of covariates, we often would like to determine a smaller subset that exhibits strong effects on the response variable have been suggested. Considering all possible interactions, however, is almost impossible due to computational burden when the number of covariate is large. To resolve this problem, the heredity structure between the main and interaction effect can be considered, algorithms for LASSO with heredity structure. However these algorithms cannot be executed if the number of main effects",2008,
Lasso Regressions and Forecasting Models in Applied Stress Testing,"Model selection and forecasting in stress tests can be facilitated using machine learning techniques. These techniques have proved robust in other fields for dealing with the curse of dimensionality, a situation often encountered in applied stress testing. Lasso regressions, in particular, are well suited for building forecasting models when the number of potential covariates is large, and the number of observations is small or roughly equal to the number of covariates. This paper presents a conceptual overview of lasso regressions, explains how they fit in applied stress tests, describes its advantages over other model selection methods, and illustrates their application by constructing forecasting models of sectoral probabilities of default in an advanced emerging market economy.",2017,IMF Working Papers
"The influence of availability, affect and empirical evidence on individual differences in children's understanding of pretence.","This research focused on the issue of children's understanding of the pretend-reality distinction. In particular, it investigated several features of the availability hypothesis (Harris, Brown, Marriott, Whittall & Harmer, 1991; Johnson & Harris, 1994) and the pretence continuation account (Golomb & Galasso, 1995) which have been previously offered as competing explanations for children's behaviours during pretence. Specifically, the experiments reported here explored the role of differing forms of affect in both of these accounts and assessed the constraining influence of empirical evidence of reality on the effects of increased cognitive availability. To this end, a series of seven related experiments were conducted in which four to seven year old children (N = 591) were asked to pretend about the contents of empty boxes. The children's behaviours on a series of box selection tasks were then observed under conditions of differing affect and varying levels of empirical evidence (experiments 1 to 5). The children's spontaneous behaviours were also video recorded (experiments 6 and 7). Taken together, the results suggest that there are interactions between individual differences, age, affect and levels of empirical evidence which predict children's propensity towards making pretend-reality confusions. In relation to previous explanations of children's behaviour, the pretence continuation account (Golomb & Galasso, 1995) is unable to explain the complexity of the current findings and the results are instead more consistent with an account involving individual differences such as that proposed by Johnson and Harris (1994). However, there are two crucial contributions which the experiments reported here can make to these explanations. First, there are developmental changes which take place between four and seven years of age in relation to pretend-reality understanding and these changes interact with the individual differences identified by Johnson and Harris (1994). Second, the present data provide evidence of the central role played by affect in children's pretence. Overall, this thesis offers an account of children's understanding of the distinction between pretence and reality which incorporates both developmental and individual differences.",1998,
Endoscopic management of internally migrated pancreatic duct stents (with video),"Background and AimsSpontaneous intestinal migration of pancreatic stents is a known phenomenon. However, retrieval of a proximally migrated pancreatic stent (PMPS) poses a therapeutic challenge. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate technical success of endoscopic retrograde of cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for extraction ofÂ PMPS, including number of sessions, need ofÂ surgery for failures and intervention-induced adverse events. The secondary outcome was to evaluate long-term effects of PMPS on the ductal morphology.MethodsData of patients undergoing pancreatic stenting since January 2007 was reviewed. Fourteen patients were found to have PMPS. The level of stent migration was divided into two categories: level 1: retropapillary migration of the stent, the distal end seen till the genu (nâ€‰=â€‰6). Level II: PMPS with distal end seen beyond genu (nâ€‰=â€‰8). The stents were placed due to following reasons, prophylactic pancreatic stenting after common bile duct stone extraction (nâ€‰=â€‰6), pancreatic endotherapy for chronic pancreatitis (nâ€‰=â€‰7), and recurrent acute pancreatitis with incomplete pancreas divisum (nâ€‰=â€‰1). ERCP was done using Olympus TJF 160/180 duodenoscope. Stent extraction was initially attempted using rat tooth forceps, snare with or without wire, wire-guided basket, and in case of failures, pancreatoscope was used (Boston Scientific, USA).ResultsPMPS could successfully be retrieved in 13 out of 14 patients (92.8Â %). Stents were retrieved using stone extraction balloon in two (14.2Â %), modified angiography balloon in one (7Â %), rat tooth in three patients (21.4Â %), over-the-wire snare in three patients (21.4Â %), lasso technique in one (7Â %), and under pancreatoscope guidance in three patients (21.4Â %). Adverse events encountered were mild pancreatitis (nâ€‰=â€‰2, 14Â %) and self-limited bleeding (nâ€‰=â€‰2, 14Â %).ConclusionsEndotherapy of PMPS could be complex and associated with adverse events.

Lasso-type Gmm Estimator,"This paper proposes the least absolute shrinkage and selection operatorâ€“type (Lasso-type) generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator. This Lasso-type estimator is formed by the GMM objective function with the addition of a penalty term. The exponent of the penalty term in the regular Lasso estimator is equal to one. However, the exponent of the penalty term in the Lasso-type estimator is less than one in the analysis here. The magnitude of the exponent is reduced to avoid the asymptotic bias. This estimator selects the correct model and estimates it simultaneously. In other words, this method estimates the redundant parameters as zero in the large samples and provides the standard GMM limit distribution for the estimates of the nonzero parameters in the model. The asymptotic theory for our estimator is nonstandard. We conduct a simulation study that shows that the Lasso-type GMM correctly selects the true model much more often than the Bayesian information Criterion (BIC) and another model selection procedure based on the GMM objective function.",2009,Econometric Theory
Reconstructing Dna Copy Number by Penalized Estimation and Imputation.,"Recent advances in genomics have underscored the surprising ubiquity of DNA copy number variation (CNV). Fortunately, modern genotyping platforms also detect CNVs with fairly high reliability. Hidden Markov models and algorithms have played a dominant role in the interpretation of CNV data. Here we explore CNV reconstruction via estimation with a fused-lasso penalty as suggested by Tibshirani and Wang [Biostatistics 9 (2008) 18-29]. We mount a fresh attack on this difficult optimization problem by the following: (a) changing the penalty terms slightly by substituting a smooth approximation to the absolute value function, (b) designing and implementing a new MM (majorization-minimization) algorithm, and (c) applying a fast version of Newton's method to jointly update all model parameters. Together these changes enable us to minimize the fused-lasso criterion in a highly effective way.We also reframe the reconstruction problem in terms of imputation via discrete optimization. This approach is easier and more accurate than parameter estimation because it relies on the fact that only a handful of possible copy number states exist at each SNP. The dynamic programming framework has the added bonus of exploiting information that the current fused-lasso approach ignores. The accuracy of our imputations is comparable to that of hidden Markov models at a substantially lower computational cost.",2010,The annals of applied statistics
Oligoquetas marinhos : novos registros globais com Ãªnfase no AtlÃ¢ntico Sul,"The oligochaetes â€œstrictu sensuâ€ (i.e. Clitellata, exept Hirudinea, Branchiobdellida e Acanthobdellida) are found in a large variety of environments, from coastal regions such as estuaries and mangroves to extreme habitats such as glaciers and hadal trenches. Historically, oligochaetes have been divided into two groups, â€œMicrodriliâ€, the smaller worms generally associated with the aquatic environment, and â€œMegadriliâ€, the larger forms most of which are found in terrestrial habitats. Approximately 600 of 1700 known aquatic species are marine. The marine forms are generally small, ranging from less than 1 millimeter to a few centimeters long. Among the marine taxa, the most abundant belong to the controversial family Tubificidae / Naididae, with about 450 species Other groups with marine representatives are Enchytraeidae, Capilloventridae, and Randiellidae. Marine oligochaetes are numerically important in marine benthic assemblages, and play an important role in the secondary productivity, remineralizing nutrients and making them available again to the primary producers. However, due their morphological similarity, they are rarely identified to species, genus or even to family level, and frequentely reported as ""Oligochaeta"" in most ecological studies. Some species such as Tubificoides benedii are known for the high tolerance to pollution by organic enrichment.The marine oligochaetes are able to reproduce sexually and asexually. The life cycle of these organisms is also poorly known, and the lack of studies is mainly due to: (1) absence of discrete age classes; (2) Neither body size nor number of segments are precise features of maturity stage; (3) the time consumed in the analysis of the stage of maturity of each specimen under a microscope; (4) the cocoons of different species are not identifiable by morphological features. The diversity of marine oligochaetes is well known in the northern hemisphere. However, the taxonomic knowledge of marine oligochaetes in the South Atlantic is clearly unsatisfactory. Although some sporadic studies between the 50â€™s and 80â€™s in the last century, the group remains ignored by the local scientific community. In this context, this thesis provides important advances in the knowledge of the group in the South Atlantic, summarizing current knowledge of this fauna through an updated literature review and five chapters written in the form of scientific articles.The first article is a critical overview of the current knowledge of marine oligochaetes in Brazil. In this article, the geographical distribution of the naidid (sensu ErsÃ©us et al., 2008) Tectidrilus c.f. gabriellae, originally described for Ilha Bela, SÃ£o Paulo and also known for some regions of the Caribbean is extended to Bay of ParanaguÃ¡, ParanÃ¡. The second article presents the first record of an achaeta species (species that devoid of chaetae) of the geneus Marionina to South America. This species is very similar to Marionina nevisensis described for Nevis Island in the Caribbean however, preliminary molecular analysis suggests it is a new species. In the third article, we provide a new phylogenetic hypothesis and also the description of nine new species of another Enchytraeidae genus, Grania. Seven of these species Grania brasiliensis sp. nov. from Brazil; Grania bekkouchei sp. nov.; Grania cryptica sp. nov.; Grania capensis sp. nov.; Grania simonae sp. nov., from South Africa, Grania hinojosai sp. nov. and Grania chilensis sp. nov., from Chile are the first report for for this genus in both, Africa and South America, and two, Grania unitheca sp. nov., and Grania carolinensis sp. nov., new records for North America. The fourth article provides the first list of Grania species, including historical and recent data of all valid species described to date, their respective synonyms, and information about their geographical distribution. A total of 80 species were recorded described in all five continents, covering the ocean basins and Antarctic region. In the fifth article, the monophyly of 80 species of the South Atlantic including Antarctica was statistically tested by combining four statistical methods. We could identify 32 potential species belonging to two families of marine oligochaetes. In this article, the species Doliodrilus fibrisaccus, Limnodriloides pierantonii, L. rubicundus, L. sacculus, Paranais Frici, Stephensoniella sterreri, and Thalassodrilides gurwitschi are recorded for the first time from the eastern coast of South America (Brazil). This study also confirms the usefulness of molecular approaches to identify marine oligochaetes which are hardly identifiable through morphology only.",2016,
Model selection and structure specification in ultra-high dimensional generalised semi-varying coefficient models,"In this paper, we study the model selection and structure specification for the generalised semi-varying coefficient models (GSVCMs), where the number of potential covariates is allowed to be larger than the sample size.We first propose a penalised likelihood method with the LASSO penalty function to obtain the preliminary estimates of the functional coefficients. Then, using the quadratic approximation for the local log-likelihood function and the adaptive group LASSO penalty (or the local linear approximation of the group SCAD penalty) with the help of the preliminary estimation of the functional coefficients, we introduce a novel penalised weighted least squares procedure to select the significant covariates and identify the constant coefficients among the coefficients of the selected covariates, which could thus specify the semiparametric modelling structure. The developed model selection and structure specification approach not only inherits many nice statistical properties from the local maximum likelihood estimation and nonconcave penalised likelihood method, but also computationally attractive thanks to the computational algorithm that is proposed to implement our method. Under some mild conditions, we establish the asymptotic properties for the proposed model selection and estimation procedure such as the sparsity and oracle property.We also conduct simulation studies to examine the finite sample performance of the proposed method, and finally apply the method to analyse a real data set, which leads to some interesting findings.",2015,Annals of Statistics
Modified Frank-Wolfe Algorithm for Enhanced Sparsity in Support Vector Machine Classifiers,"This work proposes a new algorithm for training a re-weighted L2 Support Vector Machine (SVM), inspired on the re-weighted Lasso algorithm of Cand\`es et al. and on the equivalence between Lasso and SVM shown recently by Jaggi. In particular, the margin required for each training vector is set independently, defining a new weighted SVM model. These weights are selected to be binary, and they are automatically adapted during the training of the model, resulting in a variation of the Frank-Wolfe optimization algorithm with essentially the same computational complexity as the original algorithm. 
As shown experimentally, this algorithm is computationally cheaper to apply since it requires less iterations to converge, and it produces models with a sparser representation in terms of support vectors and which are more stable with respect to the selection of the regularization hyper-parameter.",2018,ArXiv
Advanced optical microstructures embedded in transparent encapsulation glass for photovoltaics (Conference Presentation),"Liquid glass, a photo-curable amorphous silica nanocomposite, recently demonstrated groundbreaking capabilities as a transparent fused silica glass that can be structured in arbitrary geometries [1,2]. The ability to process high-quality glass like a polymer, including the use of 3D printing techniques, opens up new routes to integrate optical microstructures for improved light harvesting in solar module architectures [3]. 
Optical microstructures increase the power conversion efficiency of solar modules by improved light in-coupling or by guiding light into the active area of solar modules. We investigate freeform surface cloaks that effectively increase the active area of solar modules [4] and micro-cones that reduce front side reflection and trap light in solar modules [5]. The first prototypes of encapsulated freeform surface cloaks have demonstrated a significant increase in generated current density of around 6% relative [6]. Yet, embedding of freeform surface cloaks into the architecture of conventional solar modules relies on encapsulation with various polymer layers and a glass cover by plasma bonding. In this contribution, we will present the direct integration of optical microstructures, represented by the above outlined concepts, into transparent fused silica glass covers. This approach provides both a higher optical quality of the module encapsulation and an improved compatibility of optical microstructures with the fabrication process of common solar modules. 
In summary, we demonstrate a new route for integrating optical microstructures into the architecture of solar modules by the example of embedded freeform surface cloaks and micro-cones. This highlights the great opportunities 3D shaping of liquid glass brings to the world of photovoltaics.

Lebensmittelsicherheit und -hygiene im Privathaushalt:,"Das primare Ziel dieser Masterarbeit war es, das Verhalten der Studienteilnehmer wahrend kritischer Phasen der Zubereitung eines Huhnerstreifengerichts mit Bratkartoffeln und eines gemischten Salates zu beobachten. Dazu wurden 40 Probanden aus Wien und Wien-Umgebung zwischen Juli und Oktober 2011 rekrutiert. Hauptaugenmerk lag auf moglichen Kreuzkontaminationen von pathogenen Bakterien, im Speziellen von thermophilen Campylobacterspezies, beispielsweise durch kontaminierte Hande, Arbeitsoberflachen oder Kuchenutensilien (Messer, Schneidbrett) vom rohen Huhn auf den verzehrsfertigen Salat. Neben einer direkten Beobachtung des Kochvorgangs zur Ermittlung des Verhaltens der Studienteilnehmer wurden auch mikrobiologische Analysen (qualitative und quantitative Campylobacterbestimmungen des rohen Huhns vor dem Kochvorgang und eines gemischten Salates nach dem Kochvorgang, sowie Proben verschiedener Oberflachen in den Kuchen der Probanden zur qualitativen Untersuchung auf Listerien) und eine Fragebogenerhebung zur Evaluierung relevanter Fragen bezuglich Einkauf/Transport, Lagerung, Kuchenhygiene/Handhabung und mikrobiologischer Kenntnisse, durchgefuhrt. Zudem wurden die Kuhlschranktemperaturen in den 40 Privathaushalten gemessen.

"Functional Morphology and Species Characteristics of a Large, Solitary Radiolarian Physematium Muelleri","Physematium spp. and related genera of radiolaria (e.g., Thalassolampe and Actissa) are characterized by a large, limpid spherical cell body varying in cytoplasmic compactness, but characteristically possessing numerous small (ca. 3 Âµm dia.) symbionts held in fine radiating axopodia surrounding the large central capsulum. An analysis of the cytoplasmic organization of Physematium muelleri suggests that this organism has adapted to a pelagic existence by increasing surface area to enhance prey capture while conserving biomass through the development of a large internally alveolate, spheroidal cell possessing fluid-filled spaces. The thin capsular wall is supported by a network of cytoplasmic strands emanating from the perinuclear region of the intracapsulum. The fine structural organization of the cytoplasm, composition and thickness of the central capsular wall, and the amount and kind of material deposited within the perinuclear envelope appear to be more significant taxonomic discriminating characterist...",1986,The Biological Bulletin
Curating as Ethics,"Today, everyone is a curator. What was once considered a hallowed expertise is now a commonplace activity of global proportions. Can this new world-wide activity be ethical and if yes, how? This book attempts to demonstrate that curating can be more than just selecting, organising and presenting information in galleries or online, it can also constitute an ethics. This ethics consists in acquiring, arranging, and distributing an always conjectural knowledge about the world, which over time, becomes a practical intelligence akin to that used by the midwife. With such an approach, this book attempts to move beyond the narrow field of museum and exhibition studies in order to provide an ethics for anyone interested in this highly visible activity, including those using a sharing digital social media platform as a curatorial endeavour. Curating as Ethics is primarily philosophical in scope, evading normative approaches to ethics (the use, non-use, abuse, and disuse of norms, principles, maxims, codes, etc.) in favour of an intuitive ethics (a midwifery) that operates at the threshold of thought and action. It explores the work of authors as diverse as Heidegger, Spinoza, Meillassoux, Mudimbe, Chalier, and Kofman. This invigorating new approach to curatorial studies aims to show how philosophy and curating can work together to articulate the world today. As such, its originality consists in forging a radically new departure to academic theses on curating that conventionally focus on exhibition making and its histories. It also manages to foster a new type of ethics on the basis of a new reading of one of Heideggerâ€™s last concept, the fourfold. From what many would consider the end of ethics, comes this book that opens up the possibility of thinking an ethics from an Heideggerian perspective. This book is published in a new series at the University of Minnesota Press called Thinking Theory edited by the well-known US scholar Grant Farred.",2020,
Functional education of monocytes during infection,"Tissue-infiltrating Ly6Chi monocytes play important protective roles during infection, including inflammatory cytokine secretion and pathogen killing. Here we show that during acute gastrointestinal infection with the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii, recruited monocytes not only contributed to parasite control, but also regulated pathologic immune responses to commensal microbes via secretion of the lipid mediator prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Priming of monocytes for regulatory function preceded systemic inflammation and was initiated prior to bone marrow egress. Natural killer (NK) cell-derived IFN-Î³ promoted a regulatory program in monocyte progenitors during development. Early bone marrow NK cell activation was controlled by systemic IL-12 produced by Batf3-dependent dendritic cells (DC) in the mucosalassociated lymphoid tissue (MALT). This work challenges the paradigm that monocyte function is dominantly imposed by local signals following tissue recruitment, and instead proposes a sequential model of differentiation in which monocytes are pre-emptively educated during development in the bone marrow to promote their tissue-specific function.

M-estimation for robust sparse unmixing of hyperspectral images,"Hyperspectral unmixing methods often use a conventional least squares based lasso which assumes that the data follows the Gaussian distribution. The normality assumption is an approximation which is generally invalid for real imagery data. We consider a robust (non-Gaussian) approach to sparse spectral unmixing of remotely sensed imagery which reduces the sensitivity of the estimator to outliers and relaxes the linearity assumption. The method consists of several appropriate penalties. We propose to use an â„“p norm with 0 < p < 1 in the sparse regression problem, which induces more sparsity in the results, but makes the problem non-convex. On the other hand, the problem, though non-convex, can be solved quite straightforwardly with an extensible algorithm based on iteratively reweighted least squares. To deal with the huge size of modern spectral libraries we introduce a library reduction step, similar to the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) array processing algorithm, which not only speeds up unmixing but also yields superior results. In the hyperspectral setting we extend the traditional least squares method to the robust heavy-tailed case and propose a generalised M-lasso solution. M-estimation replaces the Gaussian likelihood with a fixed function Ï(e) that restrains outliers. The M-estimate function reduces the effect of errors with large amplitudes or even assigns the outliers zero weights. Our experimental results on real hyperspectral data show that noise with large amplitudes (outliers) often exists in the data. This ability to mitigate the influence of such outliers can therefore offer greater robustness. Qualitative hyperspectral unmixing results on real hyperspectral image data corroborate the efficacy of the proposed method.",2016,

Le regard des humoristes montrÃ©alais immigrants sur leur pratique artistique et leur environnement social,"Cette recherche a pour objectif de decouvrir et de comprendre la situation des humoristes immigrants a Montreal. Nous avons pour intention de mieux apprehender les enjeux qui concernent ces artistes, a travers leur discours. Pour se faire, nous nous basons en premier lieu sur une revue de litterature qui nous permet de dresser la situation des artistes immigrants a Montreal, en developpant differents concepts tels que les processus d'integration au sein d'une societe, le modele de l'interculturalisme quebecois, la quete identitaire de la province ainsi que la place et le fonctionnement de l'humour au Quebec. Dans un second temps, nous revenons sur les resultats d'entrevues menees avec cinq humoristes immigrants : Adib Alkhalidey, Nabila Ben Youssef, Bruno Ly, Mehdi Bousaidan et Roman Frayssinet. Nous procedons a une approche comprehensive afin de discerner le role et la place de leur pratique artistique et la teneur de leur integration dans la societe quebecoise, de leur propre point de vue. Nous classons les resultats selon trois categories qui s'imbriquent : l'humoriste et son identite, l'humoriste et son processus de creation et l'humoriste et son environnement social. Les resultats de la recherche montrent que les humoristes se placent au centre de leur univers comique. Le fait d'etre immigrant semble jouer un role decisif quant au regard qu'ils portent sur la societe quebecoise, leur permettant ainsi de developper un Å“il critique sur les mÅ“urs en vigueur dans la province. Certains d'entre eux estiment qu'ils sont parfois juges sur d'autres criteres que leur pratique professionnelle, notamment selon leur appartenance culturelle. Le public semble curieux d'en savoir davantage sur les specificites de l'humoriste immigrant, ce qui pousserait ce dernier a devoir justifier de ses origines sur scene. En outre, les humoristes immigrants semblent accorder une grande importance au contenu social de leurs sketches, avec pour intention de partager leurs connaissances et d'amener a la reflexion. Toutefois, le chemin semble encore long avant que les humoristes immigrants puissent se faire une place au meme titre que les humoristes quebecois.

Hyperbaric oxygen at the Dead Sea.,"Summarized here are the proceedings of a workshop held at the Dead Sea on 2 November 2001 under the title ` Applications of Hyperbaric Therapy in the Dead Sea Area.'' This workshop was organized by the Dead Sea Research Center in collaboration with the Unit for Hyperbaric Therapy at the Ramban Medical Center, Haifa. In his opening remarks Shimon Moses, scientific director of the Dead Sea Research Center, mentioned the unique features of the Dead Sea basin, which, being part of the Syrian-African Rift Valley, represents the lowest spot on the lowest natural plateau at 414 meters below sea level. As a result of the evaporation of the Dead Sea water a layer of mist hangs over the sea. The combination of the low altitude and the mist results in a marked attenuation of the solar ultraviolet radiation. This unique attenuation of the solar ultraviolet waves, which has been studied by Avraham Kudish from the Solar Energy Laboratory of the Ben-Gurion University, has been shown to be of therapeutic value for a number of skin diseases, psoriasis being the most prominent. These climatic conditions, together with the thalasso-therapeutic properties of the unique salt composition of the Dead Sea water and the balneo-therapeutic effects of the sulfur-containing mineral waters, are known to be beneficial for various joint diseases. While these unique properties have been taken advantage of since biblical times, only recently has a scientific basis been established providing insight into the nature of these effects and establishing optimal exposure time and the relative part played by thalasso-therapy relative to solar radiation exposure. Dr. Kudish presented the results of his ongoing study on the barometric pressure during the various seasons of the year as observed in the Dead Sea basin. From his studies it is apparent that the highest percent increase above normal atmospheric barometric pressure occurs during the winter months and the lowest during the summer months. The monthly changes in barometric pressure can be attributed to the concomitant variations in the ambient temperature that affect the density of the air. It has been accepted that this increased barometric pressure, which is associated with a concomitant elevation of the ambient partial oxygen pressure, can be exploited for a number of diseases. In view of the seasonal changes mentioned above, it turns out that the months most suitable for therapies relating to higher barometric pressures are the winter months. Yehuda Melamed from the Hyperbaric Medical Unit at Rambam Hospital in Haifa reviewed the physiologic and clinical aspects of the use of hyperbaric oxygen. He presented a detailed description of the effects of hyperoxia on increasing arterial blood oxygenation, which is mainly achieved by increasing the amount of physically dissolved oxygen in the plasma. This offers an intravascular pool of oxygen at high partial pressures that is readily available for diffusion into hypoxic tissues. He also summarized mechanisms by which hyperoxia boosts repair of tissues by augmenting the killing of bacteria, and enhancing angiogenesis, collagen deposition and bone formation. Avi Shupak from the Israel Naval Medical Institute reviewed the physical and physiologic aspects of exposure to the hyperbaric/hyperoxic environment in the Dead Sea area, which offers only a 5% increase in the ambient oxygen partial pressure. This leads to only a small increase in the oxygen content of arterial blood. He presented data suggesting that even a small increase in oxygen partial pressure might lead to enhanced gene signaling and up-regulation of intrinsic anti-oxidant mechanisms. These suggested effects may lead to improvement in the ability to cope with pathologic conditions, characterized by augmented production of reactive oxygen species through mechanisms reminiscent of ischemic preconditioning. Haim Bitterman from Carmel Hospital and the Technion Faculty of Medicine in Haifa summarized the effects of hyperoxia on the cardiovascular system in normal and pathologic conditions. He presented data on the effects of hyperoxia during tissue ischemia, demonstrating that it causes redistribution of blood flow from adequately perfused tissues to areas of ischemia. He also summarized data showing that hyperoxia exerts a profound beneficial effect on local and remote inflammatory microcirculatory changes in ischemia and reperfusion. Some of the beneficial effects of hyperoxia are operative after relatively small increases in ambient oxygen partial pressures. Noemi Bitterman from the Neaman Institute at the Technion addressed possible implications of increased oxygen pressures on immunologic functions. The main findings point towards a transient immunosuppression (reflected in a decrease in CD4/CD8 ratio in peripheral blood) upon exposure to exaggerated oxygen pressures. Unfortunately there are only a few studies reporting the effects of hyperoxia on the",2002,The Israel Medical Association journal : IMAJ
Discussion: The Dantzig selector: Statistical estimation when p is much larger than n,"1. Computational considerations. When Lasso [11] was proposed, it was a computational challenge to solve the associated quadratic program min Î² 1 ï¿½ y âˆ’ XÎ² ï¿½ 2 s.t. ï¿½ Î²ï¿½ 1 â‰¤ t Lasso(t) given just a single parameter t. Two active-set methods were described in [11], with some concern about efficiency if p were large, where X is n Ã— p . Later when basis pursuit de-noising (BPDN) was introduced [2], the intention was to deal with p very large and to allow X to be a sparse matrix or a fast operator. A primalâ€“dual interior method was used to solve the associated quadratic program, but it remained a challenge to deal with a single parameter. The authorsâ€™ new Dantzig Selector (DS) also assumes a specific parameter. It is helpful to state the BPDN and DS models together: min Î²,r Î»ï¿½ Î²ï¿½ 1 + 1 ï¿½ rï¿½ 2 s.t. r = y âˆ’ XÎ², BPDN(Î») min Î²,r ï¿½ Î²ï¿½ 1 s.t. ï¿½ X T rï¿½ âˆž â‰¤ Î», r = y âˆ’ XÎ².

Lasso peptides: an intriguing class of bacterial natural products.,"Natural products of peptidic origin often represent a rich source of medically relevant compounds. The synthesis of such polypeptides in nature is either initiated by deciphering the genetic code on the ribosome during the translation process or driven by ribosome-independent processes. In the latter case, highly modified bioactive peptides are assembled by multimodular enzymes designated as nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) that act as a protein-template to generate chemically diverse peptides. On the other hand, the ribosome-dependent strategy, although relying strictly on the 20-22 proteinogenic amino acids, generates structural diversity by extensive post-translational-modification. This strategy seems to be highly distributed in all kingdoms of life. One example for this is the lasso peptides, which are an emerging class of ribosomally assembled and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) from bacteria that were first described in 1991. A wide range of interesting biological activities are known for these compounds, including antimicrobial, enzyme inhibitory, and receptor antagonistic activities. Since 2008, genome mining approaches allowed the targeted isolation and characterization of such molecules and helped to better understand this compound class and their biosynthesis. Their defining structural feature is a macrolactam ring that is threaded by the C-terminal tail and held in position by sterically demanding residues above and below the ring, resulting in a unique topology that is reminiscent of a lariat knot. The ring closure is achieved by an isopeptide bond formed between the N-terminal Î±-amino group of a glycine, alanine, serine, or cysteine and the carboxylic acid side chain of an aspartate or glutamate, which can be located at positions 7, 8, or 9 of the amino acid sequence. In this Account, we discuss the newest findings about these compounds, their biosynthesis, and their physicochemical properties. This includes the suggested mechanism through which the precursor peptide is enzymatically processed into a mature lasso peptide and crucial residues for enzymatic recognition. Furthermore, we highlight new insights considering the protease and thermal stability of lasso peptides and discuss why seven amino acid residue rings are likely to be the lower limit feasible for this compound class. To elucidate their fascinating three-dimensional structures, NMR spectroscopy is commonly employed. Therefore, the general methodology to elucidate these structures by NMR will be discussed and pitfalls for these approaches are highlighted. In addition, new tools provided by recent investigations to assess and prove the lasso topology without a complete structure elucidation will be summarized. These include techniques like ion mobility-mass spectrometry and a combined approach of thermal and carboxypeptidase treatment with subsequent LC-MS analysis. Nevertheless, even though much was learned about these compounds in recent years, their true native function and the exact enzymatic mechanism of their maturation remain elusive.",2015,Accounts of chemical research
Increased Inflammatory Activity in Patients 3 Months after Myocardial Infarction with Nonobstructive Coronary Arteries.,"BACKGROUND
Around 5%-10% of patients with myocardial infarction (MI) present with nonobstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA). We aimed to assess pathophysiological mechanisms in MINOCA by extensively evaluating cardiovascular biomarkers in the stable phase after an event, comparing MINOCA patients with cardiovascular healthy controls and MI patients with obstructive coronary artery disease (MI-CAD).


METHODS
Ninety-one biomarkers were measured with a proximity extension assay 3 months after MI in 97 MINOCA patients, 97 age- and sex-matched MI-CAD patients, and 98 controls. Lasso analyses (penalized logistic regression models) and adjusted multiple linear regression models were used for statistical analyses.


RESULTS
In the Lasso analysis (MINOCA vs MI-CAD), 8 biomarkers provided discriminatory value: P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1, C-X-C motif chemokine 1, TNF-related activation-induced cytokine, and pappalysin-1 (PAPPA) with increasing probabilities of MINOCA, and, tissue-type plasminogen activator, B-type natriuretic peptide, myeloperoxidase, and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist protein with increasing probabilities of MI-CAD. Comparing MINOCA vs controls, 7 biomarkers provided discriminatory value: N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, renin, NF-Îº-B essential modulator, PAPPA, interleukin-6, and soluble urokinase plasminogen activator surface receptor with increasing probabilities of MINOCA, and agouti-related protein with increasing probabilities of controls. Adjusted multiple linear regression analyses showed that group affiliation was associated with the concentrations of 7 of the 8 biomarkers in the comparison MINOCA vs MI-CAD and 5 of the 7 biomarkers in MINOCA vs controls.


CONCLUSIONS
Three months after the MI, the biomarker concentrations indicated greater inflammatory activity in MINOCA patients than in both MI-CAD patients and healthy controls, and a varying degree of myocardial dysfunction among the 3 cohorts.",2019,Clinical chemistry
Heterogeneous Employment Effects of Job Search Programmes: A Machine Learning Approach,"We systematically investigate the effect heterogeneity of job search programmes for unemployed workers. To investigate possibly heterogeneous employment effects, we combine non-experimental causal empirical models with Lasso-type estimators. The empirical analyses are based on rich administrative data from Swiss social security records. We find considerable heterogeneities only during the first six months after the start of training. Consistent with previous results of the literature, unemployed persons with fewer employment opportunities profit more from participating in these programmes. Furthermore, we also document heterogeneous employment effects by residence status. Finally, we show the potential of easy-to-implement programme participation rules for improving average employment effects of these active labour market programmes.",2020,Journal of Human Resources
Lasso Meets Horseshoe : A Survey.,"The goal of this paper is to contrast and survey the major advances in two of the most commonly used high-dimensional techniques, namely, the Lasso and horseshoe regularization. Lasso is a gold standard for predictor selection while horseshoe is a state-of-the-art Bayesian estimator for sparse signals. Lasso is fast and scalable and uses convex optimization whilst the horseshoe is non-convex. Our novel perspective focuses on three aspects: (i) theoretical optimality in high dimensional inference for the Gaussian sparse model and beyond, (ii) efficiency and scalability of computation and (iii) methodological development and performance.",2017,arXiv: Methodology

A Scaling and Non-Negative Garrote in Soft-Thresholding,"Soft-thresholding is a sparse modeling method typically applied to wavelet denoising in statistical signal processing. It is also important in machine learning since it is an essential nature of the well-known LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator). It is known that soft-thresholding, thus, LASSO suffers from a problem of dilemma between sparsity and generalization. This is caused by excessive shrinkage at a sparse representation. There are several methods for improving this problem in the field of signal processing and machine learning. In this paper, we considered to extend and analyze a method of scaling of soft-thresholding estimators. In a setting of non-parametric orthogonal regression problem including discrete wavelet transform, we introduced component-wise and data-dependent scaling that is indeed identical to non-negative garrote. We here considered a case where a parameter value of soft-thresholding is chosen from absolute values of the least squares estimates, by which the model selection problem reduces to the determination of the number of non-zero coefficient estimates. In this case, we firstly derived a risk and construct SURE (Steinâ€™s unbiased risk estimator) that can be used for determining the number of non-zero coefficient estimates. We also analyzed some properties of the risk curve and found that our scaling method with the derived SURE is possible to yield a model with low risk and high sparsity compared to a naive soft-thresholding method with SURE. This theoretical speculation was verified by a simple numerical experiment of wavelet denoising. key words: soft-thresholding, SURE, non-negative garrote, scaling, wavelet denoising",2017,IEICE Trans.

Monitoring Glycemic Control in Diabetes,"than 2 years. Hydrocodone products are now under scrutiny, the FDA said, because of medication errors associated with formulation changes in unapproved products and reports of confusion over the similarity of the names with approved products. Safety issues were also raised by more than 400 cases of serious adverse events associated with antitussive hydrocodone products reported to the FDA between 1969 and 2005. There are also concerns that labeling on the unapproved products may encourage physicians to prescribe them to children younger than 6 years, said Jason Woo, MD, associate director of Medical and Scientific Affairs in the FDAâ€™s Office of Compliance. â€œUnapprovedproductsmayhavebeen marketed to physicians by the manufacturerordistributorwiththemessagethat theproduct is safe forchildrenunder the age of 6,â€ Woo said. â€œHowever, none of the approved products have been approved for children under 6 and, in fact, theyarespecifically labelednot tobeused forchildrenunder6.Thisisoneofthereasonswhythisactionisanimportantsafety issue for the agencyâ€”to assure that prescribing physicians are given correct information on approved products and to informthemofthis incorrectclaimbythe unapprovedproductsinthemarketplace.â€ The FDA ordered manufacturers to stop making and distributing unapproved cough suppressants with labels indicating use in children younger than 6 years by October 31, to stop making those not labeled for use in children under 6 by December 31, and to stop interstate shipments by March 31, 2008. However, the products can remain on pharmacy shelves for an unspecified period after these deadlines. TheBrandedPharmaceuticalAssociation (BPA), a trade group representing specialtydrugmanufacturers,marketers, and distributors, argued their hydrocodone products have a long history of safetyandeffectiveness, andsaid thatgoing through the FDA approval process would cost millions of dollars and raise the prices of these medications. â€œIt would seem more prudent for the FDA to use its limited resources assuring that marketed products are correctly labeled and prescribed instead of taking actions which severely disrupt the marketplace and will surely be windfalls to a handful of companies,â€ the trade association said in a statement. Larry D. Sasich, PharmD, acting chair, Department of Pharmacy Practice at the Lake Erie College of Medicine School of Pharmacy in Erie, Pa, said the FDA action is warranted due to the labeling problems. Sasich, who represents the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen on an FDA advisory committee, added that arguments that a product has been on the market for decades is not reason enough to keep it on pharmacy shelves. â€œWe canâ€™t forget that science evolves, and weâ€™re in the 21st century,â€ Sasich said. â€œWhy should we be using early 20th-century standards?â€",2007,JAMA
Regularized Estimation of the Nominal Response Model.,"The nominal response model is an item response theory model that does not require the ordering of the response options. However, while providing a very flexible modeling approach of polytomous responses, it involves the estimation of many parameters at the risk of numerical instability and overfitting. The lasso is a technique widely used to achieve model selection and regularization. In this paper, we propose the use of a fused lasso penalty to group response categories and perform regularization of the unidimensional and multidimensional nominal response models. The good performance of the method is illustrated through real-data applications and simulation studies.",2019,Multivariate behavioral research
On Age of the Houcheng Formation in Hebei in the Light of Palynological Evidence,"The Houcheng Formation distributed in northern Hebei Province is composed mainly of the fluvial red sandstone and conglomerate rocks,occasionally with fluvial sandy mudstone and intermediate and acidic volcanic beds and partly with thin coal seams. Its age was assigned on different fossil evidences to Late Middle Jurassic,Late Jurassic or early Late Jurassic. The present palynological assemblage from this formation in Yuxian is characterized by plenty of spores Cyathidites(70% in content) ,with a few spore Neoraistrickia gristhorpensis,Asseretospora parva and gymnospermous pollen Classopollis,non-striate bisaccates,obviously indicating a Middle Jurassic age,and is quite different the assemblage from the same formation in Xuanhua and Wanquan which is dominate by Classopollis pollen(91% in content) ,associated with some bisaccate pollen and rare Cacatricosisporites and Schizaeoisporite and was referred by Zhang Wang-ping(1984) to Late Jurassic in age. The differences between the two palynological data demonstrate that the Houcheng Formatin is a sequence from Middle to Late Jurassic age.",2009,Journal of stratigraphy
GROUP SPARSE OPTIMIZATION BY ALTERNATING DIRECTION METHOD Report Title,"This paper proposes efficient algorithms for group sparse optimization with mixed l2,1-regularization, which arises from the reconstruction of group sparse signals in compressive sensing, and the group Lasso problem in statistics and machine learning. It is known that encoding the group information in addition to sparsity will lead to better signal recovery/feature selection. The l2,1-regularization promotes group sparsity, but the resulting problem, due to the mixed-norm structure and possible grouping irregularity, is considered more difficult to solve than the conventional l1-regularized problem. Our approach is based on a variable splitting strategy and the classic alternating direction method (ADM). Two algorithms are presented, one derived from the primal and the other from the dual of the l2,1-regularized problem. The convergence of the proposed algorithms is guaranteed by the existing ADM theory. General group configurations such as overlapping groups and incomplete covers can be easily handled by our approach. Computational results show that on random problems the proposed ADM algorithms exhibit good efficiency, and strong stability and robustness. GROUP SPARSE OPTIMIZATION BY ALTERNATING DIRECTION METHOD WEI DENG, WOTAO YIN, AND YIN ZHANGâˆ— Abstract. This paper proposes efficient algorithms for group sparse optimization with mixed `2,1-regularization, which arises from the reconstruction of group sparse signals in compressive sensing, and the group Lasso problem in statistics and machine learning. It is known that encoding the group information in addition to sparsity will lead to better signal recovery/feature selection. The `2,1-regularization promotes group sparsity, but the resulting problem, due to the mixed-norm structure and possible grouping irregularity, is considered more difficult to solve than the conventional `1-regularized problem. Our approach is based on a variable splitting strategy and the classic alternating direction method (ADM). Two algorithms are presented, one derived from the primal and the other from the dual of the `2,1-regularized problem. The convergence of the proposed algorithms is guaranteed by the existing ADM theory. General group configurations such as overlapping groups and incomplete covers can be easily handled by our approach. Computational results show that on random problems the proposed ADM algorithms exhibit good efficiency, and strong stability and robustness.",2012,
"Macroeconomic conditions, corporate defaults, and economic recessions","In this thesis, I investigate effective predictors for corporate defaults and measurement of economic recessions. I use corporate default probabilities in US industrial firms from April 1980 to December 2014 and effective predictors extracted from 92 macroeconomic and financial variables and I propose a framework to determine whether there is a dynamic in effective predictors for US corporate defaults. 
 
I apply LASSO, an advanced variable selection technique, and I find that there are no macro factors that can consistently explain default risk over time, suggesting that default risk has been dynamic during the 35-year period. These dynamics persist even during non-recession periods. Interestingly, the strong predictive powers of macro factors over shorter periods are related to monetary policy indicators and tools, which provides empirical support for prior theoretical theories that emphasize the unique role of monetary policies in corporate defaults. 
Another interesting finding is that institutional market funding, as the liquidity source provided by non-bank groups, has gradually impacted on corporate defaults since the 2001 recession. In the financial crisis occuring in 2007 this money market funds (MMFs) have strongest impact on corproate defaults. This implies that MMFs paly a crucial role of destabilizing credit markets in recent years, which is consistent with current studies of whether MMFs can result in financial stability. 
 
I study US economic recessions by introducing a cutting-edged technique from the Natural Sciences in order to capture the critical transitions in the macroeconomic system, using hundreds of macroeconomic and financial variables covering the period January 1980 to December 2014. Based on this method, I construct macro indicators to measure the interactions among these variables in order to capture the critical transitions in the macroeconomic system. Then I employ a standard logit model to study whether these proposed indicators offer a prediction one-month ahead of US economic recessions from September 1980 to December 2014. 
 
I find that the interactions among macroeconomic and financial variables measured by covariance among these variables can provide one-month ahead prediction for US economic recessions. In particular, the best predictive macro indicators are constructed by employing procyclical factors and factors from six economic groups based on results from both in-sample and out-of-sample analysis. Regarding the standard ideal indicator defined by Shiskin and Moore (1967), the indicator constructed by procyclical factors is preferable over that constructed by the factors from six economic groups since the former is smoother. I also find that the threshold based on 25% for classifying the recessions can generate better estimation results than using 50%, consistent with prior studies. In forecasting economic recessions in the US, the indicator generated by using broad macro factors is able to provide predictive power. The implication of these results is to provide a new quantitative approach for central bankers and policy makers to predict economic recessions one month ahead.",2017,
Courtship displays and coloration as indicators of safety rather than of male quality : the safety assurance hyposthesis,"Male courtship displays and bright coloration are usually assumed to provide information to females about some aspect of the maleâ€™s value as a mate. However, in some species, courtship may serve another functionâ€”namely, indicating the current predation risk at the mating site and assuring the female that it is safe to mate there at this time. We developed this safety assurance hypothesis (SAH) and tested its predictions in the bluehead wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum), a Caribbean reef fish. Females in this species come to malesâ€™ territories to spawn, and males court each arriving female. Males with larger white flank patches court less intensely than less bright males. We show that such males are probably more visible to predators and thus need not court so intensely to provide the same degree of safety assurance to a female. When model lizardfish predators are presented at spawning sites, males habituate to them quickly, but newly arriving females who see the predator are expected to demand more assurance of site safety. Accordingly, and consistent with the SAH, males court females more intensely (longer average courtship bout length) under such circumstances, but males with bright flank patches do not increase their courtship as much as duller males do. Despite this relatively low intensity of courtship, the spawning rate of bright males does not decline relative to that of duller males in the presence of a predator, suggesting that bright coloration conveys a differential benefit. Females of species like the bluehead wrasse, who spawn repeatedly over the course of their life, are expected to be more concerned with their own risk of mortality during each spawning bout than with the quality of a particular male. It is in such species that we expect the SAH to be most applicable. Key words: bluehead wrasse, coral reefs, courtship behavior, fish, risk aversion, safety, Thalassoma bifasciatum.

Regularized Logistic Models for Probabilistic Forecasting and Diagnostics,"Logistic models are studied as a tool to convert dynamical forecast information (deterministic and ensemble) into probability forecasts. A logistic model is obtained by setting the logarithmic odds ratio equal to a linear combination of the inputs. As with any statistical model, logistic models will suffer from overfitting if the number of inputs is comparable to the number of forecast instances. Computational approaches to avoid overfitting by regularization are discussed, and efficient techniques for model assessment and selection are presented. A logit version of the lasso (originally a linear regression technique), is discussed. In lasso models, less important inputs are identified and the corresponding coefficient is set to zero, providing an efficient and automatic model reduction procedure. For the same reason, lasso models are particularly appealing for diagnostic purposes.",2010,Monthly Weather Review
Search in spatial scale-free networks,"We study the decentralized search problem in a family of parameterized spatial network models that are heterogeneous in node degree. We investigate several algorithms and illustrate that some of these algorithms exploit the heterogeneity in the network to find short paths by using only local information. In addition, we demonstrate that the spatial network model belongs to a classof searchable networks for a wide range of parameter space. Further, we test these algorithms on the US airline network which belongs to this class of networks and demonstrate that searchability is a generic property of the US airline network. These results provide insights on designing the structure of distributed networks that need effective decentralized search algorithms.",2007,New Journal of Physics

On Strong Small Loop Transfer Spaces Relative to Subgroups of Fundamental Groups,"Let $H$ be a subgroup of the fundamental group $\pi_{1}(X,x_{0})$. By extending the concept of strong SLT space to a relative version with respect to $H$, strong $H$-SLT space, first, we investigate the existence of a covering map for strong $H$-SLT spaces. Moreover, we show that a semicovering map is a covering map in the presence of strong $H$-SLT property. Second, we present conditions under which the whisker topology agrees with the lasso topology on $\widetilde{X}_{H}$. Also, we study the relationship between open subsets of $\pi_{1}^{wh}(X,x_{0})$ and $\pi_{1}^{l}(X,x_{0})$. Finally, we give some examples to justify the definition and study of strong $H$-SLT spaces.",2017,
Do Red Edge and Texture Attributes from High-Resolution Satellite Data Improve Wood Volume Estimation in a Semi-Arid Mountainous Region?,"Remote sensing-based woody biomass quantification in sparsely-vegetated areas is often limited when using only common broadband vegetation indices as input data for correlation with ground-based measured biomass information. Red edge indices and texture attributes are often suggested as a means to overcome this issue. However, clear recommendations on the suitability of specific proxies to provide accurate biomass information in semi-arid to arid environments are still lacking. This study contributes to the understanding of using multispectral high-resolution satellite data (RapidEye), specifically red edge and texture attributes, to estimate wood volume in semi-arid ecosystems characterized by scarce vegetation. LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) and random forest were used as predictive models relating in situ-measured aboveground standing wood volume to satellite data. Model performance was evaluated based on cross-validation bias, standard deviation and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) at the logarithmic and non-logarithmic scales. Both models achieved rather limited performances in wood volume prediction. Nonetheless, model performance increased with red edge indices and texture attributes, which shows that they play an important role in semi-arid regions with sparse vegetation.",2016,Remote Sensing
"An Evaluation of Analytical and Interpretative Methodologies for the Extraction and Identification of Lipids Associated with Pottery Sherds from the Site of Sagalassos, Turkey *","Three lipid analysis methods were applied to extracts of archaeological potsherds from the ancient city of Sagalassos, south-west Turkey. In the fatty acid methyl ester fraction, obtained by selective transesterification of acylglycerols, the ratio of methyl palmitate to methyl stearate was determined. Secondly, by means of gas chromatographyâ€ combustionâ€isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GCâ€Câ€IRMS), stable carbon isotope ratios were measured for the same methyl esters. Finally, triglyceride composition was determined via high-performance liquid chromatographyâ€mass spectrometry (HPLCâ€MS). All three methods can be used to trace the origin of animal fat. Agreement between them is reasonable, especially in recognizing ruminant adipose fat. One sample was found to be of dairy origin using both GCâ€Câ€IRMS and HPLCâ€MS. The advantages of the various methods are discussed. Variations in lipid composition were observed between samples from different periods and excavated in diverse areas within the city of Sagalassos.",2007,Archaeometry
Differential co-expression network centrality and machine learning feature selection for identifying susceptibility hubs in networks with scale-free structure,"BackgroundBiological insights into group differences, such as disease status, have been achieved through differential co-expression analysis of microarray data. Additional understanding of group differences may be achieved by integrating the connectivity structure of the differential co-expression network and per-gene differential expression between phenotypic groups. Such a global differential co-expression network strategy may increase sensitivity to detect gene-gene interactions (or expression epistasis) that may act as candidates for rewiring susceptibility co-expression networks.MethodsWe test two methods for inferring Genetic Association Interaction Networks (GAIN) incorporating both differential co-expression effects and differential expression effects: a generalized linear model (GLM) regression method with interaction effects (reGAIN) and a Fisher test method for correlation differences (dcGAIN). We rank the importance of each gene with complete interaction network centrality (CINC), which integrates each geneâ€™s differential co-expression effects in the GAIN model along with each geneâ€™s individual differential expression measure. We compare these methods with statistical learning methods Relief-F, Random Forests and Lasso. We also develop a mixture model and permutation approach for determining significant importance score thresholds for network centralities, Relief-F and Random Forest. We introduce a novel simulation strategy that generates microarray caseâ€“control data with embedded differential co-expression networks and underlying correlation structure based on scale-free or Erdos-Renyi (ER) random networks.ResultsUsing the network simulation strategy, we find that Relief-F and reGAIN provide the best balance between detecting interactions and main effects, plus reGAIN has the ability to adjust for covariates and model quantitative traits. The dcGAIN approach performs best at finding differential co-expression effects by design but worst for main effects, and it does not adjust for covariates and is limited to dichotomous outcomes. When the underlying network is scale free instead of ER, all interaction network methods have greater power to find differential co-expression effects. We apply these methods to a public microarray study of the differential immune response to influenza vaccine, and we identify effects that suggest a role in influenza vaccine immune response for genes from the PI3K family, which includes genes with known immunodeficiency function, and KLRG1, which is a known marker of senescence.",2015,BioData Mining

Tra i diversi sistemi impiegati, il monitoraggio acustico e risultato idoneo all'individuazione di eventuali distacchi di blocchi. Un'applicazione di questa tecnica e stata impiegata all'interno della miniera abbandonata della Brasserie, situata a sud-est di Parigi (Francia).

La presente investigacion tuvo como objetivo evaluar la relacion entre la longitud total del pez y el tamano de su territorio en las diferentes tipos de colonias arrecifales (masivo y ramificado). Para esto, se realizaron observaciones aleatorias durante 15 minutos a diferentes individuos de S. acapulcoensis en el arrecife La Azufrada, Isla Gorgona (2Â°55â€™45â€™â€™â€“3Â°00â€™55â€™â€™N, 78Â°09-78Â°14â€™30â€™â€™W); se registro el tamano del jardin de algas, el numero de parches y la longitud total del pez utilizando una cinta metrica (Â±0,01cm), tambien se registraron las especies de peces con las que interactuaba. Se observo un total de 33 individuos; el promedio de las longitudes de los peces fue 11,5 Â±3,4 ); la media del area defendida 6,5 Â±5,9. No se encontro relacion positiva entre la longitud del pez y el area defendida (p=0,88); sin embargo, al analizar las colonias individualmente, se encontro una relacion positiva (p=0,015) sobre corales masivos . Las relaciones encontradas indican que el territorio defendido depende tambien de las actividades que el pez realiza durante el dia, como la reproduccion, la alimentacion, la autopreservacion etc. La presencia de una relacion positiva entre el tamano del pez y el tamano del tapete en colonias masivas, posiblemente se deba a la preferencia por esta topografia; sin embargo, en la zona de estudio la disponibilidad de las colonias masivas es limitada, lo que obliga a los individuos de menor tamano a utilizar colonias ramificadas para el establecimiento de las algas, en la que pueden crecer sin mayor restriccion. Finalmente, se observo una alta conducta defensiva por parte de Stegastes contraÂ  Thalassoma lucasanum y Chromis atrilobata. Se recomiendan ampliar estudios de territorialidad en torno a las diferentes actividades que realizan.",2015,
Deleuze and Beckett: An Immanent Encounter,"Understanding the exact nature of Deleuze's debt to Kant forms a large part of contemporary Deleuzian scholarship, a project made all the more urgent since the publication of Meillassoux's critique of correlationism in 2007. These Kantian readings present Deleuze as someone who continues Kant's transcendental project by reconsidering the nature of â€˜immanent critiqueâ€™. Immanent critique is no longer seen here as part of the critical enquiry into the possible conditions of experience, but as a staging of an encounter with the genetic principle constituting these conditions, the real condition common to both the human subject and the world in which he or she lives. Such is the implicit demand of genetic recasting: that critique in its immanent form is something we can experience and learn. Presented with this demand, this essay addresses the problem of staging this immanent form of critique. It looks to Deleuze's essay on the work of Samuel Beckett, â€˜The Exhaustedâ€™, to suggest a possible site for such an enc...",2014,Deleuze Studies
