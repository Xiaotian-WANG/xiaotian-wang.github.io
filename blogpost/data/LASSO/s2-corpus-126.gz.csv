Toxic and mutagenic action of the herbicide alachlor (lasso) on various strains of the nitrogen-fixing blue-green alga Nostoc muscorum and characterization of the herbicide-induced mutants resistant to methylamine and l-methionine-dl-sulfoximine,"Abstract Alachlor (lasso), like butachlor (machete) shows mutagenic properties when tested in Nostoc muscorum systems. The mutagenicity of the two herbicides seems considerably higher than that of MNNG ( N -methyl- N â€²-nitro- N -nhitrosoguanidine). A dose of alachlor considerably higher than that of butachlor is needed to obtain a comparable level of growth inhibition and mutagenesis, thus suggesting that butachlor is the more efficient mutagen. Methylamine-resistant (MA-R) and l -methionine- dl -sulfoximine-resistant (MSO-R) mutants have been obtained spontaneously or following mutagenic treatment with either herbicide. MA-R strains appear to metabolize methylamine as a nitrogen source. MSO-R strains do not form heterocysts in NO 3 âˆ’ or NH 4 + medium containing or lacking MSO; the parent N. muscorum does not form heterocysts in NO 3 âˆ’ or NH 4 + medium lacking MSO but does form them in either nitrogen medium containing MSO.",1979,Environmental and Experimental Botany

La femme chaotique qui fusionne en elle tous les elements du monde visible et invisible symbolise la poetique de la reception. GrÃ¢ce a son ubiquite, la femme creative, produisant partout les etres humains et naturels pareils a elle, manifeste la poetique de l'alterite. En outre, situee entre les elements de l'univers, la femme mediatrice reunit les antinomiques, pour representer la poetique du rapport. Enfin, la femme renaissante concretise la poetique de la vivacite, en allant de la mort a la vie, de la nuit a l'aurore. Face a ces femmes, le moi poetique manifeste sa volonte de se communiquer, en employant souvent â€œl'appelationâ€ qui est une strategie efficace pour attirer l'attention du recepteur. De plus, il utilise la metaphore afin d'identifier la femme avec tous les elements du monde. Il assure que l'union entre le toi et le monde garantit celle entre le toi et le moi. Il s'agit d'un lyrisme de l'alterite qui s'ouvre vers le monde et autrui. Il est concretise par le paysage cosmique de la femme, compose des sentiments, des concepts abstraits et du monde exterieur. Les caracteristiques de la femme sont eclairees par son rapport avec la rue qui symbolise l'avancement de l'etre et du monde et leur rencontre. La femme chaotique apprivoise la rue enfouie dans le noir, en l'ouvrant ou la fermant a son gre. Elle engendre ainsi un nouvel ordre dans le desordre. Devant cette femme, les tensions entre l'enfermement et la delivrance, entre l'ombre et la lumiere s'effondrent. Quant a la femme maternelle, elle abolit toutes les routes grÃ¢ce a son ubiquite. En dehors du temps et de l'espace habituels, elle engendre partout ses enfants pareils a elle. Cette femme permet ainsi au monde et aux etres de durer infinimemt. La femme mediatrice joue le role mediateur en englobant les humains, les organiques, les inorganiques, le monde et le temps. Dans cette femme metaphorisee par le paysage transparent, tous les routes se relient et personne n'y se perd. La femme-phenix annonce qu'au bout d'une rue en commence une autre, ce qui montre la demarche cyclique : la fin devient le debut, et la mort devient la vie. Ainsi, les femmes eluardiennes renoncent aux rues existantes et unilaterales. Transformables et multiformes, elles ouvrent infiniment une nouvelle rue et un nouvel espace. Les quatres types feminins que nous avons envisages chronologiquement representent la demarche cyclique de la poesie eluardienne, allant du chaos a la renaissance en passant par la creation et la mediation. Par rapport a la poesie de sa premiere periode ou fusionnent les images et les langages breves et morcelees, celle de sa derniere periode syntetise en une seule unite tous les elements epars. La poesie d'Eluard impregnee de caracteristiques feminines brille par son langage sensuel et vivace, et manifeste la poetique de l'ouverture vers le monde de l'autre.",2003,
Supervised Learning for Dynamical System Learning,"Recently there has been substantial interest in spectral methods for learning dynamical systems. These methods are popular since they often offer a good tradeoff between computational and statistical efficiency. Unfortunately, they can be difficult to use and extend in practice: e.g., they can make it difficult to incorporate prior information such as sparsity or structure. To address this problem, we present a new view of dynamical system learning: we show how to learn dynamical systems by solving a sequence of ordinary supervised learning problems, thereby allowing users to incorporate prior knowledge via standard techniques such as L1 regularization. Many existing spectral methods are special cases of this new framework, using linear regression as the supervised learner. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by showing examples where nonlinear regression or lasso let us learn better state representations than plain linear regression does; the correctness of these instances follows directly from our general analysis.",2015,Advances in neural information processing systems
Optimizing large portfolios using factors and sparse hedging,"In this paper we make use of a combination of financial factors and sparse hedging portfolios to allocate a large number of assets into a minimum variance portfolio. Regularized hedging portfolios can be formed using the graphical lasso but relies on statistical sparsity assumptions. The financial factors serve an important role to make these assumptions more suitable. In turn, the estimated hedging portfolios complement the factor model by allowing for deviations from the strict factor structure. The method includes two important features, it makes it possible to avoid the explicit high-dimensional matrix inversion. Secondly, it imposes sparsity restrictions on the partial correlations instead of the pairwise correlation of returns. Empirically, we find that this method tends to reduce portfolio volatility more than prominent alternative methods. The performance improvements are statistically significant and greatest when high-dimensional matrix inversion is completely circumvented.",2020,
The More Obese - The Less Pubertal Height Gain,"Results â€“age at onset of pubertal growth There was a linear correlation of obesity degree (BMISDS) and onset of pubertal growth (AgeP5): 9.67 years 0.121 x BMISDS in girls, 11.59 years 0.115 x BMISDS in boys (Fig 5). The results were similar to the results from the population study (with AgeP5 9.82 years 0.137 x BMISDS in girls, 11.81 years 0.127 x BMISDS in boys), meaning that every increase in BMISDS by 1 SD-score give an earlier onset of pubertal growth by 1.4-1.6 month (both sexes, both study groups).

Machine Learning predictive model of grapevine yield based on agroclimatic patterns,"Abstract Grapevine yield prediction during phenostage and particularly, before harvest is highly significant as advanced forecasting could be a great value for superior grapevine management. The main contribution of the current study is to develop predictive model for each phenology that predicts yield during growing stages of grapevine and to identify highly relevant predictive variables. Current study uses climatic conditions, grapevine yield, phenological dates, fertilizer information, soil analysis and maturation index data to construct the relational dataset. After words, we use several approaches to pre-process the data to put it into tabular format. For instance, generalization of climatic variables using phenological dates. Random Forest, LASSO and Elasticnet in generalized linear models, and Spikeslab are feature selection embedded methods which are used to overcome dataset dimensionality issue. We used 10-fold cross validation to evaluate predictive model by partitioning the dataset into training set to train the model and test set to evaluate it by calculating Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Relative Root Mean Squared Error (RRMSE). Results of the study show that rf_PF, rf_PC and rf_MH are optimal models for flowering (PF), colouring (PC) and harvest (MH) phenology respectively which estimate 1484.5, 1504.2 and 1459.4 (Kg/ha) low RMSE and 24.6%, 24.9% and 24.2% RRMSE, respectively as compared to other models. These models also identify some derived climatic variables as major variables for grapevine yield prediction. The reliability and early-indication ability of these forecast models justify their use by institutions and economists in decision making, adoption of technical improvements, and fraud detection.",2019,"Engineering in agriculture, environment and food"
The Quintessence of Child Conduct Problems: Identifying Central Behaviors through Network Analysis,"Child conduct problems are generally treated as a latent construct or as an additive index, where indicators are considered equally reflective indicators, in line with the â€œcommon cause hypothesisâ€. The current study presents a third alternative, where conduct problems constitute behaviors that associate and interact, in terms of a multivariate network structure. The aims of the study were to investigate the network structure of conduct problems and reveal strongly connected and central behaviors. Child gender and age were included into the analyses to uncover how these relate to the specific behaviors. The sample comprised of parent-reported data of 551 Norwegian children (age 3â€“12) with moderate to high levels of conduct problems, who reported intensity of 22 behaviors using the Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory. The research questions were examined by estimating a correlational and partial correlational LASSO network of conduct problems. Results showed that behaviors in general were positively connected. The majority of behaviors clustered into two distinct domains, reflecting inattention and oppositional defiant behavior. Furthermore, results showed that behaviors showed differential centrality, i.e., not all behaviors were equally important to the conceptualization of child conduct problems. Implications of the results for assessment and intervention are discussed.",2019,Journal of Psychopathology and Behavioral Assessment
Radiomic Nomogram Improves Preoperative T Category Accuracy in Locally Advanced Laryngeal Carcinoma,"Surgical decision-making on advanced laryngeal carcinoma is heavily depended on the identification of preoperative T category (T3 vs. T4), which is challenging for surgeons. A T category prediction radiomics (TCPR) model would be helpful for subsequent surgery. A total of 211 patients with locally advanced laryngeal cancer who had undergone total laryngectomy were randomly classified into the training cohort (n = 150) and the validation cohort (n = 61). We extracted 1,390 radiomic features from the contrast-enhanced computed tomography images. Interclass correlation coefficient and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) analyses were performed to select features associated with pathology-confirmed T category. Eight radiomic features were found associated with preoperative T category. The radiomic signature was constructed by Support Vector Machine algorithm with the radiomic features. We developed a nomogram incorporating radiomic signature and T category reported by experienced radiologists. The performance of the model was evaluated by the area under the curve (AUC). The T category reported by radiologists achieved an AUC of 0.775 (95% CI: 0.667-0.883); while the radiomic signature yielded a significantly higher AUC of 0.862 (95% CI: 0.772-0.952). The predictive performance of the nomogram incorporating radiomic signature and T category reported by radiologists further improved, with an AUC of 0.892 (95% CI: 0.811-0.974). Consequently, for locally advanced laryngeal cancer, the TCPR model incorporating radiomic signature and T category reported by experienced radiologists have great potential to be applied for individual accurate preoperative T category. The TCPR model may benefit decision-making regarding total laryngectomy or larynx-preserving treatment.",2019,Frontiers in Oncology

Nous montrons egalement que les efficacites relatives de traduction des arnm hybrides lacz peuvent etre largement modulees par les conditions de croissance. Selon leur reponse a un changement des conditions de croissance, nous classons les arnm en deux categories. Le changement des conditions de croissance modifie de nombreux parametres cellulaires. Nous testons donc l'effet des variations de differents parametres sur les efficacites de traduction des arnm hybrides lacz et discutons de l'eventuelle generalite de ce phenomene",1992,
Italian Deep-Sea Exploration in the Mediterranean,"AFTER some delay, beyond our control, the war-steamer of the Italian Royal Navy Washington, Capt. G. B. Magnanghi, R.N., left Maddalena on the 2nd inst. on her thallassographic mission. Under the able direction of Capt. Magnaghi, two days were devoted to preliminary dredgings and trawlings in depths from 200 to 1000 metres, principally for testing our apparatus, which works admirably. On the 4th inst. (yesterday afternoon) we did our first deep-sea dredging in 3000 metres; the dredge came up empty, but I had the pleasure of securing, attached to the hempen tangles, a magnificent specimen of that strange blind Crustacean discovered by the Challenger in the North Atlantic, and named WillemÃ¦sia leptodactyla; it is no doubt one of the most characteristic forms of the deep-sea fauna, and its discovery in the Mediterranean is of very great importance and interest, as all students of thalassography will be fully aware, after what Dr. Carpenter has written on the biological conditions of the deeper parts of that sea. Our specimen of WillemÃ¦sia is slightly smaller than the one dredged by the Challenger, and figured in Sir Wyville Thomson's â€œAtlantic,â€ vol. i. p. 189; but otherwise it differs only in one or two minor details, which may be sexual differences; it was dredged off the west coast of Sardinia.",1881,Nature
Identify optimal predictors of statistical downscaling of summer daily precipitation in China from three-dimensional large-scale variables,"Abstract Statistical downscaling (SD) of daily precipitation is a challenging task, and the identification of predictors is crucial for constructing SD models. This study focuses on identifying SD predictors for summer (Juneâ€“September) daily precipitation in China. Six large-scale variables (LSVs) in ERA-Interim reanalysis were used to select predictors for 177 sites. For each site, the predictor identification was conducted by searching the grid box having the best correlation to precipitation in a three-dimensional way: across different grid boxes and multiple pressure levels. The result indicates that correlations are often sensitive to the pressure levels. Adjacent sites share similar spatial patterns of correlations, indicating regionally different physical relations between LSVs and precipitation. The predictor selection reasonably reflects the regional circulations related to precipitation. Twelve candidate predictors were used to train generalized linear models by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm. The validation indicates the models have generally high performance, and also shows relatively poor performance for the sites in North China, Northwest China, and Yunnan when compared to that in the east of China. The downscaled outputs can roughly reflect the annual variations of summer total precipitation and rainy days. Two experiments on the stationarity assumption of the models under different climate conditions were conducted, indicating that no areas/sites were found significantly violated the stationarity assumption. This study presents guidance on how to select suitable predictors for downscaling daily precipitation in different areas of China.",2019,Atmospheric Research

Improving the prediction performance of the LASSO by subtracting the additive structural noises,It is shown that the prediction performance of the LASSO method is improved for high dimensional data sets by subtracting structural noises through a sparse additive partially linear model. A mild combination of the partial residual estimation method and the back-fitting algorithm by further implying the LASSO method to the predictors of the linear part is proposed to estimate the parameters. The method is applied to the riboflavin production data set and a simulation study is conducted to examine the performance of the proposed method.,2019,Computational Statistics

Welche Faktoren beeinflussen die LÃ¤nge des Klinikaufenthaltes bei Patienten nach Bandscheibenoperationen,"ZusammenfassungAn einem Krankengut von 678 operativ behandelten FÃ¤llen mit lumbalem Bandscheibenvorfall wurden diejenigen Faktoren statistisch analysiert, die mÃ¶glicherweise EinfluÃŸ auf die postoperative Behandlungszeit im Krankenhaus hatten.Keinen EinfluÃŸ hatten folgende Faktoren: LÃ¤nge der Anamnese, Familienstand, StaatsangehÃ¶rigkeit, Perforation des Ligamentum longitudinale posterius durch den Prolaps, Vorhandensein einer Osteochondrose, Curettage des Intervertebralspaltes, HÃ¶henlokalisation des Prolapses.WÃ¤hrend der Beobachtungszeit (1957 bis 1965) hatte die Verweildauer eine fallende Tendenz. VerlÃ¤ngerte Verweildauer ergab sich nach Laminektomie, bei Patienten mit medialem Vorfall, bei Ã¤lteren Patienten, bei Frauen sowie bei versicherten Patienten. Faktoren, welche die Verweildauer verkÃ¼rzen, waren laterale Lokalisation des Bandscheibenvorfalles, mÃ¤nnliches Geschlecht und die NichtangehÃ¶rigkeit zur Sozialversicherung.SummaryIn a series of 678 operated patients with lumbar intervertebral disc protrusion those factors were statistically analysed which had a possible influence on the time spent under treatment in hospital post-operatively.The following factors had no influence: the lenght of the history, marital status, nationality, perforation of the posterior longitudinal ligament by the prolapse, presence of osteophytes, curettage of the intervertebral cleft, the level of the disc lesion.During the period of time studied (1957â€“1965) the length of hospital stay showed a tendency to fall. Increased hospital stay occurred after laminectomy in patients with a central prolaps, in older patients, in women and also in insured patients. Factors which shortened the post-operative stay were lateral disc protrusions, the male sex, and the absence of any social insurance.RÃ©sumÃ©Les auteurs ont analysÃ© 618 patients opÃ©rÃ©s pour hernie discale lombaire afin de dÃ©terminer les facteurs qui ont pu influencer la durÃ©e de l'hospitalisation aprÃ¨s la chirurgie.Les facteurs suivants n'ont eu aucune influence: la durÃ©e des symptomes, l'Ã©tat civil, la nationalitÃ©, la perforation du ligament longitudinal postÃ©rieur, la prÃ©sence d'ostÃ©ophytes, le curetage de l'espace intervertÃ©bral, le niveau de la lÃ©sion.L'Ã©tude a portÃ© sur la pÃ©riode s'Ã©tendant de 1957 Ã  1965 et on a constatÃ© une tendance Ã  la diminution de la durÃ©e de l'hospitalisation au cours des annÃ©es.La durÃ©e de l'hospitalisation fut plus longue chez ceux qui prÃ©sentaient une hernie discale centrale, chez les patients plus agÃ©s chez les femmes et chez les patients qui Ã©taient assurÃ©s. La durÃ©e de l'hospitalisation fut plus courte chez ceux qui prÃ©sentaient une hernie discale latÃ©rale, chez les hommes et chez ceux qui n'Ã©taient pas assurÃ©s.RiassuntoIn un materiale di 678 operati di ernia discale furono statisticamente analizzati quei fattori che possono avere un influsso sulla durata del tempo di degenza postoperatoria in clinica. Nessuna importanza hanno mostrato i seguenti fattori: durata della anamnesi, condizione familiare, cittadinanza, perforazione del legamento longitudinale posteriore, presenza di osteocondrosi, curettage degli spazi intervertebrali, sede del prolasso.Nel tempo di osservazione (1957â€“1965) la durata della degenza postoperatoria ebbe tendenza alla riduzione. Degenze piÃ¹ lunghe si ebbero dopo laminectomie in pazienti con ernie mediali, in anziani, in donne e ancora in pazienti assicurati. Fattori accorcianti la durata della degenza furono la localizzazione laterale dell'ernia discale, il sesso maschile e la non appartenenza alle assicurazioni sociali.ResumenEn 678 casos tratados quirurgicamente debido a hernia discal lumbar fueron analizados estadisticamente aquellos factores que posiblemente tuvieron influjo sobre la duraciÃ³n del tratamiento postoperatorio hospitalario.NingÃºn influjo tuvioron los siguientes factores: DuraciÃ³n de la anamnesis, estado civil, nacionalidad, perforaciÃ³n del ligamento longitudinal posterior por el prolapso, presencia de osteocondrose, curetaje del espacio intervertebral, localizaciÃ³n alta del prolapso.Durante el periodo de observaciÃ³n (1957â€“1965) la duraciÃ³n de la estancia en clÃ­nica mostrÃ³ una tendencia a disminuir.

Optimal Two-Step Prediction in Regression,"High-dimensional prediction typically comprises variable selection followed by least-squares refitting on the selected variables. However, the standard variable selection procedures, such as the lasso and thresholded ridge regression, hinge on tuning parameters that need to be calibrated. Cross-validation, the most popular calibration scheme, is computationally costly and does not provide theoretical guarantees for high-dimensional prediction. In this paper, we introduce an alternative scheme that is computationally more efficient than cross-validation and, in addition, provides optimal finite sample guarantees. While our scheme allows for a range of variable selection procedures, we provide explicit numerical and theoretical results for least-squares refitting on variables selected by the lasso and by thresholded ridge regression. These results demonstrate that our calibration scheme can outperform cross-validation in terms of speed, accuracy, and theoretical guarantees.",2014,arXiv: Methodology
[Therapeutic possibilities of venolymphatic disorders using thalassotherapy].,"Venolymphatic pathology of the lower extremities represents a major part of the recruiting of a specialized thalassotherapy center, such as ""Les Cures Marines de Trouville"". The various treatments are adjusted according to each clinical case. The main techniques which are prescribed, include alternatively: active rehabilitation in sea-water pool at 34 degrees C; underwater showers and manual massages of the connective tissue; shower sprays; microbubbles; algi baths. The temperature of the baths and showers ranges between 32 and 35 degrees C. An example of the treatments administered in Trouville consists in underwater lymphatic drainage, performed by the physical therapist in a large tank, at minimum pressure. It begins with a symmetrical drainage of the trunk (or basic protocol), then drainage of the lymphedema, always starting at the root of the limb. Hygiene-dietetic rules are discussed in detail during the consultation. A fitted elastic bandage is prescribed at the end of the treatment.",1988,Phlebologie
EM-type algorithms for non-convex and high-dimensional problems,"Todayâ€™s trend is to analyse high-dimensional datasets through convex optimization. A famous example is the Lasso for estimation and variable selection in the high-dimensional regression model. Another currently very popular example is the so-called matrix completion problem, where the goal is to recover missing entries in large low-rank matrices by solving a simple convex optimization program. The main advantages of convex problems are that they can be numerically solved very efficiently and that they have a unique solution which can be mathematically analysed using powerful tools from convex analysis. Despite the advantages of convex optimization problems, we believe that convex functions are often too limited to take into account the complex structure present in real data applications. In this thesis, we therefore move on and use more advanced and flexible modelling techniques to describe high-dimensional data. The resulting optimization problems are very challenging, far from being convex and may have several optimal solutions. However, we demonstrate that in a sparse context, where only a small number of the model parameters are nonzero, it is possible to solve such problems very efficiently. Furthermore, we will also show on real datasets that there is a considerable gain in terms of statistical performance over convex methods. In a first project, Chapter 2 in this thesis, we extend estimation and variable selection in a high-dimensional setup to a finite mixture of regressions (FMR) model, which can deal with a heterogeneous population consisting of different unknown subgroups. We propose a penalized maximum likelihood estimator using a novel parameterization, analyse its asymptotic properties and derive oracle inequalities. From a compu-",2010,
Il governo locale in Italia. Dallâ€™UnitÃ  al Fascismo,"Lâ€™amministrazione pubblica si muove sul lungo periodo e procede con ritmi ripetitivi: conserva a lungo regole organizzative e mentalita burocratiche, si fonda e vive di procedure operative consolidate. Assetti istituzionali di epoche precedenti si mantengono nonostante i cambiamenti di regime e le filosofie politiche che si scontrano con la poco appariscente ma tenace forza della prassi. Traiettoria questa piu o meno comune a tutte le pubbliche amministrazioni ma caratteristica per molti motivi dellâ€™ordinamento amministrativo italiano dalla sua costituzione fino al sistema repubblicano. Una caratteristica che ancor piu appare evidente nellâ€™evoluzione del modello accentrato per lâ€™ordinamento amministrativo italiano, che appare strettamente omogenea con il suo impianto costituzionale. Tale omogeneita era data dalla forma di governo in cui si esplicitava la cosiddetta costituzione materiale che reggeva il Regno dâ€™Italia. Un sistema nel quale gli eventi risorgimentali e la prassi parlamentare affermarono una interpretazione evolutiva e di governo parlamentare per il sistema politico-costituzionale del Regno, che, pur con qualche limite, differiva da quella formalmente prevista dallo Statuto Albertino. I Presidenti del Consiglio, necessitando della fiducia del Parlamento e non quindi di quella del Re, avevano bisogno, vista lâ€™assenza di un moderno sistema di partiti, del consenso individuale, o almeno dei principali gruppi, politici e territoriali, dai quali lâ€™assemblea era costituita. Cio era la naturale evoluzione del funzionamento dellâ€™istituto della rappresentanza politica basata su un suffragio concesso solo allâ€™1.9% della popolazione, un sistema elettorale uninominale â€“ maggioritario accompagnato dalla mancanza di partiti radicati su base nazionale. La necessita del governo centrale di acquisire il consenso dei deputati produceva accordi di natura essenzialmente clientelare, generando quel cattivo funzionamento del meccanismo che produsse, sul versante parlamentare, il trasformismo, su quello amministrativo locale la disponibilita dellâ€™esecutivo di far giungere in periferia risorse materiali e finanziarie in cambio della fiducia concessa dai singoli deputati. In questo tipo di sistema entrava anche lâ€™elettore, che poteva contare non perche aveva un rappresentante, ma se attraverso il rappresentante poteva attivare a suo favore la macchina amministrativa, la burocrazia. A cio bisogna aggiungere che lo Stato prodotto dal Risorgimento pur rappresentando un profondo rivolgimento socio-culturale, modificando in modo sensibile il contesto politico-istituzionale, manco, con la vittoria del partito liberal-moderato, di una vera e propria pars destruens a livello di classi egemoni centrali e locali. Di certo una struttura amministrativa â€œriservataâ€, discrezionale, insieme ad una combinazione di localismo elettorale e di centralismo amministrativo influi sulla nascente cultura politica della comunita nazionale, fissandone uno dei parametri costanti: il rapporto politico come rapporto di scambio. Il perfetto controllo dellâ€™amministrazione centrale serviva quindi per garantire questo equilibrio: il deputato diveniva tutore presso il centro degli interessi della sua zona territoriale dâ€™influenza, espressione di un notabilato con interessi ben radicati. Vi era quindi un flusso ininterrotto, di alterna direzione, di istanze, richieste, concessioni, piaceri, contropartite, deroghe e baratti di ogni genere, e non sempre di comprovata liceita. Tra lâ€™universo centrale e quello periferico vi erano delle linee trasversali che finivano per cementare la dipendenza dellâ€™uno dallâ€™altro. Il deputato, forte del peso politico del suo voto in Parlamento, poteva intervenire sui prefetti per far punire sindaci e amministratori locali in mano a forze politiche avverse, potevano ben spingere verso lâ€™allontanamento di un prefetto troppo zelante, cosi come gli amministratori locali erano in grado di frustrare le aspettative di rielezione di un onorevole attraverso lâ€™influenza che potevano avere sulle poche unita di elettori locali sulle quali esercitavano un facile controllo. Questo â€œcircolo viziosoâ€ trovava espressione diretta nelle Deputazioni provinciali, delle quali, attraverso la regola del â€œcumulo dei mandatiâ€, facevano spesso parte esponenti parlamentari. Lâ€™alternativa delle autonomie non sarebbe stata realisticamente praticabile perche avrebbe rappresentato un cuneo posto nei gangli della ben oliata macchina dellâ€™amministrazione â€œgeneraleâ€ dello Stato. Una precisa ragione strutturale che ha ritardato, se non impedito, uno sviluppo democratico del sistema politico o quantomeno una evoluzione autonomistica dei poteri locali. Dunque la scelta di spiegare la deriva accentratrice del neonato Stato unitario, sembra non poter essere giustificata dalla inderogabile necessita, per la ristretta elite dominante, di garantire lâ€™unita del Paese che si stava faticosamente conquistando. Cio infatti non servirebbe a spiegare la perdurante continuita della scelta accentratrice. La spinta iniziale allâ€™accentramento, dovuta allâ€™instabilita del neonato sistema, puo anche essere vista come un motivo piu che valido per operare una scelta simile. Ma quando le circostanze critiche iniziali vennero meno, ed il rischio di un collasso e di una disgregazione dello Stato erano meno incombenti, la conferma di tale scelta non puo essere spiegata se non si riconosce una precisa volonta dei ceti dominanti, sia centrali che locali, di mantenere la loro egemonia politica, sociale ed economica sulle classi subalterne e di impedire loro di partecipare alle gestione della cosa pubblica non solo in Parlamento, e quindi al livello centrale, ma anche sul piano delle autonomie locali. Appare evidente quindi che quel sistema politico e quel modello amministrativo, furono il frutto di precise scelte istituzionali e di consapevoli opzioni legislative, accelerate magari da situazioni politiche, sociali ed economiche contingenti, ma non dettate da esse. E quel sistema gratifico talmente bene le aspettative di chi lo aveva creato, ed in genere di chi deteneva il potere esecutivo, da poter godere di una lunga durata.",2006,
Prediction-Oriented Marker Selection (PROMISE): With Application to High-Dimensional Regression,"In personalized medicine, biomarkers are used to select therapies with the highest likelihood of success based on an individual patientâ€™s biomarker/genomic profile. Two goals are to choose important biomarkers that accurately predict treatment outcomes and to cull unimportant biomarkers to reduce the cost of biological and clinical verifications. These goals are challenging due to the high dimensionality of genomic data. Variable selection methods based on penalized regression (e.g., the lasso and elastic net) have yielded promising results. However, selecting the right amount of penalization is critical to simultaneously achieving these two goals. Standard approaches based on cross-validation (CV) typically provide high prediction accuracy with high true positive rates (TPRs) but at the cost of too many false positives. Alternatively, stability selection (SS) controls the number of false positives, but at the cost of yielding too few true positives. To circumvent these issues, we propose prediction-oriented marker selection (PROMISE), which combines SS with CV to conflate the advantages of both methods. Our application of PROMISE with the lasso and elastic net in data analysis shows that, compared to CV, PROMISE produces sparse solutions, few false positives, and small type IÂ +Â type II error, and maintains good prediction accuracy, with a marginal decrease in the TPRs. Compared to SS, PROMISE offers better prediction accuracy and TPRs. In summary, PROMISE can be applied in many fields to select regularization parameters when the goals are to minimize false positives and maximize prediction accuracy.",2017,Statistics in Biosciences
Ridge and Lasso Regression Models for Cross-Version Defect Prediction,"Sorting software modules in order of defect count can help testers to focus on software modules with more defects. One of the most popular methods for sorting modules is generalized linear regression. However, our previous study showed the poor performance of these regression models, which might be caused by severe multicollinearity. Ridge regression (RR) can improve the prediction performance for multicollinearity problems. Lasso regression (LAR) is a worthy competitor to RR. Therefore, we investigate both RR and LAR models for cross-version defect prediction. Cross-version defect prediction is an approximate to real applications. It constructs prediction models from a previous version of projects and predicts defects in the next version. Experimental results based on 11 projects from the PROMISE repository consisting of 41 different versions show that: 1) there exist severe multicollinearity problems in the experimental datasets; 2) both RR and LAR models perform better than linear regression and negative binomial regression for cross-version defect prediction; and 3) compared with two best methods in our previous study for sorting software modules according to the predicted number of defects, RR has comparable performance and less model construction time.",2018,IEEE Transactions on Reliability
PO-073 Small non-coding RNA in serum from testicular germ cell tumour patientsidentified by machine learning,"Introduction Testicular germ cell tumour (TGCT) is a malignancy present in males with the highest incidence rates in younger age ranges. The aetiology is still largely unknown; however, several genome-wide association studies have identified up to 30 independent loci influencing TGCT risk, confirming its inherited genetic susceptibility. Machine learning can be utilised as a modelling technique to identify patterns within genetic and lifestyle data that allows classification and identification of biomarkers. We aim to identify potential biomarkers and perform accurate classifications in the small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) of 147 pre-diagnostic serum samples. Material and methods The serum samples were obtained from the Janus Serum Bank, with life-style covariates, such as smoking habits, BMI and exercise habits also recorded for each sample. A total of 69 TGCT samples and 78 control sample sncRNA reads were used to train machine learning algorithms including linear regression, LASSO, decision trees and neural networks. These cases and controls are matched by age at blood sampling. Results and discussions Preliminary results from LASSO and decision tree methods show differentiation in the miRNA/piRNA patterns between the control and the TGCT samples after adjusting individual read counts for age at sampling. Classification performance was better when trained using piRNAs, 58% of control samples were classified as normal and 60% of TGCT cases being classified as TGCT patients. Further inclusion of life-style covariates in the model as well as age and time of diagnosis is still to be performed to increase classification performance further. By using interpretable machine learning methods, we aim to identify biomarkers that allow the accurate classification of the samples. Conclusion These results show that the piRNA composition seen in pre-diagnostic serum samples may contain potential biomarkers that can lead to accurate classification of whether a patient was at increased risk of testicular cancer before the initial diagnosis. Preliminary results should be further expanded with different sncRNA datasets and lifestyle covariates.",2018,
"Paleoenvironmental reconstruction based on palynological and palynofacies analyses of the Aptian-Albian succession in the Sergipe Basin, northeastern Brazil","Palynological and palynofacies analyses were carried out on samples from two wells in the Sergipe Basin with the aim of reconstruction the paleoenvironments of the upper Aptian-middle Albian interval. Altogether 19 species of spores, 31 species of pollen grains, 20 species of dinocysts were identified. Moreover, one genus of Acritarcha and one genus of fresh-water algae were recorded. The sections are clearly dominated by the pollen group, in particular gymnosperms, which is by far the most abundant group in the two wells studied. In well GTP-17-SE the second most abundant group is the spores. Well GTP-24-SE is characterized by high abundance of marine. One zone and two sub-zones and one zone of middle Albian were recognized. The absence of the three sub-zones and one zone of the uppermost Aptian to lower middle Albian indicates a possible hiatus. Four clusters, which represent different palynological assemblages. The stratigraphic distribution of these Four assemblages allowed the definition of seven ecophases. The relative abundance of spores and the genus Classopollis indicates for a predominantly arid paleoclimate. However, these conditions tend to decrease upwards in sequence, changing to tropical climates. The stratigraphic distribution of palynofacies associations that defined eight palynofacies units in well GTP-17-SE and ten in well GTP-24-SE reflects a continuous terrestrial influx throughout the succession. The increase in abundance of amorphous organic matter (AOM) and palynomorph groups indicates a transgression or a decreasing terrestrial influx. The palynological and palynofacies analyses of the successions studied allowed detailed environmental reconstruction. Six depositional environments were recognized: a brackish lagoonal; lagoonal coastal plain environment; intertidal-nearshore, shallow-neritic shallow marine and middle-neritic. The paleoenvironmental evolution reflects the progressively increasing marine influence into the area.",2001,
MPGL: An Efficient Matching Pursuit Method for Generalized LASSO,"Unlike traditional LASSO enforcing sparsity on the variables, Generalized LASSO (GL) enforces sparsity on a linear transformation of the variables, gaining flexibility and success in many applications. However, many existing GL algorithms do not scale up to high-dimensional problems, and/or only work well for a specific choice of the transformation. We propose an efficient Matching Pursuit Generalized LASSO (MPGL) method, which overcomes these issues, and is guaranteed to converge to a global optimum. We formulate the GL problem as a convex quadratic constrained linear programming (QCLP) problem and tailor-make a cutting plane method. More specifically, our MPGL iteratively activates a subset of nonzero elements of the transformed variables, and solves a subproblem involving only the activated elements thus gaining significant speed-up. Moreover, MPGL is less sensitive to the choice of the trade-off hyper-parameter between data fitting and regularization, and mitigates the longstanding hyper-parameter tuning issue in many existing methods. Experiments demonstrate the superior efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method over the state-of-the-arts in both classification and image processing tasks. Introduction Learning with sparsity-inducing norms has gained much success in many applications including medical data analysis (Tibshirani and Wang 2008), image processing (Rudin, Osher, and Fatemi 1992), feature selection (Tan, Tsang, and Wang 2014) and so on. One efficient way to enforce sparsity on the variables is to use the `1-norm as LASSO (Tibshirani 1996) instead of the `0-norm. Since then, many methods have been proposed to enforce some additional constraints (Huang, Zhang, and Metaxas 2011; Kim and Xing 2010; Tibshirani et al. 2011) to improve the results. A group of methods among them is called generalized LASSO (Tibshirani et al. 2011), which promotes the sparsity of the variables after a linear transformation (Liu, Yuan, and Ye 2013) instead of the variables themselves. The choice of such a transformation represents the property of the variables to be desired, and often depends on the application. Generalized LASSO.

Breast Cancer Progression Modeling Using Static Sample Data ( Supplementary Data ),"Mathematically, a cancer progression trajectory can be viewed as a complex manifold with a branching structure embedded in a high-dimensional genomic space. Since only a small fraction of genes may involve in tumor growth and spread, the first step is to identify cancer progression related genes supporting a complex manifold. This problem has been extensively studied in both the statistics and oncology communities in different contexts. One of the most commonly used approaches is correlation analysis. A gene with its expression levels highly correlated with patient survival time is likely to play a role in cancer development. However, correlation analysis can only find genes with linear dependency with survival time. Moreover, by analyzing one gene at a time, correlation analysis ignores possible interactions among genes. In molecular classification, a commonly used approach is to first partition patients into a bad or good prognostic group at a predefined end point (usually 5-years survival or time to metastasis) and then perform feature selection for classification analysis [1]. A major drawback of this approach is that patients with survival time slightly larger or smaller than the end point will be put into two different groups. In order to explore the magnitude information of response variables, we propose to address the problem of selecting cancer progression related genes within the regression framework. The idea is not new, and has been widely used in the statistics and oncology community. There are a number of excellent algorithms exemplified by Lasso [2] and its variants [3, 4] that operate under a linear-model assumption. However, the dependency between gene expression changes and disease progression is unlikely to be linear. Recent results have shown that cancer progression processes can be complicated and can be represented by a phylogenetic tree-like structure [5]. We develop a new feature-selection algorithm for nonlinear regression. The basic idea is to decompose a nonlinear regression problem into a set of linear classification problems and learn the feature relevance within a large-margin framework. It is built logically based on our previous work on feature selection for high-dimensional classification problems [6]. We first develop a new approach to estimating sample responses and prediction errors. We then use a feature weighting strategy to find a feature subspace where an error function is minimized. We formulate it as an optimization problem with a well-defined objective function within the SVM framework, and solve it using an iterative approach. In",2014,
Relation between pulmonary vein firing and extent of left atrial-pulmonary vein connection in patients with atrial fibrillation.,"BACKGROUND
The purpose of this study was to measure the extent of left atrial-pulmonary vein (LA-PV) connections and determine the relation to PV firing in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF).


METHODS AND RESULTS
Ten close-bipolar (1 mm-spacing) Lasso electrograms were recorded circumferentially around 210 PVs (excluding 2 right middle PVs and 4 left common trunks) in 62 patients with AF. PV firing was provoked by isoproterenol (4 microg/min) and cardioversion of pacing-induced AF. The width of each LA-PV connection was measured in tenths of PV circumference, based on number of continuous close-bipolar Lasso electrode sites required for ablation (10% for each close-bipolar electrode site). One, 2, or 3 to 4 discrete LA-PV connections (discrete connection defined by ablation along 10% to 30% of PV circumference) were present in 18 (9%), 31 (14%), and 32 (15%) of 210 PVs, respectively: 1 broad connection (ablation along continuous 40% to 80% circumference) in 46 (22%) PVs; 1 broad plus other broad or discrete connections in 54 (26%) PVs; and a circumferential connection (ablation along 90% to 100%) in 29 (14%) PVs. Circumferential LA-PV connections were more common in superior than in inferior PVs (20% versus 7%, P<0.01). There was no major difference in distribution of the other types of LA-PV connections between the four PVs. PV firing occurred in 27%, 47%, and 72% of PVs with discrete only, broad and circumferential connections, respectively (P<0.01). Dissociated PV potentials after isolation were more common in arrhythmogenic (firing) PVs (32% versus 8%, P<0.01).


CONCLUSIONS
The extent of LA-PV connections corresponds with arrhythmognesis. The incidence of PV firing increases with progressively wider LA-PV connections (discrete versus broad versus circumferential).",2004,Circulation
Partikelaufnahme in der HÃ¼hnerlunge,"Der Aufnahmemechanismus, Weitertransport sowie Abbau von inhalierten Partikeln in der Vogellunge sind im Vergleich zur Saugerlunge weitgehend unverstanden. Dies liegt zum einen an den anatomischen Unterschieden und zum anderen an der geringeren Verfugbarkeit spezifischer Marker, insbesondere fur aviare antigenprasentierende Zellen. Von bestimmten Bereichen der Vogellunge, wie dem follikelassoziierten Epithel (FAE) des Bronchus-assoziierten lymphatischen Gewebes (BALT) oder den Atrienepithelien, wird die Fahigkeit zur Phagozytose angenommen. Umfassende histologische Untersuchungen zur Partikelaufnahme, die dies belegen, sind jedoch nicht vorhanden. Diese Arbeit setzt sich anhand von unterschiedlichen histologischen Techniken umfassend mit der Partikelaufnahme in der Huhnerlunge auseinander. Die Versuche stellen eine histologische Annaherung an das Thema Partikelaufnahme in der Vogellunge dar und dienen als Grundlage fur die Etablierung von geeigneten in vivo-Versuchs-modellen fur die histologische Analyse. Aus diesem Grund â€“ und insbesondere aus Tierschutzgrunden â€“ wurde die Applikation in Anlehnung an beschriebene Infektionsversuche kurze Zeit post mortem durchgefuhrt. Um die Heterogenitat der Partikel in der Stallluft abzubilden, wurden unterschiedliche Partikel tracheal appliziert (Tusche, Latex-Beads, Fluoresceinisothiocyanat, Neutralrot, E. coli). Die Vitalitat des Gewebes wurde anhand von Vitalitatsfarbungen bestatigt. 
Die Ergebnisse dieser Arbeit zeigen deutlich, dass alle eingegebenen Partikel sowie E. coli-Bakterien durch das Atrienepithel aufgenommen werden und belegen damit dessen postulierte Phagozytosefahigkeit. Entgegen den Forschungs-ergebnissen beim Sauger ist im Bereich des FAE des Huhner-BALT nur eine geringe Aufnahmekapazitat fur Tusche und Beads darstellbar, wohingegen FITC (Fluoresceinisothiocyanat) effektiv durch das gesamte FAE aufgenommen wird. Hinweise zum Abtransport der Partikel lassen sich aus den histologischen Befunden ableiten. Sowohl Tusche als auch Beads sind vermehrt in den interparabronchialen Septen und teilweise in der Nahe extrabronchialer germinaler Zentren (GCs) sowie den Blutgefasen darstellbar. In den GCs alterer Tiere finden sich regelmasig Partikelablagerungen, die teilweise positiv mit dem anti Pan-Zytokeratin-Antikorper reagieren und Federstaub entsprechen konnen. Die GCs konnen somit einen Ablageort fur inhalierte Partikel darstellen, ahnlich wie dies bei Saugerlymphknoten beschrieben ist. Aufgrund dieser Ergebnisse und zum besseren Verstandnis der pulmonalen GCs wurde eine dreidimensionale Rekonstruktion der GCs erstellt. Diese zeigte, dass sich die GCs der Lunge von den typisch kugeligen Milz-GCs unterscheiden und an die strukturellen Besonder-heiten der Lunge angepasst sind. Neutralrot, Kohlenstoffpartikel aus der Tusche und Beads werden den Ergebnissen der Arbeit nach durch Makrophagen bzw. dendritische Zellen im Bereich der Atriensepten aufgenommen und somit moglicherweise zellular zu den Blutgefasen und interparabronchialen Septen transportiert. Die interparabronchialen Septen konnen eine lymphatische Drainage der Lunge darstellen, der Nachweis von Lymphendothelzellen gelang mit den zur Verfugung stehenden Antikorpern allerdings nicht. Allein FITC reichert sich in den Epithelien des Primarbronchus und der Atrien an und findet sich nur vereinzelt im Bindegewebe. Die Identifizierung der FITC-assoziierten Zellen gelang mit den derzeit verfugbaren Markern jedoch nicht. 
Die antigenspezifische Immunantwort wurde im Rahmen einer Impfung mit dem Newcastle Disease Virus durch Genexpressionsanalysen in Abhangigkeit der verschiedenen Kompartimente der Lunge (Primarbronchus, Parenchym, Trachea) und der Milz untersucht. Die konjunktivale Impfung fuhrt sowohl zu einer systemischen als auch pulmonalen Immunantwort in Form eines Anstiegs der B Zellen und des Enzyms AID (activation induced cytidine deaminase), das im Rahmen der germinalen Zentrumsreaktion exprimiert wird. Immunhisto-chemische Untersuchungen als Ansatz eines histologischen Verstandnisses der immunologischen Vorgange weisen hierbei sowohl auf eine Beteiligung des BALT (Anstieg der GC-Zahl) als auch auf eine schleimhautassoziierte Immunitat hin (Anstieg der IgA-Sekretion). 
Auf den hier etablierten Versuchsmodellen aufbauend, kann der Weg inhalierter Partikel durch in vivo-Studien gezielt analysiert und die Frage nach dem Abtransport aus der Lunge nach Aufnahme durch das Atrienepithel bzw. das FAE weiterverfolgt werden.",2018,
A SAEM algorithm for fused lasso penalized NonLinear Mixed Effect Models: Application to group comparison in pharmacokinetics,Nonlinear mixed effect models are classical tools to analyze nonlinear longitudinal data in many fields such as population pharmacokinetics. Groups of observations are usually compared by introducing the group affiliations as binary covariates with a reference group that is stated among the groups. This approach is relatively limited as it allows only the comparison of the reference group to the others. The proposed method compares groups using a penalized likelihood approach. Groups are described by the same structural model but with parameters that are group specific. The likelihood is penalized with a fused lasso penalty that induces sparsity in the differences between groups for both fixed effects and variances of random effects. A penalized Stochastic Approximation EM algorithm is proposed that is coupled to Alternating Direction Method Multipliers to solve the maximization step. An extensive simulation study illustrates the performance of this algorithm when comparing more than two groups. Then the approach is applied to real data from two pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction trials.,2016,Comput. Stat. Data Anal.
How can we map stories? A cybercartographic application for narrative cartography,"Narratives and places are deeply connected. Places often contribute to the shaping of a story, just as stories contribute to the production of spatial identities. Mapping narratives can thus have a double goal: to explore the geographic structure of a story, and to better understand the impact of stories on the production of places. While it may be easy to locate narratives as points on a map, this type of representation is rarely relevant in capturing and characterising the complex spatio-temporal dimensions of the narratives. In this paper, we present a cyber-cartographic application designed to address this issue and provide solutions to help properly map some of the many dimensions of narratives, including the places of the narration (geography), the connection between these places (geometry), as well as the temporal dimension inherent to storytelling. This application, originally developed to map contemporary Canadian cinematographic narratives (see examples here: http://scaquard.classone-tech.com/),...",2014,Journal of Maps
"Genomic prediction and GWAS of yield, quality and disease-related traits in spring barley and winter wheat","Genome-wide association study (GWAS) and genomic prediction (GP) are extensively employed to accelerate genetic gain and identify QTL in plant breeding. In this study, 1,317 spring barley and 1,325 winter wheat breeding lines from a commercial breeding program were genotyped with the Illumina 9â€‰K barley or 15â€‰K wheat SNP-chip, and phenotyped in multiple years and locations. For GWAS, in spring barley, a QTL on chr. 4H associated with powdery mildew and ramularia resistance were found. There were several SNPs on chr. 4H showing genome-wide significance with yield traits. In winter wheat, GWAS identified two SNPs on chr. 6A, and one SNP on chr. 1B, significantly associated with quality trait moisture, as well as one SNP located on chr. 5B associated with starch content in the seeds. The significant SNPs identified by multiple trait GWAS were generally the same as those found in single trait GWAS. GWAS including genotype-location information in the model identified significant SNPs in each tested location, which were not found previously when including all locations in the GWAS. For GP, in spring barley, GP using the Bayesian Power Lasso model had higher accuracy than ridge regression BLUP in powdery mildew and yield traits, whereas the prediction accuracies were similar using Bayesian Power Lasso model and rrBLUP for yield traits in winter wheat.",2020,Scientific Reports
Gravitational collapse of a shell subject to the Casimir force,"SummaryThe gravitational collapse of a spherical conducting shell subject to the repulsive Casimir force is considered. The question of whether the Casimir effect can prevent the collapse of the shell down to zero radius is raised with particular reference to the previous work on this topic done by Brevik and Kolbenstvedt. In contrast to this earlier treatment, the simplest consistent model exhibits features similar to the charged-shell case. In such a model, the Casimir force is unable to arrest the collapse if the shellâ€™s mass exceeds a microscopic value.RiassuntoSi considera il collasso gravitazionale di uno strato sferico conducente soggetto alla forza di repulsione di Casimir.

Hardwood-redcedar clusters in the post oak savanna of Texas,"Hardwood-redcedar clusters occur when several redcedars (Juniperus virginiana) germinate and grow beneath the canopy of a single live hardwood tree. Of 187 redcedars observed in 12 clusters, 92% occurred within four m of the cluster center. Redcedar numbers ranged from 6 to 28 per cluster (16 Â± 7 (x Â± SD)). When the 12 clusters were divided into two types based on the presence (n = 7) or absence (n = 5) of a live post oak center tree, clusters without a live center tree had redcedar with greater height (6.28 Â± 2.13 vs 3.87 Â± 1.59 m) and greater redcedar dispersion (average distance of redcedars from cluster center: 2.57 Â± 1.50 vs 1.95 Â± 1.02 m). Clusters are common in the post oak savanna region, and appear to occur in high density patches following the co-occurrence of hardwoods and redcedars. The vegetation dynamics of clusters is unknown. Eastern redcedar and other juniper species often germinate in large number and grow beneath the canopy of hardwoods (Phillips, 1910; Parker, 1951) and pines (Phillips, 1910). This pattern has most often been attributed to seed deposition by birds (Phillips, 1910; Parker, 1951; Bard, 1952; Livingston, 1972). However, the formation of a cluster of redcedar beneath single hardwoods has been little studied and there are no published descriptions of the vegetation structure of such clusters. Ormsbee et al. (1976) described eastern redcedar as an early successional species adapted for growth in open areas. They concluded from photosynthetic measurements that redcedar is excluded from mature forests because it is shade-intolerant. However, Lassoie et al. (1983) reported that redcedar persisted as an understory component of oak-hickory forest in Missouri due to physiological adaptation to shaded conditions. Their measurements indicated that photosynthetic rates were highest in spring and autumn. They suggested that the persistence of redcedar could be explained by favorable growth conditions occurring when hardwoods were defoliated. Therefore, shading per se may not exclude redcedar as a vegetation component. The purpose of this report is to document the existence of hardwoodredcedar clusters and to describe the physical structure of clusters located in the post oak savanna region of Texas. STUDY AREA-The study site of about 16 ha is located within the 485 ha Native Plant and Animal Conservancy in College Station owned by Texas A&M University. The vegetation of the study site is typical of the post oak savanna (or claypan) region in east-central Texas (Gould, 1975). The dominant hardwood is post oak (Quercus stellata), and the landscape is a mosaic of small grassland areas, post oak-dominated woodland patches, and post oak-yaupon (Ilex vomitoria) thickets. METHODS-Clusters were defined by the canopy of a single hardwood tree, or by an isolated grouping of redcedars. In the 12 clusters measured, 7 had a live post oak center tree.

"Stenorhynchosaurus munozi, gen. et sp. nov. a new pliosaurid from the Upper Barremian (Lower Cretaceous) of Villa de Leiva, Colombia, South America","From one of the most complete Lower Cretaceous rock sequences in the world (in Villa de Leiva region,Â central Colombia), we describe a new genus and species of pliosaurid plesiosaur Stenorhynchosaurus munozi.Â Stenorhynchosaurus displays a series of features which differentiate it from all the other Cretaceous pliosauridÂ genera: the anterior of the vomer, in ventral view, posterior of the palatal premaxilla-maxilla suture, contacting theÂ posterior palatal process of the premaxilla level with the third maxillary alveolus; rostrum narrow and elongatedÂ with straight sides in dorsal view; lacrimal forming the anterior border and greater part of the ventral border ofÂ the orbit and broadly borders the maxilla anteriorly; anterior interpterygoid vacuity present; internal nares locatedÂ between vomer and maxilla at the level of 13th-15th maxillary alveoli; anterior of rostrum and mandible withoutÂ lateral expansion or marked increase in size of the functional alveoli; penultimate premaxillary alveolus slightlyÂ larger than adjacent premaxillary alveoli; homodont maxillary functional alveoli, with fourth tooth positions veryÂ slightly enlarged with respect to the neighboring alveoli; homodont dentary dentition; and epipodials extremelyÂ short. Based on morphological analysis of phylogenetic characters, Stenorhynchosaurus most likely nests within theÂ increasingly inclusive Pliosauridae and Pliosauroidea, however, as currently defined, firm inference for referral ofÂ Stenorhynchosaurus to Thalassophonea is much more problematic, but ultimately seems likely based on charactersÂ shared with Pliosaurus and Brachaucheninae. However, this uncertainty indicates Thalassophonea requires rigorousÂ redefinition. As to whether Stenorhynchosaurus is a member of the currently exclusively Jurassic genus Pliosaurus,Â or the Cretaceous sub-family Brachaucheninae, remains equivocal.Â  Â© 2016. Acad. Colomb. Cienc.

Cities of the Sea: Constantinopleâ€”Mobility and Cosmopolitanism,"The sea was connected with the classical idea of unstable fortune and the more recent implications of mercantile cosmopolitanism in the Elizabethansâ€™ and Jacobeansâ€™ minds. Discussing the cultural meanings of the maritime world in early modern English literature, Steve Mentz makes the case for â€œa blue cultural studies,â€ by which he refers to explorations of the maritime discourses that can change interpretations of literature. Mentzâ€™s approach is integrated in the broader concept of â€œnew thalassology,â€ devised by Nicholas Horden and Peregrine Purcell and intended to revitalize Mediterranean history.1 My primary concern is to use the sea environment to reconsider paradigms of early modern globalization as revealed through dramatic representations of sea cities. I will explore the theatrical inflections of the cultures of communities influenced by the sea as inspired by geographic narratives describing a strategically located city of the seaâ€”Constantinople.2 Early modern English drama placed the meanings of the sea in the context of the massive ocean-bound expansion of European culture that began in the fifteenth century, but mainly in the old world of the Mediterranean that generated that culture. The seaâ€™s ancient meanings shifted in the early modern period as geographic experience and knowledge increased.",2015,
"[Feasibility and results of at-home follow-up after early postpartum discharge from maternity units in Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso].","OBJECTIVE
to describe the feasibility and results of at-home follow-up of mothers and newborns discharged early from the maternity ward after normal childbirth.


METHOD
This prospective descriptive study took place during a one month period (April 1-30, 2011) in five maternity units in Bobo-Dioulasso, the second largest city in Burkina Faso. Mothers with normal vaginal deliveries and no complications at the sixth hour postpartum were included in the study with their newborns after informed oral consent. The discharge took place between 12 and 48 hours after delivery. The follow-up took place by telephone, home visits, and emergency hospital visits in cases of complications. A postnatal hospital visit was systematically planned for day 7.


RESULTS
The study included 630 mothers and their babies. There were 1567 phone calls made: 27 women could not be reached by telephone after discharge, and 140 home visits took place, either at the mother's request or because of the failure to reach her by telephone. Complications were observed in 55 mothers and 135 babies.


CONCLUSION
Postnatal follow-up at home is required for mothers and their newborns discharged early from the maternity ward after normal childbirth in view of the possibility of complications. This ensures continuity of care to improve survival of mothers and babies. As cell phones become more and more available, they may play an important role as a tool for such follow up.",2014,Medecine et sante tropicales
Post-selection inference for l 1-penalized likelihood models Presenter :,"According to the article[2], we present a new method for post-selection inference for l1(lasso)penalized likelihood models, including generalized regression models. Our approach generalizes the post-selection framework presented in Lee et al. (2013)[1]. The method provides P-values and confidence intervals that are asymptotically valid, conditional on the inherent selection done by the lasso. We present applications of this work to (regularized) logistic regression, Coxâ€™s proportional hazards model, and the graphical lasso. We do not provide rigorous proofs here of the claimed results, but rather conceptual and theoretical sketches.",2017,
Is Feature Selection Secure against Training Data Poisoning?,"Learning in adversarial settings is becoming an important task for application domains where attackers may inject malicious data into the training set to subvert normal operation of data-driven technologies. Feature selection has been widely used in machine learning for security applications to improve generalization and computational efficiency, although it is not clear whether its use may be beneficial or even counterproductive when training data are poisoned by intelligent attackers. In this work, we shed light on this issue by providing a framework to investigate the robustness of popular feature selection methods, including LASSO, ridge regression and the elastic net. Our results on malware detection show that feature selection methods can be significantly compromised under attack (we can reduce LASSO to almost random choices of feature sets by careful insertion of less than 5% poisoned training samples), highlighting the need for specific countermeasures.",2015,
Sparse Spikes Deconvolution on Thin Grids,"This article analyzes the recovery performance of two popular finite dimensional approximations of the sparse spikes deconvolution problem over Radon measures. We examine in a unified framework both the L1 regularization (often referred to as Lasso or Basis-Pursuit) and the Continuous Basis-Pursuit (C-BP) methods. The Lasso is the de-facto standard for the sparse regularization of inverse problems in imaging. It performs a nearest neighbor interpolation of the spikes locations on the sampling grid. The C-BP method, introduced by Ekanadham, Tranchina and Simoncelli, uses a linear interpolation of the locations to perform a better approximation of the infinite-dimensional optimization problem, for positive measures. We show that, in the small noise regime, both methods estimate twice the number of spikes as the number of original spikes. Indeed, we show that they both detect two neighboring spikes around the locations of an original spikes. These results for deconvolution problems are based on an abstract analysis of the so-called extended support of the solutions of L1-type problems (including as special cases the Lasso and C-BP for deconvolution), which are of an independent interest. They precisely characterize the support of the solutions when the noise is small and the regularization parameter is selected accordingly. We illustrate these findings to analyze for the first time the support instability of compressed sensing recovery when the number of measurements is below the critical limit (well documented in the literature) where the support is provably stable.",2015,ArXiv
Magnesium Deficiency,"SummaryThe many causes of clinical magnesium deficiency can be placed into 2 categories: diminished intake of magnesium, and enhanced losses of magnesium, either through the gastrointestinal tract or through the kidneys. Examples of the first category include alcoholism, starvation, anorexia due to neoplastic disease and/or chemotherapy. Examples of the second category include severe diarrhoeal states, gastrointestinal fistulae, malabsorption, diuretic therapy and gentamicin therapy. Estimates of the prevalence of clinical hypomagnesaemia range from 6 to 11% in hospitalised patients. Serum predictors of associated clinical magnesium depletion include hypokalaemia (42%), hyponatraemia (23%), hypophosphataemia (22%) and hypocalcaemia (20%).Experimental and clinical observations strongly support the view that magnesium and potassium are closely linked at the cellular level. Magnesium has been demonstrated to be important in cell energetics (Mg++-activated ATPase), in maintenance of the integrity of cell membranes, retardation of cell loss of potassium, as well as enhancing repletion of cell potassium. While translation of these experimental observations into clinical terms encompasses a wide spectrum of illnesses, there is special relevance in considering the role of magnesium in repletion and maintenance of cell potassium in 2 clinical instances: (a) patients treated with digitalis and diuretics; and (b) hypertensive patients. In these types of patients not only potassium but also magnesium should be administered together to avoid the problem of cell potassium depletion and refractory potassium repletion associated with coexisting and uncorrected magnesium depletion.RÃ©sumÃ©On peut classer en 2 catÃ©gories les causes de dÃ©ficit en magnÃ©sium: rÃ©duction de lâ€™apport et augmentation de lâ€™Ã©limination soit par le systÃ¨me gastro-intestinal soit par le rein. Dans la premiÃ¨re catÃ©gorie on trouve par exemple lâ€™alcoolisme, la dÃ©nutrition, lâ€™anorÃ©xie des maladies cancÃ©reuses et/ou de la chimiothÃ©rapie antinÃ©oplasique; dans la seconde catÃ©gorie on peut citer les diarrhÃ©es sÃ©vÃ¨res, les fistules gastrointestinales, les malabsorptions, les traitements diurÃ©tiques et la gentamycine. On estime la prÃ©valence des hypomagnÃ©sÃ©mies cliniquement dÃ©celables Ã  6 Ã  11% des malades hospitalisÃ©s. Sont associÃ©s dans 42% des cas une hypokaliÃ©mie, dans 23 Vo des cas une hyponatrÃ©mie, dans 22% des cas une hypophosphatÃ©mie et dans 20% des cas une hypocalcÃ©mie.Des donnÃ©es expÃ©rimentales et cliniques Ã©tayent lâ€™idÃ©e que magnÃ©sium et potassium sont Ã©troitement dÃ©pendants au niveau cellulaire. On a montrÃ© que le magnÃ©sium est important pour les mÃ©canismes Ã©nergÃ©tiques cellulaires (Mg + + activateur de lâ€™ATPase), pour le maintien de lâ€™intÃ©gritÃ© des membranes cellulaires, pour freiner la perte cellulaire en potassium et faciliter sa rÃ©plÃ©tion cellulaire. Lâ€™application de ces donnÃ©es en clinique couvre un large Ã©ventail de maladies mais il est dâ€™un intÃ©rÃªt particulier dâ€™insister sur le rÃ´le du magnÃ©sium dans le maintien dâ€™une kaliÃ©mie cellulaire normale dans 2 circonstances pathologiques: a) chez les malades traitÃ©s par des digitaliques et des diurÃ©tiques; b) chez les hypertendus. Chez ces malades, on doit veiller Ã  un apport correct, non seulement de potassium mais aussi de magnÃ©sium pour Ã©viter les problÃ¨mes de dÃ©plÃ©tion cellulaire en potassium et de rÃ©plÃ©tion rÃ©fractaire quand existe une hypomagnÃ©sÃ©mie concomitante.ZusammenfassungDie vielen Ursachen eines klinischen Magnesiummangels kÃ¶nnen in 2 Kategorien eingeteilt werden: verminderte Aufnahme von Magnesium und verstÃ¤rkter Verlust an Magnesium entweder Ã¼ber den Gastrointestinaltrakt oder durch die Nieren. Zu den Beispielen der ersten Kategorie zÃ¤hlen Alkoholismus, Hungern, Anorexie aufgrund neoplastischer Erkrankungen und/oder Chemotherapie. Zu den Beispielen der zweiten Kategorie gehÃ¶ren schwere Diarrhoen, gastrointestinale Fisteln, Malabsorption, diuretische Therapie und Gentamycin-Therapie. SchÃ¤tzungen Ã¼ber das Vorkommen von HypomagnesiÃ¤mie schwanken zwischen 6 und 11% bei hospitalisierten Patienten. Zu den SerumprÃ¤diktoren eines klinischen Magnesiummangels zÃ¤hlen HypokaliÃ¤mie (42%), HyponatriÃ¤mie (23%), HypophosphatÃ¤mie (22%) und HypokalzÃ¤mie (20%).Experimentelle und klinische Beobachtungen stÃ¼tzen die Ansicht, daÎ² Magnesium und Kalium auf dem Zellniveau eng miteinander verknÃ¼pft sind. Es wurde nachgewiesen, daÎ² Magnesium fÃ¼r die Energie der Zelle (Mg+ + -aktivierte ATPase), zur Erhaltung der IntegritÃ¤t der Zellmembrane, zur Retardierung von zellulÃ¤ren Kaliumverlusten und der zellulÃ¤ren KaliumauffÃ¼llung wichtig ist. WÃ¤hrend die Ãœbertragung dieser experimentellen Beobachtungen in klinische Begriffe ein weites Spektrum von Erkrankungen umfaÎ²t, ist die Bedeutung von Magnesium fÃ¼r die AuffÃ¼llung und Aufrechterhaltung des zellulÃ¤ren Kaliums in 2 klinischen FÃ¤llen klinisch besonders relevant: a) bei mit Digitalis und Diuretika behandelten Patienten und b) bei hypertonen Patienten. Bei diesen Patiententypen sollte nicht nur Kalium sondern gleichzeitig auch Magnesium gegeben werden, um das Problem eines zellulÃ¤ren Kaliumverlustes und eines mit gleichzeitig vorhandenem und nicht korrigiertem Magnesiummangel assoziierten refraktÃ¤ren Kaliummangels zu vermeiden.SommarioI numerosi casi di carenza di magnesio clinicamente rilevante possono essere suddivisi in 2 categorie: ridotto apporto di magnesio e aumentata perdita di magnesio, sia attraverso il tratto gastroenterico sia attraverso i reni. Nel primo gruppo ricordiamo situazioni quali lâ€™etilismo, il digiuno, lâ€™anoressia secondaria a neoplasia e/o alla chemioterapia. Nel secondo gruppo troviamo i gravi stati diarroici, le fistole gastroenteriche, il malassorbimento, la terapia diuretica e quella con gentamicina. Il tasso di incidenza di una ipomagnesiemia clinicamente rilevante va dal 6 allâ€™11% dei pazienti ospedalizzati. Tra gli indicatori plasmatici di unâ€™associata deplezione clinica di magnesio ricordiamo lâ€™ipopotassiemia (42%), lâ€™iponatremia (23%), lâ€™ipofosfatemia (22%) e lâ€™ipocalcemia (20%). Osservazioni sia cliniche sia sperimentali sostengono energicamente la tesi secondo la quale il magnesio ed il potassio sarebbero strettamente correlati a livello cellulare. â€˜E stata dimostrata lâ€™importanza del magnesio per i processi energelici della cellula (A TPasi Mg++ -dipendente), per il mantenimento deliâ€™integritÃ  delie membrane cellulari, per il rallentamento della perdita cellulare di potassio, cosÃ¬ come nel facilitare lâ€™accumulo di potassio nella cellula. Se da un lato la trasposizione in termini clinici di queste osservazioni sperimentali abbraccia un ampio spettro di malattie, Ã¨ dâ€™altra parte di particolare rilievo considerare il ruolo del magnesio nei processi di accumulo e di conservazione cellulare del potassio in due situazioni cliniche particolari: a) in pazienti in terapia con digitale e diuretici, e b) in pazienti ipertesi. In queste categorie di pazienti non si dovrebbe somministrare solo potassio, ma anche, simultaneamente, magnesio, per evitare il problema di un impoverimen-to cellulare di potassio e quello di una refrattaria replezione di potassio, associata ad una coesistente deplezione di magnesio non corretta.ResumenEs posible distribuir las numerosas causas de dÃ©ficit clÃ­nico de magnesio en 2 grupos: ingestion disminuida de magnesio, y mayores pÃ©rdidas de magnesio, ya sea por el tracto gastrointestinal o a travÃ©s de los riÃ±ones. Entre los ejemplos del primer grupo cabe citar el alcoholismo, la inaniciÃ³n y ta anorexia debida a los procesos neoplÃ¡sicos y/o quimioterapia. Entre los ejemplos del segundo grupo se incluyen los cuadros diarreicos graves, las fÃ­stulas gastrointestinales, la malabsorciÃ³n, el tratamiento diurÃ©tico y el tratamiento con gen tarn icina. Las estimaciones de la frecuencia de la hipomagnesenia clÃ­nica van de un 6 a un 11% entre pacientes nospitalizados. Entre los predictores sÃ©ricos de depleciÃ³n concomitante de magnesio figuran la hipocalemia (42%), hiponatremia (23%), hipofosfatemia (22%), a hipocalcemia (20%).Las observaciones experimentales y clinicas apoyan fuertemente el punto de vista de que el magnesio y el potasio se hallan estrechamente unidos a nivel celular. Se ha demostrado que el magnesio es importante en la energÃ©tica celular (A TPasa activada por Mg+ + ), en la conservaciÃ³n de la integridad de las membranas celulares, para diferir la pÃ©rdida celular de potasio y acentuar la captaciÃ³n del mismo por la cÃ©lula. Si bien el traslado de estas observaciones experimentales a la clÃ­nica se extiende sobre un amplio espectro de enfermedades, es especialmente importante considerar el papel del magnesio en la repletiÃ³n y conservatiÃ³n del potasio celular en 2 casos: a) pacientes tratados con digitalis y diurÃ©ticos y b) pacientes hipertensos. En este tipo de pacientes deberÃ­a administrarse no sÃ³lo potasio, sino tambiÃ©n magnesio, con el fin de evitar el problema de la depleciÃ³n celular de potasio y la resistencia al tratamiento de reposition del mismo que se acompaÃ±a de depleciÃ³n concomitante de magnesio no corregida.ResumoAs muitas causas da deficiÃªncia clinica de magnÃ©sio podem ser agrupadas em duas categorias: um consumo diminuido de magnÃ©sio e perdas aumentadas de magnÃ©sio, seja atravÃ©s do tubo gastrointestinal, seja pelos rins.

Safe Feature Elimination for the LASSO and Sparse Supervised Learning Problems,"We describe a fast method to eliminate features (variables) in l1 -penalized least-square regression (or LASSO) problems. The elimination of features leads to a potentially substantial reduction in running time, specially for large values of the penalty parameter. Our method is not heuristic: it only eliminates features that are guaranteed to be absent after solving the LASSO problem. The feature elimination step is easy to parallelize and can test each feature for elimination independently. Moreover, the computational effort of our method is negligible compared to that of solving the LASSO problem - roughly it is the same as single gradient step. Our method extends the scope of existing LASSO algorithms to treat larger data sets, previously out of their reach. We show how our method can be extended to general l1 -penalized convex problems and present preliminary results for the Sparse Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression problems.",2010,arXiv: Learning

"Diabetes, cancer and iron","Keywords Cancer.Diabetes.Iron.Mortality.PreventionTo the Editor: Zhou and colleagues found that diabetes andprediabetes (impaired glucose tolerance and/or impairedfasting glucose) were independent risk predictors for allcancer death, particularly death from liver cancer [1].However, the mechanisms underlying this detrimentalassociation have not been fully elucidated. We suggest thatincreased body iron stores may predispose individuals toboth diabetes and cancer.Mountingevidencesuggeststhatironmayplayaroleinthepathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and other hyperinsulinaemicsyndromes[2]. Indeed, it has been shown that increased ironstores contribute to insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemiaby reducing hepatic insulin extraction and metabolism [3]and by decreasing glucose uptake in muscle [4]. In additionto the potential effect of iron on insulin action, insulin mayalso affect iron metabolism. In vitro data suggest that insulinis capable of redistributing the cellular pool of transferrinreceptors, increasing the proportion at the cell surface,leading to increased cellular iron uptake in adipose tissueand the liver. This upregulating effect of insulin on ironuptake occurs concurrently with its effect on glucose uptake[2]. Epidemiological studies have reported a positiveassociation between large body iron stores and the risk oftype 2 diabetes [5]. Furthermore, induction of near irondeficiency in carbohydrate-intolerant individuals has beenshown to improve insulin sensitivity [6]. An interventionstudy in patients with type 2 diabetes with elevated ferritinlevels provided evidence that bloodletting resulting in a 50%reduction of serum ferritin concentrations (from 460 to222 ng/ml) improved glycaemia and insulin sensitivity [7].On the other hand, it is well known that individuals with amoderatelyelevatedironlevelhaveanelevatedcancerrisk[ 8].In particular, an independent association between incidenceof liver cancer and increased body iron level (approximatedby serum transferrin iron saturation) has been observed [9].In fact, a protective effect of iron loss against cancer riskhas been confirmed in the iron (Fe) and AtherosclerosisSTudy (FeAST), in which participants were randomised toiron reduction or control groups [10]. The FeAST study isthe first randomised trial of the effects of induced storediron reduction on cancer mortality. In the iron reductiongroup, the mean serum ferritin level declined from 122.5 to79.7 ng/ml. Over 4.5 years, the risk of new malignancy wassignificantly lower in the iron reduction group than in thecontrol group. Among patients with new cancers, thosewith iron reduction had lower cancer-specific and all-causemortality rates, which were highly significant. The FeASTtrial outcomes suggest that stored iron reduction may have abroad antitumour effect.Therefore, it is highly plausible that iron, hyperinsuli-naemia, insulin resistance and carcinogenesis are biologi-",2010,Diabetologia
Time Transfer by Laser Link: The T2L2 experiment on Jason 2,"The new generation of optical time transfer (T2L2 - Time Transfer by Laser Link) under development at OCA and CNES will allow the synchronization of remote ultra stable clocks and the determination of their performances over intercontinental distances. The principle is based on the propagation of light pulses between the clocks that are to be synchronized. T2L2 is the follow-on mission to LASSO (LAser Synchronization from Stationary Orbit) with performances improved by two orders of magnitude. Expected T2L2 performances are in the 100 ps range for accuracy, with an ultimate stability better than 1ps over 1,000s and than 10ps over one day. After a short overview of the instrumental heritage and the historic course of the project up to today's acceptation on Jason 2, we will report on a ground experiment conducted by OCA permitting to envision a performance improvement of at least one order of magnitude as compared to the best time transfer techniques available. Then preliminary performance budgets for the T2L2 on Jason 2 mission will be given, based on measurements conducted by OCA and expected performances of the space instrument.

Evaluation de la qualitÃ© nutritive des laits pasteurisÃ©s et des yaourts fabriquÃ©s au Burkina Faso,"Lâ€™objectif de cette etude etait dâ€™evaluer la valeur nutritive des laits crus, des laits pasteurises et des yaourts fabriques dans la zone peri-urbaine de Bobo-Dioulasso, au Burkina Faso de Juin a Aout 2012. Au total, 108 echantillons de lait cru, 216 echantillons de laits pasteurises et de yaourts fabriques au laboratoire et 216 echantillons de laits pasteurises et de yaourts fabriques par les laiteries ont ete analyses. La valeur nutritive des laits crus et pasteurises ont ete determinees par la methode infrarouge (FMA, Miris AB, Sweden, 2001). Un calibrage de la machine a ete faite pour lâ€™analyse des laits pasteurises. Pour les yaourts, les methodes de Kjeldahl, de Gerber et de la dessiccation ont ete utilisees pour determiner la proportion des matieres azotees, grasses, seches, minerales et calculer la proportion de lactose du lait. Lâ€™analyse des variances a ete appliquee sur les variables a lâ€™aide du logiciel XL-Stat version 6.1.9. Les resultats indiquent une legere variation entre la composition des laits crus et celle des laits pasteurises. Il en etait de meme pour les laits pasteurises conserves pendant 05 et 10 jours a +4Â°C. Quant a la valeur nutritive des yaourts analyses le jour de la fabrication, les resultats ont montre une variation notable sur le taux de glucides (9,85-10,21%) et de matieres seches (12,80-14,97%) explique par un ajout de matieres seches au niveau des laiteries. Pour les yaourts gardes a +4Â°C pendant 15 et 30 jours, on a note une diminution non significative sur les parametres du lait. La pasteurisation ne change pas significativement la qualite nutritionnelle du lait. Les yaourts fabriques par les laiteries artisanales au Burkina Faso sont de bonne qualite nutritionnelle. Un yaourt fabrique dans les conditions des laiteries locales et garde immediatement a +4Â°C au refrigerateur peut sejourner pendant 30 jours sans se deteriorer. Enfin, une etude complementaire sur les parametres microbiologiques dans les memes conditions est a envisager. Mots-cles: lait cru, lait pasteurise, yaourts, Burkina Faso. Assessment of nutritional quality of pasteurized milks and yoghurts made in Burkina Faso The aim of the study was to assess the nutritional quality of raw milks, pasteurized milks and yoghurt made in the city of Bobo-Dioulaso, in Burkina Faso. The study was carried out from June to august 2012 on 108 raw milks samples, 216 pasteurized milks and yoghurts samples made in the laboratory and 216 pasteurized milks and yoghurts samples made by the dairy processing units. Milks samples were determined for fat, protein, lactose, sugar, dry matter and solids non-fat contents using mid-infra-red spectroscopy (FMA, Miris AB Sweden). The equipment was calibrated for determination of pasteurized milk content. Methods of Kjeldahl, Gerber and drying were used to determine percentage of protein, fat, dry matter and solids non-fat contents respectively. Lactose content was calculated. The data was subjected to ANOVA using XL-Stat software version 6.1.9. The results showed very little variation of milk components between raw milk and pasteurized milk. No significant variation was also got between 5 and 10 days when pasteurized milks were stored at +4Â°C. It was found high sugar content in yoghurt (9.85-10.21%) and dry matter content was up to 14.97% which means dry matter was added to raw milk during the processing a the dairy unit level. When yoghurts were stored at +4Â°C, milk components contents decreased without any significant variation after 15 to 30 days. It was concluded that, pasteurization has no effect on milk nutritional value of milk. Furthermore, yoghurts made by local dairy processing units in Burkina Faso showed good nutritional value. Finally, yoghurt made in local conditions of Burkina Faso could be stored in the refrigerator at +4Â°C during 30 days without any significant damage of its nutritional value. Finally, an additional study on microbiological quality of dairy products in the same conditions ought to be carried out. Keywords : raw milk, pasteurized milk, yoghurt, Burkina Faso.",2015,

Can user and task characteristics be used as predictors of success in health information retrieval sessions?,"Introduction. The concept and study of relevance has been a central subject in information science. Although research in information retrieval has been focused on topical relevance, other kinds of relevance are also important and justify further study. Motivational relevance is typically inferred by criteria such as user satisfaction and success. Method. Using an existing dataset composed by an annotated set of health Web documents assessed for relevance and comprehension by a group of users, we build a multivariate prediction model for the motivational relevance of search sessions. Analysis. The analysis was based on lasso variable selection, followed by model selection using multiple logistic regression. Results. We have built two regression models; the full model, which considers all variables of the dataset, has a lower estimated prediction error than the reduced model, which contains the statistically-significant variables from the full model. The higher values of evaluation metrics, including accuracy, specificity and sensitivity in the full model support this finding. The full model has an accuracy of 91.94%, and is better at predicting motivational relevance. Conclusions. Our findings suggest features that can be considered by search engines to estimate motivational relevance, to be used in addition to topical relevance. Among these features, a high level of success in Web search and in health information search on social networks and chats are some of the most influencing user features. This shows that users with higher computer literacy might feel more satisfied and successful after completing the search tasks. In terms of task features, the results suggest that users with clearer goals feel more successful. Moreover, results show that users would benefit from the help of the system in clarifying the retrieved documents.",2018,Inf. Res.
Effect of small interference RNA (siRNA) for ADAMTS5 on intervertebral disc degeneration in the rabbit anular needle-puncture model,"IntroductionThe etiology of degenerative disc disease is unknown. Several investigators have reported the presence of proteolytic enzymes, such as the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin-like repeats) families, in degenerated human discs. Glasson and colleagues recently reported that a significant reduction occurs in the severity of cartilage destruction in ADAMTS5 knockout mice compared with wild-type mice. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the suppressive effects of injections of ADAMTS5 small interference RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotide on intervertebral disc degeneration in the rabbit anular needle-puncture model.MethodsRabbit nucleus pulposus (NP) cells were transfected with siRNA oligonucleotides specific for ADAMTS5 or the control. The suppression of the ADAMTS5 gene by siRNA transfection was assessed by using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), both in monolayer and alginate bead cultures with or without interleukin-1Î² (IL-1Î²) stimulation. The effect of siRNA was determined in vivo by using the rabbit anular needle-puncture model (control group: n = 8; ADAMTS5 group: n = 8). One week after the initial anular puncture, the animals received an injection of the control or anti-ADAMTS5 oligonucleotide (100 Î¼g each at the L2/3 and L4/5 level; 16 discs/group). Disc height, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Thompson classification and signal intensity), and safranin-O staining (histologic grade) were assessed.ResultsIL-1Î² treatment significantly increased the ADAMTS5 mRNA level in NP cells (P < 0.01). ADAMTS5 gene suppression was 70% compared with the control oligonucleotide in both monolayer and alginate bead culture with or without stimulation with IL-1Î². The injection of anti-ADAMTS5 oligonucleotide in vivo resulted in improved MRI scores with increased signal intensity and improved histologic grade scores with statistical significance (P < 0.05). No significant change in disc height was observed.ConclusionsA single injection of ADAMTS5 siRNA induced the suppression of degradation in NP tissues, as shown by significantly improved MRI and histologic grades. The mechanism of response to siRNA may be worthy of exploration for possible therapeutic purposes.",2009,Arthritis Research & Therapy
The Rrp6 C-terminal domain binds RNA and activates the nuclear RNA exosome,"The eukaryotic RNA exosome is an essential, multi-subunit complex that catalyzes RNA turnover, maturation, and quality control processes. Its non-catalytic donut-shaped core includes 9 subunits that associate with the 3' to 5' exoribonucleases Rrp6, and Rrp44/Dis3, a subunit that also catalyzes endoribonuclease activity. Although recent structures and biochemical studies of RNA bound exosomes from S. cerevisiae revealed that the Exo9 central channel guides RNA to either Rrp6 or Rrp44 using partially overlapping and mutually exclusive paths, several issues related to RNA recruitment remain. Here, we identify activities for the highly basic Rrp6 C-terminal tail that we term the 'lasso' because it binds RNA and stimulates ribonuclease activities associated with Rrp44 and Rrp6 within the 11-subunit nuclear exosome. Stimulation is dependent on the Exo9 central channel, and the lasso contributes to degradation and processing activities of exosome substrates in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we present evidence that the Rrp6 lasso may be a conserved feature of the eukaryotic RNA exosome.",2017,Nucleic Acids Research
A temporal deconvolution algorithm for multiecho functional MRI,"This work introduces a novel method for the temporal deconvolution of the BOLD signal for multiecho functional MRI (fMRI) data: Multiecho Paradigm Free Mapping (ME-PFM). By solving an inverse problem with the Generalized LASSO, this method obtains voxelwise time-varying estimates of the changes in the transverse relaxation (R) and the net magnetization (So) of the fMRI signal without prior knowledge of the timings of the BOLD responses. Our results with experimental data demonstrate that the maps of R changes obtained with ME-PFM at the times of the stimulus trials closely resemble the maps obtained with a standard approach that is aware of the onsets and durations of the events. Compared with previous deconvolution approaches for BOLD fMRI, this method yields estimates of R changes in physiologically interpretable units, which is particularly relevant for the quantification of the dynamics of the BOLD fMRI signal during tasks and resting state.",2018,2018 IEEE 15th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2018)

What were they thinking of? Relief decorated pottery from Sagalassos: a cognitive approach,"The use of images was a central point in ancient religious practice, as cult required the faculty of representing the divinity. Decorated pottery is one category of objects carrying such divine images. The reconstruction and understanding of the religious symbolic system for the Pisidian town of Sagalassos (SW-Turkey) from early imperial to early Byzantine times, through the medium of its relief decorated pottery, is the aim of this paper. Although such objects can rarely be used to prove cultic activity, they provide an impression of the religious symbolism that impregnated everyday life. The scenes chosen to figure on bowls and dishes were intentional statements and were therefor representative for the contemporary symbolic system. A consistent aspect of the Sagalassian decorated pottery is that its imagery throughout the centuries of production reflects wider ideological developments as well as local characteristics. Therefore, the decorated pottery manufactured and used in the town serves as a guide to its religious actuality.",2005,

Whole-gear efficiency of a benthic survey trawl for flatfish,"Whole-gear efficiency (the proportion of fish passing between the otter doors of a bottom trawl that are subsequently captured) was estimated from data collected during experiments to measure the herding efficiency of bridles and doors, the capture efficiency of the net, and the length of the bridles sufficiently close to the seafloor to elicit a herding response. The experiments were focused on four species of flatfish: arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias), flathead sole (Hippoglossoides elassodon), rex sole (Glyptocephalus zachirus), and Dover sole (Microstomus pacificus). Whole-gear efficiency varied with fish length and reached maximum values between 40% and 50% for arrowtooth flounder, flathead sole, and rex sole. For Dover sole, however, whole-gear efficiency declined from a maximum of 33% over the length range sampled. Such efficiency estimates can be used to determine catchability, which, in turn, can be used to improve the accuracy of stock assessment models when the time series of a survey is short.",2007,

An efficient Hessian based algorithm for solving large-scale sparse group Lasso problems,"The sparse group Lasso is a widely used statistical model which encourages the sparsity both on a group and within the group level. In this paper, we develop an efficient augmented Lagrangian method for large-scale non-overlapping sparse group Lasso problems with each subproblem being solved by a superlinearly convergent inexact semismooth Newton method. Theoretically, we prove that, if the penalty parameter is chosen sufficiently large, the augmented Lagrangian method converges globally at an arbitrarily fast linear rate for the primal iterative sequence, the dual infeasibility, and the duality gap of the primal and dual objective functions. Computationally, we derive explicitly the generalized Jacobian of the proximal mapping associated with the sparse group Lasso regularizer and exploit fully the underlying second order sparsity through the semismooth Newton method. The efficiency and robustness of our proposed algorithm are demonstrated by numerical experiments on both the synthetic and real data sets.",2020,Mathematical Programming
Structural mechanism of transcription inhibition by Lasso Peptides Microcin J25 and Capistruin,"We report crystal structures of the antibacterial lasso peptides microcin J25 (MccJ25) and capistruin (Cap) bound to their natural enzymatic target, the bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP). Both peptides bind within the RNAP secondary channel, through which NTP substrates enter the RNAP active site, and sterically block trigger-loop folding, which is essential for efficient catalysis by the RNAP. MccJ25 binds deep within the secondary channel in a manner expected to interfere with NTP substrate binding, explaining the partial competitive mechanism of inhibition with respect to NTPs found previously [Mukhopadhyay J, Sineva E, Knight J, Levy RM, Ebright RH (2004) Mol Cell 14:739â€“751]. The Cap binding determinant on RNAP overlaps, but is not identical to, that of MccJ25. Cap binds further from the RNAP active site and does not sterically interfere with NTP binding, and we show that Cap inhibition is partially noncompetitive with respect to NTPs. This work lays the groundwork for structure determination of other lasso peptides that target the bacterial RNAP and provides a structural foundation to guide lasso peptide antimicrobial engineering approaches.",2019,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
Evaluating the Detection of Hydrocarbon-Degrading Bacteria in 16S rRNA Gene Sequencing Surveys,"Hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria (HCB) play a key role in the biodegradation of oil hydrocarbons in marine and other environments. A small number of taxa have been identified as obligate HCB, notably the Gammaproteobacterial genera Alcanivorax, Cycloclasticus, Marinobacter, Neptumonas, Oleiphilus, Oleispira, and Thalassolituus, as well as the Alphaproteobacterial genus Thalassospira. Detection of HCB in amplicon-based sequencing surveys relies on high coverage by PCR primers and accurate taxonomic classification. In this study, we performed a phylogenetic analysis to identify 16S rRNA gene sequence regions that represent the breadth of sequence diversity within these taxa. Using validated sequences, we evaluated 449 universal 16S rRNA gene-targeted bacterial PCR primer pairs for their coverage of these taxa. The results of this analysis provide a practical framework for selection of suitable primer sets for optimal detection of HCB in sequencing surveys.",2017,Frontiers in Microbiology
SAT0004 Genomic Stratification by HLA-DRB4 Expression Identifies Innate and Adaptive Immune Patterns as Differential Predictors of Response To Methotrexate in Rheumatoid Arthritis,"Background Variability of clinical course and response to therapy in RA suggests differences in molecular mechanisms depending on stage and sub-entity of the disease. Most dominant molecular discriminators are HLA-DR4 shared epitope (SE), and the status of rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA) development, all indicating subentities with influence on severity and outcome. Objectives Early RA prior to methotrexate (MTX) treatment was investigated to exclude major therapeutic influence. By comparing whole blood transcriptomes between subsequent responders and non-responders we aimed to unravel molecular mechanisms with influence on MTX outcome of RA. Methods Whole blood of 52 patients with early RA was obtained in the HITHARD and in the ArthroMark study. Clinical characteristics assessed at baseline and after 16 weeks included RF, ACPA, DAS28 and EULAR response for classification in good (GR), moderate (MR) and non-responders (NR). Total RNA was globin reduced and processed according to standard protocols for hybridization to U133 Plus 2.0 microarrays. Biostatistical methods included MAS5.0 and RMA algorithms with limma, lasso and Wilcoxon tests. For functional interpretation, expression of candidate genes was tested in various blood cell types and stimulation conditions using own and GEO reference transcriptomes. Marker selection was validated by qPCR with commercial primers and four different housekeeping genes. Results Different biostatistical approaches favored MAS5.0 algorithms for marker selection. Comparison between good and non-responders in unselected patients revealed insufficient discriminatory power. Generating different subgroups defined by gender, status of RF, ACPA, SE, HLA-DRB4 or DQA1 identified molecular patterns with a strong discrimination between GR and NR in HLA-DRB4 â€“ patients. All other subgroups did not improve pattern selection. In HLA-DRB4 â€“ patients, genes increased in GR were related to phagocytes and bone marrow activation whereas genes increased in NR were associated with lymphocyte activity. In HLA-DRB4 + patients, patterns of adaptive immunity were again related to non-response but frequently combined also with innate patterns. Receiver-operating-characteristics (ROC) with the top 20 markers in HLA-DRB4 â€“ and DRB4 + subgroups revealed AUC â€“ group and reached AUC up to 0.89 in HLA-DRB4 + patients. Conclusions Genetic stratification revealed transcriptional patterns that indicate different molecular pathomechanisms in RA depending on response to MTX therapy. Interestingly, the group responding to MTX was dominated by phagocyte but not lymphocyte activity, which may indicate an important contribution of innate triggers to the pathomechanisms in RA.

"Signal Flies of the genus Duomyia ( Diptera : Platystomatidae ) in the Northern Territory , Australia","A key is given to the species of Duomyia Walker, 1849, (approximately 26) recognized in the Northern Territory of Australia. The following new species are described: D. nodosa, D. rapida, D. grahami, D. tricurva, D. bucina, D. recta, D. prensans, D. praeflava, D. korneyevi, D. lana, D. collessi, D. maceveyi, D. whittingtoni. Duomyia sericea Hendel and D. serra McAlpine are newly recorded for the Northern Territory; D. foliata McAlpine is newly recorded for New South Wales; D. tomentosa Hendel is newly recorded for Western Australia; and D. eremia McAlpine is newly recorded for South Australia. The question of possible recent extinction of D. irregularis Malloch is raised, and the urgent need to establish the population status of other rarely seen species is mentioned. Mcalpine, DaviD K. 2012. Signal flies of the genus Duomyia (Diptera: Platystomatidae) in the Northern Territory, Australia. Records of the Australian Museum 64(2): 121â€“148. Nine of the 26 recorded Australian genera of Platystomatidae, or signal flies, are known in the Northern Territory, viz. Achias, Aetha, Duomyia, Elassogaster, Euprosopia, Lamprogaster, Plagiostenopterina, Rhytidortalis, and Rivellia (see McAlpine, 2001, for key to genera). This compares with 25 genera living in Queensland, and illustrates the decline in wet forest taxonomic diversity, as one proceeds from east to west in the Australian tropics, and a degree of isolation of the NT seasonally wet zone from that of the eastern Australian tropics. The endemic Australian platystomatid genus Duomyia includes 70 previously described species (see McAlpine, 1973, 2001, 2011), but study of collections indicates that over 110 species exist. About 26 species are here recognized for the NT, of which 13 appear to be endemic to the Territory. Several apparent species, represented by material that is inadequate for precise characterization, are assigned provisional numbers. The larger number of Duomyia species in the NT compared with that in other NT platystomatid genera correlates with the ability of numerous Duomyia species to survive in relatively dry climates. By contrast, the genus Euprosopia has only two species in the NT, compared with at least 29 species in the Queensland tropics (some undescribed). Duomyia irregularis Malloch, from vicinity of Darwin, has apparently not been collected for more than 100 years (see p. 147). As it is a small, inconspicuous insect and recent collecting in the area has not been thorough, I do not regard this as firm evidence of extinction. The following species have each been collected on only one occasion: Duomyia rapida n.sp., D. bucina n.sp., D. prensans n.sp., D. lana n.sp.; also, some other species are known from very few specimens. Investigation of the population status of these insects by locally resident entomologists is needed. A summary of general information on the genus Duomyia, including generic synonymy and a little information on habits and ecology, was previously given (McAlpine, 2001). A key to species was given by McAlpine (1973, supplemented by McAlpine, 2011). The division of such a large genus as Duomyia into subgenera or species groups seems desirable, but this desideratum has not yet proved attainable. Although there are some small groups of evidently related species, many other species do not readily fit into groups or are intermediate between such groups. Malloch (1929) proposed the subgenus Duomyza for D. tomentosa Hendel. Some species are closely 122 Records of the Australian Museum (2012) Vol. 64 related to D. tomentosa, but a range of species shows a gradation in character states and combinations, and some species sharing with that species the possession of minor scutellar setulae are probably not close phylogenetically. Also, the presence of spinescent posteroventral bristles on the fore femur cannot be used to define a natural group within the genus, although Enderlein (1924) proposed the genus Helocnemia for one such species [Duomyia apicalis (Walker) of Western Australia]. In this paper I recognize the informal tomentosa alliance, indicated below in the key to species, but less well defined outside the NT; also the grahami alliance, apparently endemic to the NT, including D. grahami, D. tricurva, D. bucina, and D. recta; and I have previously recognized the ameniina alliance (McAlpine, 2011), of which D. ameniina and D. rugula live in the NT. A less well defined spinifemorata alliance is discussed under D. spinifemorata. Terminology and abbreviations Descriptive terminology is that used in my previous papers (McAlpine, 1973, 2011). Terminology for parts of the aedeagus is shown in Figs 10, 22. The following abbreviations refer to institutions housing specimens: AM Australian Museum, Sydney ANIC Australian National Insect Collection, CSIRO, Canberra BM The Natural History Museum, London DEI Deutsches Entomologisches Institut, MÃ¼ncheberg NTM Northern Territory Museum, Darwin QM Queensland Museum, South Brisbane. Insect collection formerly at University of Queensland SAM South Australian Museum, Adelaide In my text the abbreviation NT refers to the Northern Territory of Australia. The following collectorsâ€™ names are abbreviated to the initials: T.L. Bancroft, G.R. Brown, G. Cassis, D.H. Colless, A. Daniels, G. Daniels, D.E. Havenstein, K. Hill, P. Horne, M. Humphrey, K.A. Kopestonsky, Z.R. Liepa, D. Marshall, D.K. McAlpine, B.J. Moulds, M.S. Moulds, C. Owen, H. Pelz, N.B. Tindale, M.S. Upton, J.L. Wassell. Seasonal occurrence of adults Although collecting activity for platystomatids has not been consistent enough to establish precisely the months of adult activity for individual species, there is some evidence for seasonal difference in activity among the species living in the seasonally wet north of the Northern Territory. The field work of D. H. Colless, centred around November 1972, produced series of the following species which have not been collected at other times of the year: Duomyia collessi, D. lana, and D. praeflava. In Februaryâ€“March 1996 G. R. Brown and the author obtained 2 or more specimens of D. grahami, D. tricurva, and D. whittingtoni. Duomyia spinifemorata is known from material collected in late December to February. These last four species are not recorded for as early as November. Duomyia korneyevi was collected by D.H.C. in both November 1972 and March 1973. Duomyia sericea has been collected in the area during January, February, April, June, and August, and in Lawn Hill National Park, Queensland, near the border with Northern Territory, in May. Thus it appears that D. korneyevi may have two broods and D. sericea a greater number during the year. Several other species have been collected on only one or two occasions, but their dates are inadequate for any conclusions regarding seasonal occurrence.

Efficient Feature Selection With Large and High-dimensional Data,"Driven by the advances in technology, large and high-dimensional data have become the rule rather than the exception. Approaches that allow for feature selection with such data are thus highly sought after, in particular, since standard methods, like cross-validated Lasso, can be computationally intractable and, in any case, lack theoretical guarantees. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to feature selection in regression. Consisting of simple optimization steps and tests, it is computationally more efficient than existing methods and, therefore, suited even for very large data sets. Moreover, in contrast to standard methods, it is equipped with sharp statistical guarantees. We thus expect that our algorithm can help to leverage the increasing volume of data in Biology, Public Health, Astronomy, Economics, and other fields.",2016,arXiv: Methodology

Title : Discovery of Salmonella Virulence Factors Translocated via Outer Membrane Vesicles ( OMV ) to Murine Macrophages Running Title : Secretion of Salmonella Virulence Factors via OMV,"Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, an intracellular pathogen and leading cause of foodborne illness, encodes a plethora of virulence effectors. Salmonella virulence factors are translocated into host cells and manipulate host cellular activities, providing a more hospitable environment for bacterial proliferation. In this study, we report a new set of virulence factors that is translocated into the host cytoplasm via bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMV). PagK (or PagK1), PagJ, and STM2585A (or PagK2) are small proteins composed of ~ 70 amino acids and have high sequence homology to each other (>85% identity). Salmonella lacking all three homologues was attenuated for virulence in a mouse infection model, suggesting at least partial functional redundancy among them. While each homologue was translocated into the macrophage cytoplasm, their translocation was independent of all three Salmonella-encoded type III secretion systems (T3SSs) â€“ SPI-1 T3SS, SPI-2 T3SS, and the flagellar system. Selected methods, including direct microscopy, demonstrated that the PagK-homologous proteins were secreted through outer membrane vesicles (OMV), which were enriched with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and outer membrane proteins. Vesicles produced by intracellular bacteria also contained lysosomalassociated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1), suggesting the possibility of OMV convergence with host cellular components during intracellular trafficking. This study identified novel Salmonella virulence factors secreted via OMV and demonstrated that OMV can function as a vehicle to transfer virulence determinants to the infected host cell cytoplasm. Key word: Salmonella, type III secretion system (T3SS), outer membrane vesicles (OMV), secretion effectors on N ovem er 2, 2017 by gest http/iai.asm .rg/ D ow nladed fom Secretion of Salmonella Virulence Factors via OMV Introduction Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (hereafter S. Typhimurium) utilizes a secretory cascade of virulence effectors to interact with host cells. More than 40 secreted virulence factors have been identified in Salmonella to date, but the functions and mechanisms of action are largely undefined (35, 52). Effector proteins conduct diverse functional activities, including actin rearrangement, modulation of vesicular trafficking, induction of inflammatory response, and regulation of motility of infected cells (52, 75, 80). Salmonella tightly controls the expression and secretion of virulence determinants to disrupt host cell activities at appropriate times and locations during infection. Failure to properly regulate these effectors in an appropriate manner results in attenuation of Salmonella virulence (14, 55, 57, 61). Thus, finely tuned regulation of virulence effectors allows Salmonella to respond to the host defense system, permitting persistent infection and promoting dissemination of the pathogen to other hosts. The type III secretion system (T3SS), the best-characterized secretion apparatus, is a specialized needle-like organelle made up of more than 20 components and it delivers more than 30 Salmonella effectors into host cells (25, 34, 58, 59). Salmonella pathogenicity island (SPI)-1 and SPI-2, mapping to separate regions on the S. Typhimurium chromosome, encode genes for distinct T3SSs, in addition to encoding regulators, chaperones, and effector proteins. Virulence determinants secreted from SPI-1 T3SS primarily play roles in host cell invasion and enhance intestinal inflammation (25). SPI-2 T3SS-secreted virulence effectors are required for intracellular replication and persistence and inhibit the inflammatory response during a systemic infection (25). The flagellar system is structurally related to T3SS and may secrete virulence factors as well (31, 78, 79). Although Salmonella possesses other secretion mechanisms, including a two-partner secretion system (ZirT/ZirS) (24) and a type VI secretion system (9), the T3SS is considered the on N ovem er 2, 2017 by gest http/iai.asm .rg/ D ow nladed fom Secretion of Salmonella Virulence Factors via OMV major mechanism to deliver virulence factors to the host cell. Therefore, identification of virulence factors secreted independent of these well-studied systems is important to understanding Salmonella pathogenesis. In this study, we demonstrate that outer membrane vesicles (OMV) can act as a means to deliver previously unknown Salmonella virulence factors. Previous work has demonstrated that OMV are released from the cell envelope of Gram-negative bacteria and are comprised of a variety of outer membrane and periplasmic constituents, including proteins, phospholipids, lipopolysaccharides, and DNA (18, 44, 49, 64). The vesicles can vary in size from 10 to 300 nm in diameter depending on a number of factors and can serve as a vehicle to deliver the vesicular contents to adjacent bacterial and animal cells, as well as to the extracellular milieu (10, 22, 40, 41, 43). Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) encloses ClyA, a pore-forming cytotoxin, in OMV and exports it to the extracellular environment, thereby making contact with eukaryotic cells (74). OMV not only disseminate toxins and enzymes into host cells to protect bacterial survival, but also serve as bacterial-like decoys to neutralize the host immune responses and facilitate Gramnegative pathogensâ€™ immune evasion (10, 71). OMV delivery of antigens has been a large area of investigation as OMV could improve vaccines by delivery to the MHC class I pathway while simultaneously providing pathogen-associated molecular patterns as adjuvant (2, 4, 62, 73). Based on the accumulative OMV observation in a variety of microorganisms, multiple biological functions of OMV including virulence attributes and its biogenesis including production mechanism and cargo selectivity have been reviewed recently (1, 21, 46). Using proteomics method to characterize the proteins that Salmonella secretes into culture media under intracellularmimicking conditions, we identified a group of proteins that are secreted independently from SPI-2 T3SS (58). Here, we demonstrate that a subset of these T3SS-independent secreted proteins is on N ovem er 2, 2017 by gest http/iai.asm .rg/ D ow nladed fom Secretion of Salmonella Virulence Factors via OMV translocated into the host cytoplasm via OMV, including PagK (PagK1), PagJ, and STM2585A (PagK2). on N ovem er 2, 2017 by gest http/iai.asm .rg/ D ow nladed fom Secretion of Salmonella Virulence Factors via OMV Materials and Methods Bacterial strains and plasmids Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimuirum 14028s was used as the parent in all strains studied here. All deletion and tagged strains were constructed using the phage Î» Red recombination system (17). In brief, the kanamycin resistance (kan) or chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) cassette was amplified by PCR with 40-nt flanking sequences, homologous to target genes, at both termini. PCR products were introduced into recipient cells harboring pKD46 to replace target genes with a kan or cat cassette. Antibiotic marker genes were subsequently removed by flip recombinase provided from pCP20 to make in-frame deletions that were presumably non-polar (17). Tagging of chromosomal genes with cyaAâ€™ was performed in a similar way using Î» Redmediated recombination. Instead of pKD13mod (77) and pKD3 (17) as PCR templates, pMiniTn5-cycler (30) was used to insert a DNA fragment encoding a carboxy-terminal peptide of CyaA and kanamycin resistance immediately prior to the stop codon sequence of PagJ, PagK1, and PagK2. Construction of chromosomal sipA::cyaAâ€™ and sseJ::cyaAâ€™ was described previously (30). In order to construct derivatives of PagK homologue-CyaAâ€™ fusions, which lack their N-termini or contain their N-termini only, an additional flanking sequence providing the ribosome binding site (RBS) and a new start codon was positioned upstream of the truncated cyaAâ€™ fusions on pMJW1753 (30). DNA fragments encoding intact PagK homologue-CyaAâ€™ fusions were also cloned on pMJ1753 by the same strategy and served as the reference to the truncated fusion constructs.

This fusion construct should not be secreted by either T3SS or OMV as is demonstrated. To visualize Salmonella using red fluorescent protein (Tomato; (68)), bacteria were transformed with pWKS30-Tomato (29). Bacteria cells were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium or an acidic minimal medium as described previously (AMM1; (77)). Macrophage infection Murine macrophage-like cells (ATCC RAW264.7; (63)), were prepared and infected as described previously (77). Except for bacteria containing a sipA::cyaAâ€™ allele, all Salmonella strains were prepared for infection as described below. Salmonella cells grown overnight in LB were opsonized with 10% mouse serum (Innovative Research) for 20 min prior to infection. Bacteria cells resuspended in Dulbeccoâ€™s Modified Eagleâ€™s Medium (DMEM) were added to macrophages monolayers at an input multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 100 and infections were initiated by centrifuging at 1,000Ã—g for 5 min. Infected macrophages were incubated at 37Â°C with 5% CO2 for 30 min, and extracellular bacteria were subsequently removed by PBS washing and incubation in DMEM containing gentamicin (Gibco) at 100 Î¼g/ml for 1 hour. After gentamicin (100 Î¼g/ml) treatment, cells were washed with PBS three times and overlaid with DMEM containing 20 Î¼g/ml gentamicin for the remainder of the experiments.

Identification of Novel lncRNA Markers in Glioblastoma Multiforme and Their Clinical Significance: A Study Based on Multiple Sequencing Data,"Background
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been verified to have a vital role in the progression of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Our research was about to identify the potential lncRNAs which was closely associated with the pathogenesis and prognosis of glioblastoma multiforme.


Methods
All RNA sequence profiling data from patients with GBM were obtained from The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Differently expressed genes identified from GBM and control samples were used to construct competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network and perform corresponding functional enrichment analysis. Univariate Cox regression followed by lasso regression and multivariate Cox was used to validate independent lncRNA factors and construct a risk prediction model. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed to verify the expression levels of potential lncRNA biomarkers in human GBM clinical specimens. A gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was subsequently conducted to explore potential signaling pathways in which critical lncRNAs may be involved. Moreover, nomogram plot was applied based on our prediction model and significant clinical covariates to visualize the prognosis of GBM patients.


Results
A total of 2023 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) including 56 lncRNAs, 1587 message RNAs (mRNAs) and 380 other RNAs were included. Based on predictive databases, 16lncRNAs, 32 microRNAs (miRNAs) and 99 mRNAs were used to construct a ceRNA network. Moreover, we performed a novel risk prediction model with 5 potential prognostic lncRNAs, in which 4 of them were newly identified in GBM, to predict the prognosis of GBM patients. Finally, a nomogram plot was constructed to illustrate the potential relationship between the prognosis of GBM and our risk prediction model and significant clinical covariates.


Conclusion
In this study, we identified 4 novel potential lncRNA biomarkers and constructed a prediction model of GBM prognosis. A simple-to-use nomogram was provided for further clinical application.",2020,OncoTargets and therapy
Revisiting detachment techniques in human-biting ticks.,"BACKGROUND
Early and complete removal of ticks using the right technique is important to reduce tick-transmitted diseases. Several chemical and mechanical detachment techniques have been described previously.


OBJECTIVE
We aimed to compare the performance of 4 tick-detachment techniques that are widely used in human beings and to determine the optimal method from these techniques.


METHODS
A cross-sectional study was conducted on 160 patients between April and June 2010. Patients with reported tick bite were reviewed retrospectively and divided into the following 4 groups according to the tick-detachment technique used: card detachment, lassoing, freezing, and tweezers. Performance of each technique was evaluated according to the number of fully detached, nondetached, and crushed ticks and the duration of application.


RESULTS
Of the 160 tick-bite cases assessed, we found the following efficacy rates: 82.5% (33/40), technique using tweezers; 47.5% (19/40), lassoing technique; 7.5% (3/40), card detachment; and 0% (0/40), freezing technique. The efficacy rate of the technique using tweezers was significantly higher than that of the other 3 techniques (PÂ <Â .05).


LIMITATIONS
This was a relatively small sample size and not designed as a randomized clinical trial.


CONCLUSION
Tick detachment using tweezers, performed in an appropriate manner, is the easiest and most effective technique.",2016,Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology
The Rotate Stress of Steam Turbine Prediction Method Based on Stacking Ensemble Learning,"The rotor is one of the most durable parts for a steam turbine. The main shaft, blades or impellers will generate huge transient stress due to high rotate speed, strong torque, and high-temperature steam in the starting up and stopping and other processes, thus, the rotor will face the acid test. As a result, the analysis and prediction of the transient stress of the rotor become the key point in steam turbine life management. The steam turbine is always in high-speed rotation under different poor working conditions, and it is difficult to measure the transient stress directly. In actual production, the finite element analysis is the main method to obtain the stress distribution, lacking measurement accuracy and timeliness. In this paper, we proposed a novel calculation method based on data-driven. Firstly, building a single prediction model based on the Lasso regression, the Elastic net, and the Random forest. Secondly, utilize an ensemble learning based on the stacking to combines a single prediction model to acquire better prediction accuracy. Finally, the case result indicates the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Core set construction and association analysis of Pinus massoniana from Guangdong province in southern China using SLAF-seq,"Germplasm resource collection and utilization are important in forestry species breeding. High-through sequencing technologies have been playing increasing roles in forestry breeding. In this study, specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) was employed to analyze 149 masson pine (Pinus massoniana) accessions collected from Guangdong in China. A large number of 471,660 SNPs in the total collection were identified from 599,164 polymorphic SLAF tags. Population structure analysis showed that 149 masson pines could not be obviously divided into subpopulations. Two core sets, containing 29 masson pine accessions for increasing resin and wood yield respectively, were obtained from the total collection. Phenotypic analyses of five traits showed abundant variations, 25 suggestive and 9 significant SNPs were associated with the resin-yielding capacity (RYCâ€™) and volume of wood (VW) using EMMAX and FaST-LMM; 22 suggestive and 11 significant SNPs were associated with RYCâ€™ and VW using mrMLM and FASTmrMLM. Moreover, a large number of associated SNPs were detected in trait HT, DBH, RW and RYC using mrMLM, FASTmrMLM, FASTmrEMMA and ISIS EM-BLASSO. The core germplasm sets would be a valuable resource for masson pine improvement and breeding. In addition, the associated SNP markers would be meaningful for masson pine resource selection.",2019,Scientific Reports
Molecular dynamics simulation and binding free energy calculations of Microcin J25 Binding to the FhuA Receptor.,"Microcins are low-molecular weight, highly stable, ribosomally produced, bacterial inhibitory molecules involved in competitive research. Microcin J25 consists of 21 amino acids and has a lasso-like structure. The first step is bacteria binding to the ion receptor of FhuA on the bacterial surface. In this study, molecular dynamics simulation was implemented to study the binding mechanism of MJ25 and three mutants, to find the changing of individual amino acids in the Î²-hair region of MJ25. The binding-free energy calculation was subjected to MJ25 and FhuA. In addition, computational mutation analysis was revealed for association between MJ25 and FhuA. However, we found that the mutating 12th amino acid of the Î²-hair region into histidine is extremely important for the binding of MJ25 to FhuA. In addition, the number of hydrogen bonds is essential for binding of MJ25 to FhuA. The overall results show that the key guiding significance is improving the sterilizing efficiency of MJ25 and the drug design of MJ25.",2020,Journal of biomolecular structure & dynamics

Examining the Relations of Teacher-Directed and Inquiry-Based Science Instruction to Adolescent Studentsâ€™ Science Dispositions: A Multilevel Analysis Across 65 Countries,"School, Industry, University Partnerships: Impact of a University-STEM Industry Engagement on Secondary Students in Science Carol Aldous, Flinders University Lifting student engagement in STEM has been the aim of numerous government initiatives within recent decades (Ng & Fergusson, 2019). One of these Bridging the Gap: Connecting Science Education to the real world enabled 36 pre-service teachers to engage with industry through three visits. During the engagement, student teachers identified, translated and communicated a STEM industry problem to an authentic audience. Subsequently, student teachers undertook their final teaching practicum. Measures of the projectâ€™s impact were ascertained by focus group interview and questionnaire pre and post the industry visit as well as with secondary studentsâ€™ pre and post the teaching practicum. The student teacher questionnaire was purpose designed. The questionnaire for secondary students comprised the PISA 2006/2015 science attitudes inventory. The percent agreement pre (n= 213) and post (n=305) the teaching practicum were compared alongside state (South Australian) and national (Australian) figures. In a matched sample (n= 108) five dimensions, science selfefficacy, science related activities, future-oriented science motivation, science teaching uses investigations and science self-concept were found to be significantly different pre to post. In the unmatched sample the mean percent agreement increased pre to post for all dimensions except science teaching uses hands on activities where it remained the same. Reference: Ng, W.

The nature of an individualâ€™s rope reflects their varied experience, but scientific literacy requires weaving of strands from all three dimensions. Building primary studentsâ€™ experience of the Nature of Science strand can be particularly challenging. Online citizen science [OCS] projects provide opportunities for such learning in a functional and participatory manner. OCS is a subset of citizen science that enables volunteers to contribute to scientific investigations using the Internet. This paper describes findings from a multiple qualitative case study investigating primary studentsâ€™ perceptions of learning from an intervention where they participated in an OCS project as part of their teacherplanned classroom science programme. Students identified improved science skills, understanding about science, content-related learning, and many described possible actions to take in response to their learning. Integrating OCS into a well-planned unit appears to offer opportunities for students to weave all three strands, thus strengthening their rope of scientific literacy.",2019,
Sparse Group Inductive Matrix Completion,"We consider the problem of inductive matrix completion under the assumption that many features are non-informative, which leads to row- and column-sparse structure of coefficient matrix. Under the additional assumption on the low rank of coefficient matrix we propose the matrix factorization framework with group-lasso regularization on parameter matrices. We suggest efficient optimization algorithm for the solution of the obtained problem. From theoretical point of view, we prove the oracle generalization bound on the expected error of matrix completion. Corresponding sample complexity bounds show the benefits of the proposed approach compared to competitors in the sparse problems. The experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show the state-of-the-art efficiency of the proposed method.",2018,ArXiv
The Lasso Segment Is Required for Functional Dimerization of the Plasmodium Formin 1 FH2 Domain,"Apicomplexan parasites, such as the malaria-causing Plasmodium species, utilize a unique way of locomotion and host cell invasion. This substrate-dependent gliding motility requires rapid cycling of actin between the monomeric state and very short, unbranched filaments. Despite the crucial role of actin polymerization for the survival of the malaria parasite, the majority of Plasmodium cellular actin is present in the monomeric form. Plasmodium lacks most of the canonical actin nucleators, and formins are essentially the only candidates for this function in all Apicomplexa. The malaria parasite has two formins, containing conserved formin homology (FH) 2 and rudimentary FH1 domains. Here, we show that Plasmodium falciparum formin 1 associates with and nucleates both mammalian and Plasmodium actin filaments. Although Plasmodium profilin alone sequesters actin monomers, thus inhibiting polymerization, its monomer-sequestering activity does not compete with the nucleating activity of formin 1 at an equimolar profilin-actin ratio. We have determined solution structures of P. falciparum formin 1 FH2 domain both in the presence and absence of the lasso segment and the FH1 domain, and show that the lasso is required for the assembly of functional dimers.",2012,PLoS ONE
Scalable Bayesian Variable Selection Using Nonlocal Prior Densities in Ultrahigh-dimensional Settings.,"Bayesian model selection procedures based on nonlocal alternative prior densities are extended to ultrahigh dimensional settings and compared to other variable selection procedures using precision-recall curves. Variable selection procedures included in these comparisons include methods based on g-priors, reciprocal lasso, adaptive lasso, scad, and minimax concave penalty criteria. The use of precision-recall curves eliminates the sensitivity of our conclusions to the choice of tuning parameters. We find that Bayesian variable selection procedures based on nonlocal priors are competitive to all other procedures in a range of simulation scenarios, and we subsequently explain this favorable performance through a theoretical examination of their consistency properties. When certain regularity conditions apply, we demonstrate that the nonlocal procedures are consistent for linear models even when the number of covariates p increases sub-exponentially with the sample size n. A model selection procedure based on Zellner's g-prior is also found to be competitive with penalized likelihood methods in identifying the true model, but the posterior distribution on the model space induced by this method is much more dispersed than the posterior distribution induced on the model space by the nonlocal prior methods. We investigate the asymptotic form of the marginal likelihood based on the nonlocal priors and show that it attains a unique term that cannot be derived from the other Bayesian model selection procedures. We also propose a scalable and efficient algorithm called Simplified Shotgun Stochastic Search with Screening (S5) to explore the enormous model space, and we show that S5 dramatically reduces the computing time without losing the capacity to search the interesting region in the model space, at least in the simulation settings considered. The S5 algorithm is available in an R package BayesS5 on CRAN.",2018,Statistica Sinica

Empirical Copula in the Detection of Batch Effects,"The activation of the complex biological systems is presented by different mathematical expressions, called models, under various assumptions. One of the common modeling types in this description is the steady-state approach. In this description, we assume that the stochastic behavior of the system may not be observed under the constant volume and the temperature, and the mean change in the states of the systemâ€™s components is bigger than the variation of the states. Since this sort of the systemâ€™s representation needs less information about the actual biological activation, and majority of the collected data is more suitable for this approach with respect to its stochastic alternates, it is the most common modeling type in the presentation of the biological networks. In this study, we particularly deal with the steady-state type of model and suggest a preprocessing step for the raw data that is based on the transformation via the empirical copula. Here, we use the empirical copula, also called the normal copula, for eliminating the batch effects in the measurements so that the new data can fit the multivariate normal distribution. Then, we implement both parametric and nonparametric models in order to describe the final transformed measurements. In the description of the systems, we choose the Gaussian graphical model as the parametric modeling approach and select the probabilistic Boolean as well as the lasso-based MARS model as its correspondence under the nonparametric representation. Finally, in the analyses, we evaluate the performance of all suggested models and the effect of the empirical copula based on various accuracy measures via Monte Carlo studies.",2019,
Evaluating Imputation Algorithms for Low-Depth Genotyping-By-Sequencing (GBS) Data,"Well-powered genomic studies require genome-wide marker coverage across many individuals. For non-model species with few genomic resources, high-throughput sequencing (HTS) methods, such as Genotyping-By-Sequencing (GBS), offer an inexpensive alternative to array-based genotyping. Although affordable, datasets derived from HTS methods suffer from sequencing error, alignment errors, and missing data, all of which introduce noise and uncertainty to variant discovery and genotype calling. Under such circumstances, meaningful analysis of the data is difficult. Our primary interest lies in the issue of how one can accurately infer or impute missing genotypes in HTS-derived datasets. Many of the existing genotype imputation algorithms and software packages were primarily developed by and optimized for the human genetics community, a field where a complete and accurate reference genome has been constructed and SNP arrays have, in large part, been the common genotyping platform. We set out to answer two questions: 1) can we use existing imputation methods developed by the human genetics community to impute missing genotypes in datasets derived from non-human species and 2) are these methods, which were developed and optimized to impute ascertained variants, amenable for imputation of missing genotypes at HTS-derived variants? We selected Beagle v.4, a widely used algorithm within the human genetics community with reportedly high accuracy, to serve as our imputation contender. We performed a series of cross-validation experiments, using GBS data collected from the species Manihot esculenta by the Next Generation (NEXTGEN) Cassava Breeding Project. NEXTGEN currently imputes missing genotypes in their datasets using a LASSO-penalized, linear regression method (denoted 'glmnet'). We selected glmnet to serve as a benchmark imputation method for this reason. We obtained estimates of imputation accuracy by masking a subset of observed genotypes, imputing, and calculating the sample Pearson correlation between observed and imputed genotype dosages at the site and individual level; computation time served as a second metric for comparison. We then set out to examine factors affecting imputation accuracy, such as levels of missing data, read depth, minor allele frequency (MAF), and reference panel composition.",2016,PLoS ONE
Individual tree detection and area-based approach in retrieval of forest inventory characteristics from low-pulse airborne laser scanning data,"The two main approaches to derive forest information from small-footprint laser scanner data are the statistical area-based approach (ABA) and individual tree detection (ITD). In the present study we tested the accuracies of two ABA estimation methods, namely the k-nearest neighbour (k-NN) and a LASSO regression (LASSO) with ITD. In the estimation a practical low-pulse density (1.8/m 2 ) airborne laser scanning (ALS) dataset was used with same-date aerial photographs. The field data consisted of a test dataset of 97 plots and a modelling dataset of 236 plots. The modelling dataset included 20 plots that were used for bias calibration of forest characteristics calculated from ITD results. The root-mean-squared errors (RMSEs) for basal area, mean volume, mean height and mean diameter with ITD were 33.5%, 33.3%, 4.5% and 11.0% without calibration. The respective accuracies after calibration were 17.9%, 22.8%, 4.4% and 15.4%. With LASSO, the accuracies were 19.8%, 22.1%, 6.4% and 10.3% and with k-NN 24.6%, 25.8%, 9.1% and 13.5%. The ITD method gave as accurate results as did the ABAs when 20 plots were used in calibration.",2011,
Metabolic Regulation of Ca 2+ Handling in Permeabilized Insulinoma Cells,"Signal generation in the pancreaticscell requires metabolism of the stimulatory fuel and is accompanied by increases in oxygen consumption and intracellular free Ca2+ (Hedeskov, 1980; Matschinskyet al., 1983; Meglasson and Matschinsky, 1986; Prentki and Matschinsky, 1987). We hypothesized that fuel phosphorylation decreased the cytosolic MgATP/MgADP ratio sufficiently to stimulate O2consumption, and simultaneously reduced the activity of Ca2+ -ATPase with resulting increases in free-Ca2+ levels. To explore this hypothesis, we varied the MgATP/MgADP ratio in permeabilized RINm5F insulinoma cells that maintain a low-medium Ca2+ concentration in the presence of MgATP. Either of the following was added: (1) creatine phosphokinase plus various fixed ratios of creatine/creatine phosphate, or (2) a cell-free extract of rat skeletal muscle that exhibits spontaneous oscillatory behavior of glycolysis, and linked oscillations in the MgATP/MgADP ratio when provided with glucose and a hexokinase (Tornheim, 1979). We found that the free-Ca2+ level maintained by the permeabilized cells varied inversely with the MgATP/MgADP ratio, regardless of the mechanism used to vary MgATP/MgADP. In addition, free Ca2+ was decreased by increasing levels of orthophosphate (Pi). Ca2+ levels oscillated in phase with glycolytic oscillations and correlated closely with the MgATP/MgADP ratio. Ca2+ oscillations were evoked by increasing glucose levels from 2.5 to 10 or 20 mM in the presence of glucokinase, whereas oscillations occurred at 2.5 mM glucose in the presence of hexokinase and were unaffected by increasing the glucose concentration. These results provide the first demonstration of a link between metabolite changes and free-Ca2+ levels, and suggest a mechanism by which fuel metabolism might be coupled to activation of the Ca2+ messenger system in pancreaticÎ²cells.",1989,

On the Solution Path of Regularized Covariance Estimators,"The recently introduced condition-number-regularized covariance estimation method (CondReg) has been demonstrated to be highly useful for estimating high-dimensional covariance matrices. Unlike L1-regularized estimators, this approach has the added advantage that no sparsity assumptions are made. The regularization path of the lasso solution has received much attention in the literature. Despite their importance, the solution paths of covariance estimators however have not been considered in much detail. In this paper, we provide a complete characterization of the entire solution path of the CondReg estimator. Our characterization of the solution path has important applications as it yields fast algorithms that compute the CondReg estimates for all possible values of the regularization parameter at the same cost as that for a single fixed parameter. We present two instances of fast algorithms: the forward and the backward algorithms. These algorithms greatly speed up the cross-validation procedure that selects the optimal regularization parameter. Our new method is efficiently implemented with the R package CondReg.",2015,arXiv: Methodology
An Adaptive Bayesian Lasso Approach with Spike-and-Slab Priors to Identify Multiple Linear and Nonlinear Effects in Structural Equation Models,"In applied research, such as with motivation theories, typically many variables are theoretically implied predictors of an outcome and several interactions are assumed (e.g., Watt, 2004). However, estimation problems that might arise when several interaction and/or quadratic effects are analyzed simultaneously have not been investigated because simulation studies on interaction effects in the structural equation modeling framework have mainly focused on small models that contain single interaction effects. In this article, we show that traditional approaches can provide estimates with low accuracy when complex models are estimated. We introduce an adaptive Bayesian lasso approach with spike-and-slab priors that overcomes this problem. Using a complex model in a simulation study, we show that the parameter estimates of the proposed approach are more accurate in situations with high multicollinearity or low reliability compared with a standard Bayesian lasso approach and typical frequentist approaches (i.e....",2018,Structural Equation Modeling
A QST-based Pain Phenotype in Adults with Sickle Cell Disease: Sensitivity and Specificity of Quality Descriptors.,"BACKGROUND
We sought to refine a screening measure for discriminating a sensitized or normal sensation pain phenotype among African American adults with sickle cell disease (SCD).


OBJECTIVE
To develop scoring schemes based on sensory pain quality descriptors; evaluate their performance on classifying patients with SCD who had sensitization or normal sensation, and compare with scores on the Self-report Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (S-LANSS) and the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI).


METHODS
Participants completed PAINReportItÂ® , quantitative sensory testing (QST), S-LANSS, and NPSI. Conventional binary logistic regression and lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) regression were used to obtain two sets of weights resulting in two scores: PR-Logistic and PR-Lasso. Performance of the proposed scores and the existing scores were evaluated.


RESULTS
Lasso regression resulted in a parsimonious model with non-zero weights assigned to two neuropathic descriptors, cold and spreading. We found positive correlations between the PR-Lasso and other scores: S-LANSS (r=.22, p<.01), NPSI (r=.22, p<.01), and PR-Logistic (r=.35, p<.01). The NPSI and PR-Lasso performed similarly at different levels of required specificity and outperformed the S-LANSS and PR-Logistic at the various specificity points.


CONCLUSION
The PR-Lasso offers a way to discriminate a SCD pain phenotype.",2019,Pain practice : the official journal of World Institute of Pain
Association of rare haplotypes on ULK4 and MAP4 genes with hypertension,"Several variants have been implicated earlier on ULK4 and MAP4 genes on chromosome 3 to be associated with hypertension. As a natural follow-up step, we explore association of haplotypes in those genes. We consider the Genetic Analysis Workshop 19 real data on unrelated individuals and analyze haplotype blocks of 5 single-nucleotide polymorphisms through a sliding window approach. We apply 4 haplotype association methodsâ€”haplo.score, haplo.glm, hapassoc, and logistic Bayesian LASSO (LBL)â€”and for comparison, sequence kernel association test (SKAT) and its variants. We find several rare haplotype blocks to be associated. To get an idea about the false-positive proportions, we also analyzed the data after permuting the case-control status of individuals. We found that LBL, unlike the other methods, maintains low false-positive rates in presence of rare haplotypes. Thus, we conclude that the haplotypes found to be associated by LBL are more likely to be true positive. SKAT and its variants did not find significance on either gene.",2016,BMC Proceedings
Post-l1-penalized estimators in high-dimensional linear regression models,"In this paper we study post-penalized estimators which apply ordinary, unpenalized linear regression to the model selected by first-step penalized estimators, typically LASSO. It is well known that LASSO can estimate the regression function at nearly the oracle rate, and is thus hard to improve upon. We show that post-LASSO performs at least as well as LASSO in terms of the rate of convergence, and has the advantage of a smaller bias. Remarkably, this performance occurs even if the LASSO-based model selection 'fails' in the sense of missing some components of the 'true' regression model. By the 'true' model we mean here the best s-dimensional approximation to the regression function chosen by the oracle. Furthermore, post-LASSO can perform strictly better than LASSO, in the sense of a strictly faster rate of convergence, if the LASSO-based model selection correctly includes all components of the 'true' model as a subset and also achieves a sufficient sparsity. In the extreme case, when LASSO perfectly selects the 'true' model, the post-LASSO estimator becomes the oracle estimator. An important ingredient in our analysis is a new sparsity bound on the dimension of the model selected by LASSO which guarantees that this dimension is at most of the same order as the dimension of the 'true' model. Our rate results are non-asymptotic and hold in both parametric and nonparametric models. Moreover, our analysis is not limited to the LASSO estimator in the first step, but also applies to other estimators, for example, the trimmed LASSO, Dantzig selector, or any other estimator with good rates and good sparsity. Our analysis covers both traditional trimming and a new practical, completely data-driven trimming scheme that induces maximal sparsity subject to maintaining a certain goodness-of-fit. The latter scheme has theoretical guarantees similar to those of LASSO or post-LASSO, but it dominates these procedures as well as traditional trimming in a wide variety of experiments.",2010,
An Improved Prediction Model for Ovarian Cancer Using Urinary Biomarkers and a Novel Validation Strategy,"This study was designed to analyze urinary proteins associated with ovarian cancer (OC) and investigate the potential urinary biomarker panel to predict malignancy in women with pelvic masses. We analyzed 23 biomarkers in urine samples obtained from 295 patients with pelvic masses scheduled for surgery. The concentration of urinary biomarkers was quantitatively assessed by the xMAP bead-based multiplexed immunoassay. To identify the performance of each biomarker in predicting cancer over benign tumors, we used a repeated leave-group-out cross-validation strategy. The prediction models using multimarkers were evaluated to develop a urinary ovarian cancer panel. After the exclusion of 12 borderline tumors, the urinary concentration of 17 biomarkers exhibited significant differences between 158 OCs and 125 benign tumors. Human epididymis protein 4 (HE4), vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM), and transthyretin (TTR) were the top three biomarkers representing a higher concentration in OC. HE4 demonstrated the highest performance in all samples withOC(mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) 0.822, 95% CI: 0.772-0.869), whereas TTR showed the highest efficacy in early-stage OC (AUC 0.789, 95% CI: 0.714-0.856). Overall, HE4 was the most informative biomarker, followed by creatinine, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), and TTR using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression models. A multimarker panel consisting of HE4, creatinine, CEA, and TTR presented the best performance with 93.7% sensitivity (SN) at 70.6% specificity (SP) to predict OC over the benign tumor. This panel performed well regardless of disease status and demonstrated an improved performance by including menopausal status. In conclusion, the urinary biomarker panel with HE4, creatinine, CEA, and TTR provided promising efficacy in predicting OC over benign tumors in women with pelvic masses. It was also a non-invasive and easily available diagnostic tool.",2019,International Journal of Molecular Sciences

Identification of prognostic gene signature associated with microenvironment of lung adenocarcinoma,"Background
Lung cancer has the highest morbidity and mortality worldwide, and lung adenocarcinoma (LADC) is the most common pathological subtype. Accumulating evidence suggests the tumor microenvironment (TME) is correlated with the tumor progress and the patient's outcome. As the major components of TME, the tumor-infiltrated immune cells and stromal cells have attracted more and more attention. In this study, differentially expressed immune and stromal signature genes were used to construct a TME-related prognostic model for predicting the outcomes of LADC patients.


Methods
The expression profiles of LADC samples with clinical information were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to the TME of LADC were identified using TCGA dataset by Wilcoxon rank sum test. The prognostic effects of TME-related DEGs were analyzed using univariate Cox regression. Then, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was performed to reduce the overfit and the number of genes for further analysis. Next, the prognostic model was constructed by step multivariate Cox regression and risk score of each sample was calculated. Then, survival and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analyses were conducted to validate the model using TCGA and GEO datasets, respectively. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis of gene signature was performed using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). Finally, the overall immune status, tumor purity and the expression profiles of HLA genes of high- and low-risk samples was further analyzed to reveal the potential mechanisms of prognostic effects of the model.


Results
A total of 93 TME-related DEGs were identified, of which 23 DEGs were up-regulated and 70 DEGs were down-regulated. The univariate cox analysis indicated that 23 DEGs has the prognostic effects, the hazard ratio ranged from 0.65 to 1.25 (p < 0.05). Then, seven genes were screened out from the 23 DEGs by LASSO regression method and were further analyzed by step multivariate Cox regression. Finally, a three-gene (ADAM12, Bruton Tyrosine KinaseÂ (BTK), ERG) signature was constructed, and ADAM12, BTK can be used as independent prognostic factors. The three-gene signature well stratified the LADC patients in both training (TCGA) and testing (GEO) datasets as high-risk and low-risk groups, the 3-year area under curve (AUC) of ROC curves of three GEO sets were 0.718Â (GSE3141), 0.646Â (GSE30219) and 0.643Â (GSE50081).Â The GSEA analysis indicated that highly expressed ADAM12, BTK, ERG mainly correlated with the activation of pathways involving in focal adhesion, immune regulation. The immune analysis indicated that the low-risk group has more immune activities and higher expression of HLA genes than that of the high-risk group. In sum, we identified and constructed a three TME-related DEGs signature, which could be used to predict the prognosis of LADC patients.",2019,PeerJ
Possible relationship between common genetic variation and white matter development in a pilot study of preterm infants,"BACKGROUND
The consequences of preterm birth are a major public health concern with high rates of ensuing multisystem morbidity, and uncertain biological mechanisms. Common genetic variation may mediate vulnerability to the insult of prematurity and provide opportunities to predict and modify risk.


OBJECTIVE
To gain novel biological and therapeutic insights from the integrated analysis of magnetic resonance imaging and genetic data, informed by prior knowledge.


METHODS
We apply our previously validated pathway-based statistical method and a novel network-based method to discover sources of common genetic variation associated with imaging features indicative of structural brain damage.


RESULTS
Lipid pathways were highly ranked by Pathways Sparse Reduced Rank Regression in a model examining the effect of prematurity, and PPAR (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor) signaling was the highest ranked pathway once degree of prematurity was accounted for. Within the PPAR pathway, five genes were found by Graph Guided Group Lasso to be highly associated with the phenotype: aquaporin 7 (AQP7), malic enzyme 1, NADP(+)-dependent, cytosolic (ME1), perilipin 1 (PLIN1), solute carrier family 27 (fatty acid transporter), member 1 (SLC27A1), and acetyl-CoA acyltransferase 1 (ACAA1). Expression of four of these (ACAA1, AQP7, ME1, and SLC27A1) is controlled by a common transcription factor, early growth response 4 (EGR-4).


CONCLUSIONS
This suggests an important role for lipid pathways in influencing development of white matter in preterm infants, and in particular a significant role for interindividual genetic variation in PPAR signaling.",2016,Brain and Behavior
'A Lovely Land ... by Shadows Dark Untainted'?: Whiteness and Early Queensland Women's Writing,"This paper examines the formative but largely forgotten years of white women's writing, from the establishment of the colony of Queensland in 1859 until 1939, the year in which the assimilation policy was adopted across Australia. It examines whiteness in this body of literature as a discourse that both draws upon, and helps to shape, the experience of women writers and readers as members of a recently established white colony. An ideology of whiteness underpins this work, but its formulation is neither monolithic nor static: from the beginning there are divergent tendencies, and significant new trends emerge in the 1920s as the assimilation project begins to take hold of the literary imagination. This literature tells us very little about the racial Others with which it is so preoccupied, but a great deal about the lived experience of whiteness by women in early Queensland, as well as the ways in which literary culture articulated whiteness as the centrally cohesive factor in constructing a new white nation in the Antipodes. White women writers position themselves as leaders of public opinion, articulating responses to changing preoccupations and social debates. The differences between genres are striking. Celebration of whiteness and expressions of virulent racial hatred tend to characterise poetry, while fiction generates a more complex exploration of what it means to be an author and agent of colonisation. The fictional tradition, initiated by Rosa Praed in the late nineteenth century and continued by Zora Cross, Mabel Forrest, Dorothy Cottrell and Kay Glasson Taylor in the 1920s and 1930s, is of particular interest because it explores 'dying race' and assimilation debates in the lead-up to the formal adoption of assimilation in 1939, from the point of view of women who had lived in the contact zone. Unease with the experience of racial interaction and, more generally, with women's participation in colonisation sporadically ripples the surface of fictional narratives, but such eruptions ultimately fail to unsettle the ideology of whiteness. Since World War II, the tension between these two approaches has been developed and transformed creatively by white women such as Judith Wright, Thea Astley and Janette Turner Hospital, along with Indigenous writers such as Oodgeroo Noonuccal and Melissa Lucashenko.",2004,
The Neutron and its Properties,"The subject of my lecture, the neutron and its properties, has at present no professional applications for the radiologist, but it has some points of general interest apart from its mere novelty. The conception of a neutral particle is not new. It was suggested by Rutherford in 1920 that a proton and an electron might unite much more intimately than they are combined in the hydrogen atom and so form a particle of a new type, which would have peculiar and interesting properties. The suggestion was made partly because such a particle would be the first step in the formation of atomic nuclei from the two units, the proton and the electron, and partly also to make it possible to understand how complex nuclei can be gradually built up from simpler ones. Experiments were made in 1921 by the late Professor Glasson and by Roberts to detect the formation of such neutrons when an electric discharge was passed through hydrogen, but with negative results. The possibility that such a particle might exist was, neverthe...",1933,British Journal of Radiology
Minimizing Nonconvex Non-Separable Functions,"Regularization has played a key role in deriving sensible estimators in high dimensional statistical inference. A substantial amount of recent works has argued for nonconvex regularizers in favor of their superior theoretical properties and excellent practical performances. In a dierent but analogous vein, nonconvex loss functions are promoted because of their robustness against \outliers"". However, these nonconvex formulations are computationally more challenging, especially in the presence of nonsmoothness and nonseparability. To address this issue, we propose a new proximal gradient meta-algorithm by rigorously extending the proximal average to the nonconvex setting. We formally prove its nice convergence properties, and illustrate its eectiveness on two applications: multi-task graph-guided fused lasso and robust support vector machines. Experiments demonstrate that our method compares favorably against other alternatives.",2015,

The Effects of Political Institutions on the Extensive and Intensive Margins of Trade,"We present a model of political networks that integrates both the choice of trade partners (the extensive margin) and trade volumes (the intensive margin). Our model predicts that regimes secure in their survival, including democracies as well as some consolidated authoritarian regimes, will trade more on the extensive margin than vulnerable autocracies, which will block trade in products that would expand interpersonal contact among their citizens. We apply a two-stage Bayesian LASSO estimator to detailed measures of institutional features and highly disaggregated product-level trade data encompassing 131 countries over a half century. Consistent with our model, we find that (a) political institutions matter for the extensive margin of trade but not for the intensive margin and (b) the effects of political institutions on the extensive margin of trade vary across products, falling most heavily on those goods that involve extensive interpersonal contact.",2019,International Organization
Using the lasso method for space-time short-term wind speed predictions,"Accurate wind power forecasts depend on reliable wind speed forecasts. Numerical Weather Predictions (NWPs) utilize huge amounts of computing time, but still have rather low spatial and temporal resolution. However, stochastic wind speed forecasts perform well in rather high temporal resolution settings. They consume comparably little computing resources and return reliable forecasts, if forecasting horizons are not too long. In the recent literature, spatial interdependence is increasingly taken into consideration. In this paper we propose a new and quite flexible multivariate model that accounts for neighbouring weather stationsâ€™ information and as such, exploits spatial data at a high resolution. The model is applied to forecasting horizons of up to one day and is capable of handling a high resolution temporal structure. We use a periodic vector autoregressive model with seasonal lags to account for the interaction of the explanatory variables. Periodicity is considered and modelled by cubic B-splines. Due to the modelâ€™s flexibility, the amount of explanatory variables becomes huge. Therefore, we utilize a time-saving lasso method for estimation. Particularly, a relatively newly developed iteratively reweighted lasso is applied that also incorporates heteroscedasticity. We compare our model to several benchmarks. One of them is the somewhat more advanced ARFIMA(p,d,q)APARCH(P,Q) process. The results show that the exploitation of spatial information and the re-weighted lasso method increases the forecasting accuracy tremendously, in comparison to models in use so far.",2015,arXiv: Applications
Hybrid Regularization with Elastic Net and Linear Discriminant Analysis for Zero-Shot Image Recognition,"Zero-shot learning (ZSL) is the process of recognizing unseen samples from their related classes. Generally, ZSL is realized with the help of some pre-defined semantic information via projecting high dimensional visual features of data samples and class-related semantic vectors into a common embedding space. Although classification can be simply decided through the nearest-neighbor strategy, it usually suffers from problems of domain shift and hubness. In order to address these challenges, majority of researches have introduced regularization with some existing norms, such as lasso or ridge, to constrain the learned embedding. However, the sparse estimation of lasso may cause underfitting of training data, while ridge may introduce bias in the embedding space. In order to resolve these problems, this paper proposes a novel hybrid regularization approach by leveraging elastic net and linear discriminant analysis, and formulates a unified objective function that can be solved efficiently via a synchronous optimization strategy. The proposed method is evaluated on several benchmark image datasets for the task of generalized ZSL. The obtained results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over simple regularized methods as well as several previous models.",2019,2019 IEEE Visual Communications and Image Processing (VCIP)

Failure analysis of a martensitic stainless steel (CA-15M) roll manufactured by centrifugal casting. Part I: Material and fractographic characterization,"abstract The failure analysis of a martensitic stainless steel (CA-15M) roll manufactured by centrif-ugal casting and used in cast glass rolling was carried out by means of traditional charac-terization techniques (optical metallography, SEM, EDX microanalysis, tensile testing andXRD). The roll was in the as-cast condition and its microstructure featured large proportionof dferrite (between 20% and 27%) in a martensitic ( a 0 ) matrix, with the d/ a 0 interfaces pre-senting an intergranular network of M 23 C 6 carbides. The crack propagation began in theinternal surface of the roll, with d/ a 0 intergranular and transgranular cleavage in the â€˜â€˜equi-axed regionâ€™â€™ of the casting, progressing to d/ a 0 intergranular ductile fracture in the â€˜â€˜colum-narâ€™â€™ and â€˜â€˜chilled regionsâ€™â€™. Tensile thermal stresses in the internal surface of the rollassociated with microstructural embrittlement (network of interfacial carbide and micro-porosities) are thought to be the main causes for the premature failure of the roll. Finally,materials selection was performed to replace the CA-15M stainless steel with another classof stainless steel for centrifugal casting. 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Title Disparities in children ' s vocabulary and height in relation to household wealth and parental schooling : A longitudinal study in four low-and middle-income countries,"Introduction Optimal development in early childhood is associated with better health, cognitive and language development, and achievement, concurrently and later in life (Grantham-McGregor et al., 2007; Hoddinott, Alderman, Behrman, Haddad, & Horton, 2013; Martorell et al., 2010; Victora et al., 2008). More than 250 million children under 5y are at risk for not meeting their developmental potential due to living in extreme poverty and/or because they have experienced linear growth retardation (stunting) (Black et al., 2016; Lu, Black, & Richter, 2016); direct measures of cognitive child development have confirmed the magnitude of the problem (McCoy et al., 2016). Children living in poverty receive fewer householdand community-level investments (e.g., nutrition, health, education, and responsive stimulation) than children who do not live in poverty (Engle et al., 2011; Walker, Wachs et al. 2011). For these reasons, among others, the United Nations has http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmph.2017.08.008 Received 16 February 2017; Received in revised form 7 August 2017; Accepted 21 August 2017 âŽ Corresponding author.

MARK included reducing inequality within and among countries as a key Sustainable Development Goal (Nino, 2016). Developmental disparities between children from lower and higher socio-economic status (SES) households persist into adulthood. In lowand middle-income countries, child height is associated with adult skills, marriage partner quality, and labor market outcomes (Hoddinott, Alderman et al., 2013, Hoddinott, Behrman et al., 2013a). Better early cognitive skills, including those related to language, are associated with higher labor market earnings and lower levels of risky behavior later in life (Gertler et al., 2014; Heckman, Stixrud, & Urzua, 2006; Walker, Chang, Vera-HernÃ¡ndez, & Grantham-McGregor, 2011). Thus, investing in children through a range of interventions can affect childrenâ€™s cognitive and physical development, and can have long-term implications in many other domains (Britto et al., 2016; Hoddinott, Maluccio, Behrman, Flores, &Martorell, 2008). While the persistence of health and cognitive disparities has been well-documented in high-income countries (Bradley & Corwyn, 2002; Case, Lubotsky, & Paxson, 2002; Pavalko & Caputo, 2013), less longitudinal research has been done in lowor middle-income countries. Most literature to date has relied on cross-sectional data, requiring strong assumptions to be made in drawing inferences about changes with age. Moreover, existing studies often capture a limited age range (Fernald, Kariger, Hidrobo, & Gertler, 2012; Fernald, Weber, Galasso, & Ratsifandrihamanana, 2011; Ghuman, Behrman, Borja, Gultiano, & King, 2005; Paxson & Schady, 2007; Rubio-Codina, Attanasio, Meghir, Varela, & Grantham-McGregor, 2015a). Evidence from Colombia, the country with the widest age-range we found to have been studied cross-sectionally, supports the hypothesis that disparities in vocabulary initially widen with age but the supposed widening may halt in later childhood, as the disparities at 8.5y are of a similar magnitude to those at 4.5y (Bernal & Van Der Werf, 2011; Rubio-Codina, Attanasio, Meghir, Varela, & Grantham-McGregor, 2015b). The limited available longitudinal research supports these crosssectional findings. Data from Bangladesh (following children from age 0 until 5y) (Hamadani et al., 2014), Ecuador (following children from 3â€“5y until 10â€“12y) (Schady et al., 2015), Madagascar (following children 3â€“6y until 7â€“10y) (Galasso, Weber, & Fernald, 2017), Nicaragua (following children 3â€“6y until 6â€“9y) (Macours, Schady, & Vakis, 2012), and the Young Lives countries (Ethiopia, India, Peru, and Vietnam, following children from 5y until 8y) (Lopez Boo, 2016) provide some additional evidence that SES-related differences in cognitive child development scores increase throughout early childhood, flatten around 5â€“7y, and are constant through the remaining pre-pubertal years. We are aware of only three studies that engage in cross-country comparisons. These studies apply the same method in differing contexts, an advantage over comparing multiple, individual-county studies. In one cross-sectional analysis looking at disparities in early child development in India, Indonesia, Peru and Senegal, within-country differences in length-for-age and child development scores by SES are evident as early as 3â€“23mo (Fernald et al., 2012). Findings from another study of children 3â€“6y in five Latin American countries (some with cross-sectional data and some with longitudinal data) align with the hypothesis that disparities in vocabulary widen at early ages, with little further change once children are in elementary school (Schady et al., 2015). A final longitudinal study examines children from the Young Lives Study Countries (Ethiopia, India, Peru and Vietnam) at 5 and 8y, and finds the magnitude of within-country SES differences in vocabulary to persist over time (Lopez Boo, 2016). Each paper finds consistent patterns but the sizes of the SES disparities vary by country. The existing literature implies that vocabulary disparities attributable to SES widen in early childhood and persist into middle childhood, though this hypothesis has not been directly tested. Furthermore, most of the extant studies do not address disparities in height after early childhood. Stunting had been thought to be determined by 2â€“3y (Victora et al., 2008); however, recent research from the Young Lives Study indicates that HAZ may be influenced by SES as late as 8y (Lundeen et al., 2014; Schott, Crookston, Lundeen, Stein, & Behrman, 2013) and is associated with improved cognitive outcomes in children who experience growth recovery compared to children who are persistently stunted (Crookston et al., 2013). Data from rural Gambia further illustrates increases in HAZ in adolescence (Prentice et al., 2013). Variation in adult height is strongly predicted by growth in the first years of life (Stein et al., 2010), and there is limited evidence of potential for nutritional interventions to impact on linear growth when delivered after age 2y (Roberts & Stein, 2017). Thus identifying common underlying determinants of disparities in growth and cognitive achievement is of value because, while sharing some important inputs like nutrition, they are not perfectly correlated and height and vocabulary are both associated with schooling, economic productivity, health and other outcomes later in the life cycle (Britto et al., 2016). Our study extends the existing research, in particular building on the cross-country Young Lives Study (Lopez Boo, 2016). Our objective is to contribute to the literature with a longitudinal description of childhood disparities in height and vocabulary (a measure of cognitive achievement) associated with two measures of SES (household wealth and parental schooling). Height data are available at 1, 5, 8 and 12y and vocabulary data are available at 5, 8, and 12y. We hypothesize that SES-related disparities in height will widen between 1 and 5y and that SES-related disparities in both height and vocabulary will remain constant from 5 to 12y. Since many studies confirm that household and community covariates account for much of these SES gaps (Fernald et al., 2012, 2011; Hamadani et al., 2014; Lopez Boo, 2014; RubioCodina et al., 2015a), in a non-causal analysis we describe the extent to which these covariates at age 1y account for the size of the SES-related disparities at 12y. Methods Data We analyze data from the Young Lives Study, which recruited children in each of four countries (Ethiopia, India, Peru, and Vietnam) in 2002 (Barnett et al., 2013). The present analysis uses data from the younger cohort, who were between 6.0 and 17.9 months at recruitment (mean 11.7 months). Follow-up data were collected in 2006 (mean 5.3y), in 2009 (mean 7.9y), and in 2013 (mean 12.0y). We refer to the survey rounds as ages 1, 5, 8 and 12, respectively. In each of the study countries, participants were selected through a multi-stage sampling process beginning with 20 sentinel sites that were purposively selected to reflect the Young Lives studyâ€™s aims of examining the causes and consequences of childhood poverty and diversity of childhood experiences. In India, recruitment was restricted to the state of Andhra Pradesh, which subsequently divided into two states, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Within each sentinel site, approximately 100 children within the eligible age category were randomly sampled (â€œYoung Lives methods guide,â€ 2017). Less than 2% of selected households refused to participate. There was one study child per household. Comparisons with children in the nationally-representative Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) found the Young Lives samples to cover a broad diversity of children within each country (â€œYoung Lives methods guide,â€ 2017).

"The early life history of labroid fishes at Lizard Island, Northern Great Barrier Reef","Adult labrids showed distinctive patterns of distribution and abundance among habitat zones at Lizard Island, which were consistent in space (among sites) and time (annually and seasonally). Patterns of labrid abundance and diversity among habitats were not clearly influenced by substrate characteristics such as percent live cover, substrate diversity and complexity. However depth was an important factor influencing habitat use, with 7 abundant species present in higher densities in either shallow (Halichoeres spp., Stethojulis bandanensis, Thalassoma hardwicke and T. jansenii) or deep habitats (Cons schroederi, H. melanurus, T. lunare). Only one abundant species, Labroides dimidiatus was ubiquitous at all depths. Most species used the same habitat zones at different life history stages (adults and recruits), suggesting that patterns of distribution and abundance of adults were determined by recruitment patterns at this scale. In contrast, two species (Labroides dimidiatus and Thalassoma lunare) showed ontogenetic shifts in habitat use, indicating that their recruitment patterns were modified by post-settlement processes. 
 
Labroid recruits (labrids and scarids) also showed distinctive patterns of distribution and abundance among microhabitats within. 2 zones (Reef Base and Sand Flat). Three abundant taxa: 2 labrids (Coris schroederi and Halichoeres melanurus) and a group of scarids (Scares spp.), were present in significantly higher densities within stands of macroalgae in territories of two herbivorous damselfish (Dischistodus prosopotaenia and D. perspicillatus) than they were in adjacent microhabitats (reef matrix and rubble/sand patches). The territories provided excellent replicate units of habitat for studying the early life history of these species. Many rare species were also most abundant in the territories. 
 
Each damselfish species facilitated the growth of macroalgae within their territories by excluding trophic competitors and disruptive carnivores. The territories of D. prosopotaenia were established on the reef matrix/sand interface at the bottom of the slope, and were characterised by multispecific stands of green, red and brown algae. D. perspicillatus territories were established on sand on the sand flat, and were characterised by a monospecific stand of blue-green algae. In contrast to the territories, adjacent microhabitats were almost devoid of macroalgae. Both damselfish species were abundant and occurred in large aggregations ( >20 individuals), where territories covered > 20% of large areas ( > 250mÂ²). The result was that recruitment of these labroids to large areas with damselfish aggregations, was significantly higher than to adjacent areas without aggregations. 
 
C. schroederi and Scarus spp. used both types of territories in high densities, while H. melanurus was only present in high densities in D. prosopotaenia territories. A manipulative experiment using artificial territories indicated that H. melanurus may have discriminated between the territories on the basis of their microhabitat characteristics, rather than their location on the reef profile. However further manipulative studies are required to test this hypothesis. 
 
Labrids which used the territories heavily as recruits did so at different times of the summer. Scarids used them most heavily in the early summer, C. schroederi used them in mid-summer and H. melanurus used them in late summer. These recruitment patterns were spatially (among sites) and temporally (between years) consistent, and probably decreased the possibility of inter-specific interactions between labroid recruits during, the first few weeks of benthic life. 
 
Scarid recruits used the territories for only a few weeks before they were evicted by the resident damselfish. This coincided with the size at which they became herbivores and trophic competitors to the damselfish. In contrast, the carnivorous labrids continued to use territories heavily throughout their lives, with adults of one species (C. schroederi) spending >50% of their time within territories. This behaviour appeared to be tolerated by the resident damselfish, which only attacked them on rare occasions. 
 
Living within territories had no negative effects on diet, growth or survivorship of C. schroederi and H. melanurus recruits during the first 2 months of benthic life, despite their high densities. This was probably because resources (food and shelter) were also much higher in territories than in other microhabitats. The result was that patterns of higher overall recruitment to areas with damselfish aggregations were either reinforced or unchanged by early post-settlement processes, which suggested that sizes of adult populations of these species should have been higher in the vicinity of territories than in adjacent areas without territories. However this was not the case, suggesting that processes operating after the first 2 months of benthic life modified spatial patterns of recruitment. One possibility was that some individuals may have moved out of areas with damselfish aggregations onto adjacent areas where aggregations were absent. These results suggest that damselfish aggregations act as focal sites for labroid recruitment, which may result in higher local abundances of some labroids, both in areas with damselfish aggregations and adjacent reefal areas.",1994,
Genomeâ€wide association studies using a penalized movingâ€window regression,"Motivation: Genomeâ€wide association studies (GWAS) have played an important role in identifying genetic variants underlying human complex traits. However, its success is hindered by weak effect at causal variants and presence of noise at nonâ€causal variants. In an effort to overcome these difficulties, a previous study proposed a regularized regression method that penalizes on the difference of signal strength between two consecutive singleâ€nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Results: We provide a generalization to the aforeâ€mentioned method so that more adjacent SNPs can be incorporated. The choice of optimal number of SNPs is studied. Simulation studies indicate that when consecutive SNPs have similar absolute coefficients our method performs better than using LASSO penalty. In other situations, our method is still comparable to using LASSO penalty. The practical utility of the proposed method is demonstrated by applying it to Genetic Analysis Workshop 16 rheumatoid arthritis GWAS data. Availability and implementation: An implementation of the proposed method is provided in R package MWLasso. Contact: kaiâ€wang@uiowa.edu",2017,Bioinformatics
Survival prediction from clinico-genomic models - a comparative study,"BackgroundSurvival prediction from high-dimensional genomic data is an active field in today's medical research. Most of the proposed prediction methods make use of genomic data alone without considering established clinical covariates that often are available and known to have predictive value. Recent studies suggest that combining clinical and genomic information may improve predictions, but there is a lack of systematic studies on the topic. Also, for the widely used Cox regression model, it is not obvious how to handle such combined models.ResultsWe propose a way to combine classical clinical covariates with genomic data in a clinico-genomic prediction model based on the Cox regression model. The prediction model is obtained by a simultaneous use of both types of covariates, but applying dimension reduction only to the high-dimensional genomic variables. We describe how this can be done for seven well-known prediction methods: variable selection, unsupervised and supervised principal components regression and partial least squares regression, ridge regression, and the lasso. We further perform a systematic comparison of the performance of prediction models using clinical covariates only, genomic data only, or a combination of the two. The comparison is done using three survival data sets containing both clinical information and microarray gene expression data. Matlab code for the clinico-genomic prediction methods is available at http://www.med.uio.no/imb/stat/bmms/software/clinico-genomic/.ConclusionsBased on our three data sets, the comparison shows that established clinical covariates will often lead to better predictions than what can be obtained from genomic data alone. In the cases where the genomic models are better than the clinical, ridge regression is used for dimension reduction. We also find that the clinico-genomic models tend to outperform the models based on only genomic data. Further, clinico-genomic models and the use of ridge regression gives for all three data sets better predictions than models based on the clinical covariates alone.",2009,BMC Bioinformatics
Pattern recognition approach to assess the residual structural capacity of damaged tall buildings,"Abstract A pattern recognition approach is proposed to quantitatively assess the residual structural capacity of earthquake-damaged tall buildings. Sequential nonlinear response history analyses using as-recorded mainshock-aftershock ground motions are conducted to generate distinct feature patterns comprised of spatially distributed global and local engineering demand parameters (EDP) within the tall building. Residual structural capacity is assessed based on the median spectral intensity corresponding to the collapse prevention performance level. Dispersion-based filtering and feature selection using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selector Operator (LASSO) are performed to effectively reduce the high dimensional feature space while selecting the most informative ones. The features that survive the filtering but excluded by LASSO are reserved and grouped based on their correlations with those that are selected. These reserved features can be utilized if the selected ones are unavailable. Predictive models using Support Vector Machine are constructed to map the EDP-based features to the residual structural capacity of the tall building, where satisfactory performance is observed as measured by the root mean square errors in the testing dataset. In addition to guiding post-earthquake inspections and residual structural capacity assessments, the proposed framework can inform optimal sensor placement as well as provide time-dependent limit state evaluation in aftershock environments.",2019,Structural Safety
"Integration of transcriptomics and metabonomics: improving diagnostics, biomarker identification and phenotyping in ulcerative colitis","A systems biology approach to multi-faceted diseases has provided an opportunity to establish a holistic understanding of the processes at play. Thus, the current study merges transcriptomics and metabonomics data in order to improve diagnostics, biomarker identification and to explore the possibilities of a molecular phenotyping of ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. Biopsies were obtained from the descending colon of 43 UC patients (22 active UC and 21 quiescent UC) and 15 controls. Genome-wide gene expression analyses were performed using Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0. Metabolic profiles were generated using 1 H Nuclear magnetic reso- nance spectroscopy (Bruker 600 MHz, Bruker BioSpin, Rheinstetten, Germany). Data were analyzed with the use of orthogonal-projection to latent structure-discriminant analysis and a multivariate logistic regression model fitted by lasso. Prediction performance was evaluated using nested Monte Carlo cross-validation. The prediction per- formance of the merged data sets and that of relative small (\20 variables) multivariate biomarker panels suggest that it is possible to discriminate between active UC, quiescent UC, and controls; between patients with or without steroid dependency, as well as between early or late disease onset. Consequently, this study demonstrates that the novel approach of integrating metabonomics and transcriptomics combines the better of the two worlds, and provides us with clinical applicable candidate biomarker panels. These combined panels improve diagnostics and more impor- tantly also the molecular phenotyping in UC and provide insight into the pathophysiological processes at play, making optimized and personalized medication a possibility.",2014,
Representing Urban Forms: A Collective Learning Model with Heterogeneous Human Mobility Data,"Human mobility data refers to records of human movements, such as cellphone traces, vehicle GPS trajectories, geo-tagged posts, and photos. While successfully mining human mobility data can benefit many applications such as city planning, transportation, urban economics, and public safety, it is very challenging to model large-scale Heterogeneous Human Mobility Data (HHMD) that are generated from different resources. In this paper, we develop a general collective learning approach to model HHMD at an individual level towards identifying and quantifying the urban forms of residential communities. Specifically, our proposed method exploits two geographic regularities among HHMD. First, we jointly capture the correlations among residential communities, urban functions, temporal effects, and user mobility patterns by analogizing communities as documents and mobility patterns as words. Also, we further combine explicit LASSO analysis and significant testing into latent representation learning as a regularization term by analogizing compatible Point-of-Interests (POIs) as the meta-data of communities. In this way, we can learn the urban forms, including a mix of functions and corresponding portfolios, of residential communities from HHDM and POIs. We further leverage these learned results to address two application problems: real estate ranking and restaurant popularity prediction. Finally, we conduct intensive evaluations with a variety of real-world data, where experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed modeling method and its successful applications for other problems.",2019,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering

MRM-Lasso: A Sparse Multiview Feature Selection Method via Low-Rank Analysis,"Learning about multiview data involves many applications, such as video understanding, image classification, and social media. However, when the data dimension increases dramatically, it is important but very challenging to remove redundant features in multiview feature selection. In this paper, we propose a novel feature selection algorithm, multiview rank minimization-based Lasso (MRM-Lasso), which jointly utilizes Lasso for sparse feature selection and rank minimization for learning relevant patterns across views. Instead of simply integrating multiple Lasso from view level, we focus on the performance of sample-level (sample significance) and introduce pattern-specific weights into MRM-Lasso. The weights are utilized to measure the contribution of each sample to the labels in the current view. In addition, the latent correlation across different views is successfully captured by learning a low-rank matrix consisting of pattern-specific weights. The alternating direction method of multipliers is applied to optimize the proposed MRM-Lasso. Experiments on four real-life data sets show that features selected by MRM-Lasso have better multiview classification performance than the baselines. Moreover, pattern-specific weights are demonstrated to be significant for learning about multiview data, compared with view-specific weights.",2015,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems
Differential expression analysis with global network adjustment,"BackgroundLarge-scale chromosomal deletions or other non-specific perturbations of the transcriptome can alter the expression of hundreds or thousands of genes, and it is of biological interest to understand which genes are most profoundly affected. We present a method for predicting a geneâ€™s expression as a function of other genes thereby accounting for the effect of transcriptional regulation that confounds the identification of genes differentially expressed relative to a regulatory network. The challenge in constructing such models is that the number of possible regulator transcripts within a global network is on the order of thousands, and the number of biological samples is typically on the order of 10. Nevertheless, there are large gene expression databases that can be used to construct networks that could be helpful in modeling transcriptional regulation in smaller experiments.ResultsWe demonstrate a type of penalized regression model that can be estimated from large gene expression databases, and then applied to smaller experiments. The ridge parameter is selected by minimizing the cross-validation error of the predictions in the independent out-sample. This tends to increase the model stability and leads to a much greater degree of parameter shrinkage, but the resulting biased estimation is mitigated by a second round of regression. Nevertheless, the proposed computationally efficient â€œover-shrinkageâ€ method outperforms previously used LASSO-based techniques. In two independent datasets, we find that the median proportion of explained variability in expression is approximately 25%, and this results in a substantial increase in the signal-to-noise ratio allowing more powerful inferences on differential gene expression leading to biologically intuitive findings. We also show that a large proportion of gene dependencies are conditional on the biological state, which would be impossible with standard differential expression methods.ConclusionsBy adjusting for the effects of the global network on individual genes, both the sensitivity and reliability of differential expression measures are greatly improved.",2013,BMC Bioinformatics

Sparse Gaussian Process Regression via L1 Penalization,"To handle massive data, a variety of sparse Gaussian Process (GP) methods have been proposed to reduce the computational cost. Many of them essentially map the large dataset into a small set of basis points. A common approach to learn these basis points is evidence maximization. Nevertheless, evidence maximization may lead to overfitting and cause a high computational cost. In this paper, we propose a novel sparse GP regression approach, GPLasso, that explicitly represents the trade-off between its approximation quality and the model sparsity. GPLasso minimizes a l1-penalized KL divergence between the exact and sparse GP posterior processes. Optimizing this convex cost function leads to sparse GP parameters. Furthermore, we use incomplete Cholesky factorization to obtain low-rank matrix approximations to speed up the optimization procedure. Experimental results on synthetic and real data demonstrate that, compared with several state-of-the-art sparse GP methods and a direct low-rank matrix approximation method, GPLasso achieves a significantly improved trade-off between prediction accuracy and computational cost.",2010,
"Another view on late Antiquity: Sagalassos (SW Anatolia), its suburbium and its countryside in late Antiquity","Summary. Survey evidence gathered in the city of Sagalassos (Pisidia, SW Turkey), its suburbs and its countryside has led to new insights into developments in the region in late antiquity. Coupled with the results from excavations, soundings, and interdisciplinary research, a reconstruction can be made of what happened during the last centuries of the cityâ€™s existence. Framing the observed changes in a larger chronological perspective, another view emerges on the fate of the city and its countryside in late antiquity. Terms such as â€˜declineâ€™, â€˜fallâ€™, and â€˜transformationâ€™ relate to cities and do not adequately describe the contemporary evolution in the countryside. An urgent call for rural surveys is advocated to avoid the perpetuation of the intellectual trap created by this urban-centred approach. SAGALASSOS AND ITS TERRITORY ARE located in the western Taurus Mountains, c.100 km north of the southern coast of Turkey, in what in ancient times was known as Pisidia (Figs G and 1.). The cityâ€™s remains extend over a c.80-ha undulating platform on the southern flank of the Ag Ë˜lasun Mountains, 7 km north of the modern-day village of Ag Ë˜lasun in the Turkish province of Burdur. At its apex in imperial times, the cityâ€™s territory extended over c.1,800 square km, encompassing a region stretching from lake Burdur at its western extent, east to the river Aksu, and from north to south from the Akdag Ë˜ to the hills south of the plains of Celtikci and Bag Ë˜saray (Waelkens et al. 1997a, 97â€“9; Waelkens et al. 2000a, 40, 175â€“6, 187â€“8, 211).",2007,
Optimizing Location of Car-Sharing Stations Based on Potential Travel Demand and Present Operation Characteristics: The Case of Chengdu,"Car-sharing is becoming an increasingly popular travel mode in China and many companies invest plenty of money on that including vehicle enterprises and Internet companies. But most of them build car-sharing stations by their experience or randomly as long as there is parking space in the early development of their business. This results in many stations with low operational efficiency and causes capital loss. This study aims to use different data source with statistical models and machine learning algorithm to help car-sharing operator to choose the optimal location of new stations and adjust the location of existing stations. We select Chengdu where there are huge amounts of car-sharing travel demand and several large car-sharing operators as the research area and two main operators as the research objects. Chengdu is divided into 58724 squared grids each of which is 0.5kmâŽ0.5km instead of focusing on the buffers generated by stations. We try to find a model to estimate a potential travel demand value for each small grid with three data sources: order data, population data, and Point of Interest (POI) data. This problem is transformed into a binary form and five different methods, Logistic Regression, Logistic Regression with LASSO, Naive Bayes, Linear Discriminant Analysis, and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, are implemented. The optimal model, Logistic Regression with LASSO, is chosen to estimate the probability of existence of demand in all grids. With car-sharing order data from different operators, an existing order heat value is also computed for each grid. Then we analyze and classify all the grids into four groups. For different groups of grids, we give different suggestions on the optimal location of stations. This study focuses on a more competitive market and finds the influential factors on order number. Suggestions on the optimal location of stations are given in consideration of competitors. We hope that our research can help operators improve their business and make rational plans.",2019,Journal of Advanced Transportation
