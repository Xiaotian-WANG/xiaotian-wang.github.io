Construction and Validation of an Autophagy-Related Prognostic Risk Signature for Survival Predicting in Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma Patients,"Background: Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is a common type of malignant tumors in urinary system. Evaluating the prognostic outcome at the time of initial diagnosis is essential for patients. Autophagy is known to play a significant role in tumors. Here, we attempted to construct an autophagy-related prognostic risk signature based on the expression profile of autophagy-related genes (ARGs) for predicting the long-term outcome and effect of precise treatments for ccRCC patients. Methods: We obtained the expression profile of ccRCC from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) database and extract the portion of ARGs. We conducted differentially expressed analysis on ARGs and then performed enrichment analyses to confirm the anomalous autophagy-related biological functions. Then, we performed univariate Cox regression to screen out overall survival (OS)-related ARGs. With these genes, we established an autophagy-related risk signature by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression. We validated the reliability of the risk signature with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, survival analysis, clinic correlation analysis, and Cox regression. Then we analyzed the function of each gene in the signature by single-gene gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Finally, we analyzed the correlation between our risk score and expression level of several targets of immunotherapy and targeted therapy. Results: We established a seven-gene prognostic risk signature, according to which we could divide patients into high or low risk groups and predict their outcomes. ROC analysis and survival analysis validated the reliability of the signature. Clinic correlation analysis found that the risk group is significantly correlated with severity of ccRCC. Multivariate Cox regression revealed that the risk score could act as an independent predictor for the prognosis of ccRCC patients. Correlation analysis between risk score and targets of precise treatments showed that our risk signature could predict the effects of precise treatment powerfully. Conclusion: Our study provided a brand new autophagy-related seven-gene prognostic risk signature, which could perform as a prognostic indicator for ccRCC. Meanwhile, our study provides a novel sight to understand the role of autophagy and suggest therapeutic strategies in the category of precise treatment in ccRCC.",2020,
Machine Learning Methods for Identifying Critical Data Elements in Nursing Documentation,"Background Public health nurses (PHNs) engage in home visiting services and documentation of care services for at-risk clients. To increase efficiency and decrease documentation burden, it would be useful for PHNs to identify critical data elements most associated with patient care priorities and outcomes. Machine learning techniques can aid in retrospective identification of critical data elements. Objective We used two different machine learning feature selection techniques of minimum redundancyâ€“maximum relevance (mRMR) and LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) and elastic net regularized generalized linear model (glmnet in R). Methods We demonstrated application of these techniques on the Omaha System database of 205 data elements (features) with a cohort of 756 family home visiting clients who received at least one visit from PHNs in a local Midwest public health agency. A dichotomous maternal risk index served as the outcome for feature selection. Application Using mRMR as a feature selection technique, out of 206 features, 50 features were selected with scores greater than zero, and generalized linear model applied on the 50 features achieved highest accuracy of 86.2% on a held-out test set. Using glmnet as a feature selection technique and obtaining feature importance, 63 features had importance scores greater than zero, and generalized linear model applied on them achieved the highest accuracy of 95.5% on a held-out test set. Discussion Feature selection techniques show promise toward reducing public health nursing documentation burden by identifying the most critical data elements needed to predict risk status. Further studies to refine the process of feature selection can aid in informing PHNsâ€™ focus on client-specific and targeted interventions in the delivery of care.",2019,Nursing Research
Identification of an Immune-Related Nine-lncRNA Signature Predictive of Overall Survival in Colon Cancer,"Growing evidence suggests that immune-related genes (IRGs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) can serve as prognostic markers of overall survival (OS) in patients with colon cancer. This study aimed to identify an immune-related lncRNA signature for the prospective assessment of prognosis in these patients. Gene expression and clinical data of colon cancer patients were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Immune-related lncRNAs were identified by a correlation analysis between IRGs and lncRNAs. In total, 447 samples were divided into a training cohort (224 samples) and a testing cohort (223 samples). Univariate, lasso and multivariate Cox regression analyses identified an immune-related nine-lncRNA signature closely related to OS in colon cancer patients in the training dataset. A risk score formula involving nine immune-related lncRNAs was developed to evaluate the prognostic value of the lncRNA signature in the training dataset. Colon cancer patients with a high risk score had poorer OS than those with a low risk score. A multivariate Cox regression analysis confirmed that the immune-related nine-lncRNA signature could be an independent prognostic factor in colon cancer patients. The results were further confirmed in the testing cohort and the entire TCGA cohort. Furthermore, a gene set enrichment analysis revealed several pathways with significant enrichment in the high- and low-risk groups that may be helpful in formulating clinical strategies and understanding the underlying mechanisms. Finally, a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assay found that the nine lncRNAs were significantly differentially expressed in colon cancer cell lines. The results of this study indicate that this signature has important clinical implications for improving predictive outcomes and guiding individualized treatment in colon cancer patients. These lncRNAs could be potential biomarkers affecting the prognosis of colon cancer.",2020,
Identifying subtype-specific associations between gene expression and DNA methylation profiles in breast cancer,"BackgroundBreast cancer is a complex disease in which different genomic patterns exists depending on different subtypes. Recent researches present that multiple subtypes of breast cancer occur at different rates, and play a crucial role in planning treatment. To better understand underlying biological mechanisms on breast cancer subtypes, investigating the specific gene regulatory system via different subtypes is desirable.MethodsGene expression, as an intermediate phenotype, is estimated based on methylation profiles to identify the impact of epigenomic features on transcriptomic changes in breast cancer. We propose a kernel weighted l1-regularized regression model to incorporate tumor subtype information and further reveal gene regulations affected by different breast cancer subtypes. For the proper control of subtype-specific estimation, samples from different breast cancer subtype are learned at different rate based on target estimates. Kolmogorov Smirnov test is conducted to determine learning rate of each sample from different subtype.ResultsIt is observed that genes that might be sensitive to breast cancer subtype show prediction improvement when estimated using our proposed method. Comparing to a standard method, overall performance is also enhanced by incorporating tumor subtypes. In addition, we identified subtype-specific network structures based on the associations between gene expression and DNA methylation.ConclusionsIn this study, kernel weighted lasso model is proposed for identifying subtype-specific associations between gene expressions and DNA methylation profiles. Identification of subtype-specific gene expression associated with epigenomic changes might be helpful for better planning treatment and developing new therapies.",2017,BMC Medical Genomics
Extension de la r\'egression lin\'eaire g\'en\'eralis\'ee sur composantes supervis\'ees (SCGLR) aux donn\'ees group\'ees,"We address component-based regularisation of a multivariate Generalized Linear Mixed Model. A set of random responses Y is modelled by a GLMM, using a set X of explanatory variables and a set T of additional covariates. Variables in X are assumed many and redundant: generalized linear mixed regression demands regularisation with respect to X. By contrast, variables in T are assumed few and selected so as to demand no regularisation. Regularisation is performed building an appropriate number of orthogonal components that both contribute to model Y and capture relevant structural information in X. We propose to optimize a SCGLR-specific criterion within a Schall's algorithm in order to estimate the model. This extension of SCGLR is tested on simulated and real data, and compared to Ridge-and Lasso-based regularisations.",2018,arXiv: Methodology
Underdetermined Wideband DOA Estimation for Off-Grid Sources with Coprime Array Using Sparse Bayesian Learning,"Sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) is applied to the coprime array for underdetermined wideband direction of arrival (DOA) estimation. Using the augmented covariance matrix, the coprime array can achieve a higher number of degrees of freedom (DOFs) to resolve more sources than the number of physical sensors. The sparse-based DOA estimation can deteriorate the detection and estimation performance because the sources may be off the search grid no matter how fine the grid is. This dictionary mismatch problem can be well resolved by the SBL using fixed point updates. The SBL can automatically choose sparsity and approximately resolve the non-convex optimizaton problem. Numerical simulations are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the underdetermined wideband DOA estimation via SBL based on coprime array. It is clear that SBL can obtain good performance in detection and estimation compared to least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit least squares (SOMP-LS) , simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit total least squares (SOMP-TLS) and off-grid sparse Bayesian inference (OGSBI).",2018,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)"
Effect of different hand-milking techniques on milk production and teat treatment in Zebu dairy cattle,"The aim of the study was to test three different hand-milking techniques (â€œpull downâ€, â€œthumb inâ€, and â€œfull hand gripâ€) and their effects on milk production and teat treatment. This is important since milk production in many tropical areas still rely on hand-milking. The study was carried out at a peri-urban farm in the Bobo-Dioulasso area in Burkina Faso. Twelve indigenous Zebu cows in early lactation were used in the study. The sequences of the treatments (hand-milking techniques) and the milkers were balanced for carry-over effects between successive periods and days, respectively. The sequences were constructed by using special Latin squares. Yield and composition of saleable milk was not affected by milking technique but there were differences between the milkers in milk yield. There was also a significant interaction for saleable milk yield between milker and milking technique. Hemoglobin in milk was measured as an indicator of teat damage. The hemoglobin content was numerically higher in post-milking strip milk samples than in saleable milk. It was concluded that the amount of milk removed depends mainly on the milker and how well the milking technique works for the individual milker. No effect of milking technique was observed on teat treatment.",2011,Tropical Animal Health and Production

Clinical Psychology Review 74 (2019) 101784 Available online 13 November 2019 0272-7358/ Â© 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/BY-NC-ND/4.0/). T (Neal, Delfabbro, & O'Neil, 2005). The average standardised past-year prevalence rate in adults approximates 2.3% across countries (Williams, Volberg, & Stevens, 2012). Despite ostensibly being an activity that is legally restricted to adults (typically aged 18 years or older) in many jurisdictions, gambling is also a relatively popular activity among adolescents. Although multiple situational and measurement issues may have inflated rates of problem gambling in young people (see Derevensky, Gupta, & Winters, 2003; Shaffer & Korn, 2002), estimates of past year gambling problems in young people internationally range from 0.2% to 12.3% (Calado, Alexandre, & Griffiths, 2017). Despite problem gambling being a relatively low base-rate phenomenon, the burden of harm resulting from gambling-related problems is of a level approximately two-thirds that of alcohol abuse/dependence and major depressive disorder (Browne, Greer, Rawat, & Rockloff, 2017). The negative sequelae of gambling problems can include financial harm, relationship dysfunction and conflict, emotional distress, health decrements, cultural harm, reduced work or study performance, and criminal activity (Langham et al., 2016). 1.1. Screening for problem gambling in clinical settings Despite the considerable harms that can result from gambling problems, relatively few people with gambling problems seek professional help from specialist gambling services (SÃ©guin et al., 2013; Suurvali, Hodgins, Toneatto, & Cunningham, 2008). There is, however, growing evidence to suggest that people with gambling problems are over-represented in primary care (Goodyear-Smith et al., 2006; Levens, Dyer, Zubritsky, Knott, & Oslin, 2005; Morasco, Vom Eigen, & Petry, 2006; Pasternak & Fleming, 1999) alcohol and other drug use (AOD) services (Cowlishaw, Merkouris, Chapman, & Radermacher, 2014), psychiatric inpatient services (Aragay et al., 2012), psychiatric outpatient services (Dowling et al., 2014; Henderson, 2004; Manning et al., 2017; Nehlin, Gronbladh, Fredriksson, & Jansson, 2013), and specific mental health populations, such as those with mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and psychotic disorders (Aragay et al., 2012; Cowlishaw, Hakes, & Dowling, 2016; Dowling et al., 2014; Haydock, Cowlishaw, Harvey, & Castle, 2015; Henderson, 2004; Jones et al., 2015; Kennedy et al., 2010; Manning et al., 2017; McIntyre et al., 2007; Nehlin et al., 2013; Quilty, Watson, Robinson, Toneatto, & Bagby, 2011). Individuals with problem gambling also present to other services, such as family violence (2.2%) and financial counselling services (10.6%; Dowling et al., 2014). The presence of problem gambling complicates the clinical profile of patients with mental health disorders as it is associated with more severe psychiatric symptoms, alcohol and drug use problems, interpersonal and financial problems, poorer physical health and social functioning, cognitive impairment, impulsivity, suicidality, and personality disorder pathology (Biddle, Hawthorne, Forbes, & Coman, 2005; Cowlishaw et al., 2016; Di Nicola et al., 2010; Haydock et al., 2015; Henderson, 2004; Jones et al., 2015; Kennedy et al., 2010; Manning et al., 2017; McIntyre et al., 2007; Zimmerman, Chelminski, & Young, 2006). Moreover, the findings of age of onset studies using retrospective methodologies suggest that at least one other psychiatric disorder typically occurs after the development of problem gambling in approximately one-quarter of cases (Hodgins, Peden, & Cassidy, 2005; Kessler et al., 2008). There is also evidence from longitudinal studies that problem gambling predicts the subsequent development of a range of disorders, including AOD, mood, and anxiety disorders (Chou & Afifi, 2011; Dussault, Brendgen, Vitaro, Wanner, & Tremblay, 2011; Parhami, Mojtabai, Rosenthal, Afifi, & Fong, 2014; Pilver, Libby, Hoff, & Potenza, 2013). Taken together, these findings suggest that problem gambling has the potential to compromise engagement, management plans and mental health outcomes, particularly if it goes undetected and untreated (Brett et al., 2014; Chou & Afifi, 2011; Himelhoch et al., 2015). These findings highlight the importance for services located in local communities, such as primary care, AOD, and mental health services, to accurately screen for problem gambling. These highly accessible services are logistically well placed to enhance the identification of people with gambling problems and offer appropriate generalist first level interventions or referral (Brett et al., 2014; Dowling et al., 2018; Goodyear-Smith, Arroll, & Coupe, 2009; Manning et al., 2017; Rockloff, Ehrich, Themessl-Huber, & Evans, 2011; Rodda, Manning, Dowling, Lee, & Lubman, 2018; Sullivan, McCormick, Lamont, & Penfold, 2007). Although health providers in these services acknowledge that they have a role in helping clients with gambling problems (Corney, 2011; Rodda et al., 2018; Sanju & Gerada, 2011; Sullivan et al., 2007; Sullivan, Arroll, Coster, Abbott, & Adams, 2000; Temcheff, Derevensky, StPierre, Gupta, & Martin, 2014), they hold generally negative attitudes towards screening (Sullivan et al., 2000) and report low rates of screening behaviour (Achab et al., 2014; Manning et al., 2017). Perceived barriers to such screening include lack of time, an absence of information about the effectiveness of screening, a lack of knowledge and skills, the presence of gambling-related stigma, a perception that problem gambling has a low burden of disease, an absence of effective interventions, and limited access to specialist referral services (McCambridge & Cunningham, 2007; Rodda et al., 2018; Rowan & Galasso, 2000; Sullivan, 2011; Sullivan et al., 2000; Sullivan et al., 2007). The low rate of screening may also be, in part, due to the relatively slow development of brief screening instruments and a lack of easily accessible information on their diagnostic accuracy. In the previous decade, however, there has been a rapid growth in the development of brief screening instruments to detect gambling problems. 1.2. Screening for problem gambling in research In addition to screening for problem gambling in clinical settings, brief screening instruments are increasingly employed in problem gambling research, including population-level epidemiological studies (e.g., Gebauer, LaBrie, & Shaffer, 2010; Scholes-Balog, Hemphill, Dowling, & Toumbourou, 2014; Scholes-Balog, Hemphill, Toumbourou, & Dowling, 2015, 2016; Toce-Gerstein, Gerstein, & Volberg, 2009) or school-based research (Lepper & Haden, 2013; Rossow & Molde, 2006). Extended self-report instruments or the inclusion of full diagnostic instruments is often not practical or affordable (Gebauer et al., 2010; Lepper & Haden, 2013; Rossow & Molde, 2006; Toce-Gerstein et al., 2009). In particular, brief instruments can be incorporated into population surveys to provide more cost-effective data collection compared to conducting gambling-specific studies (Rossow & Molde, 2006). 1.3. Brief screening instruments for problem gambling Accurate screening instruments have the potential to improve care and reduce healthcare costs (Tiet, Finney, & Moos, 2008). There is, however, currently limited systematic evidence to guide clinicians and researchers in their selection of a psychometrically sound instrument to screen for problem gambling for their purpose, population, or setting of interest. Although several reviews exploring the psychometric properties of problem gambling assessment instruments are available (Edgren et al., 2016; Stinchfield, 2010, 2014; Stinchfield, Govoni, & Frisch, 2007), these are mostly narrative in nature. To date, only one systematic review is available, which explores the diagnostic accuracy and psychometric properties of instruments measuring at-risk and problem gambling among young individuals (Edgren et al., 2016). The available reviews have generally failed to provide an up-to-date catalogue of brief screening instruments for problem gambling due to their rapid growth in development over recent years. Given time and resource demands, many clinical services or research protocols may only have the capacity to administer very short screening instruments that require little time to administer (Himelhoch et al., 2015). It is therefore essential that screening instruments employed in these clinical settings are brief, easy to use, easily scored, and require minimal training (Brett et al., 2014; Goodyear-Smith et al., 2008; Rockloff et al., 2011; Stinchfield & McCready, 2014; Toce-Gerstein et al., 2009; N.A.

The Relationship Between Cardiac Troponin I and the Severe Degree in Patients With Chronic Heart Failure,"Objective:To investigate the relationship between cardiac troponin I(cTnI)and the classof cardiac function in patients with chronic heart failure(CHF).Methods:428 patients with CHF were selected in this study. All patients were divided into four groups according to NYHA functional class. Blood plasma cTnI were measured by immunofluorescence.Results:The plasma level of cTnI increased with the increasement of the class of NYHA heart function(P 0.01). However, there was no difference between the NYHAâ…  andâ…¡ group.There was significant positive correlation between the plasma level of cTnI and the NYHA functional classes(r= 0.7,P 0.01). Multiple linear regression indentified cTnI having correlation to CHF.Conclusion:The plasma level of cTnI are related with the class of NYHA heart function, regardless of the etiology. Plasma cTnI can be used as the index to evaluate the severity of CHF.",2013,Inner Mongolia Medical Journal
Comprehensive model for the spin evolution of the LAGEOS and LARES satellites,"The two LAGEOS and LARES are laser-ranged satellites tracked with the best accuracy ever achieved. Using their range measurements many geophysical parameters were calculated and some General Relativity effects were directly observed. To obtain precise and refined measurements of the effects due to the predictions of General Relativity on the orbit of these satellites, it is mandatory to model with high precision and accuracy all other forces, reducing the free parameters introduced in the orbit determination. A main category of non-gravitational forces to be considered are those of thermal origin, whose fine modeling strongly depends on the knowledge of the evolution of the spin vector. We present a complete model, named LASSOS, to describe the evolution of the spin of the LAGEOS and LARES satellites. In particular, we solved Euler equations of motion considering not-averaged torques. This is the most general case, and the predictions of the model well fit the available observations of the satellites spin. We also present the predictions of our model in the fast-spin limit, based on the application of averaged equations. The results are in good agreement with those already published, but with our approach we have been able to highlight small errors within these previous works. LASSOS was developed within the LARASE research program. LARASE aims to improve the dynamical model of the two LAGEOS and LARES satellites to provide very precise and accurate measurements of relativistic effects on their orbit, and also to bring benefits to geophysics and space geodesy.",2018,Physical Review D

"[Functional disabilities in elderly people living at home in Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso].","In sub-Saharan Africa, very little research has been conducted on moderate to severe disabilities affecting mobility, communication and mental function in elderly people living at home. The studies that have been conducted have not always described the broader social context, a key factor for understanding and interpreting results. This study was conducted in Burkina Faso and was designed to fill the gaps in our understanding of disability in these areas. A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted in Bobo-Dioulasso among the elderly population (aged 60 and above). Functional status was assessed using the Functional Autonomy Measurement System (SMAF). Data analysis was performed using Stata software. Interviews were conducted with a systematic random sample of 351 elderly adults. Moderate to severe functional disability or the need for supervision or assistance were related to mobility in 10Â % of cases, to mental function in 28Â % of cases and to communication in 37Â % of cases. The need for assistance varied according to the different activities or items in each domain. The rates of disability in this study were higher than those found in previous studies, which have often assessed severe disabilities. All individuals affected by disability stated that they had a stable support network to manage their disability. Families were found to be the primary source of support. The results can be explained by the social context. A good visibility of moderate to severe disabilities should contribute to the development of effective policies to provide care and support to the elderly.",2012,Sante publique
Channel selection for simultaneous and proportional myoelectric prosthesis control of multiple degrees-of-freedom.,"OBJECTIVE
Recent studies have shown the possibility of simultaneous and proportional control of electrically powered upper-limb prostheses, but there has been little investigation on optimal channel selection. The objective of this study is to find a robust channel selection method and the channel subsets most suitable for simultaneous and proportional myoelectric prosthesis control of multiple degrees-of-freedom (DoFs).


APPROACH
Ten able-bodied subjects and one person with congenital upper-limb deficiency took part in this study, and performed wrist movements with various combinations of two DoFs (flexion/extension and radial/ulnar deviation). During the experiment, high density electromyographic (EMG) signals and the actual wrist angles were recorded with an 8 Ã— 24 electrode array and a motion tracking system, respectively. The wrist angles were estimated from EMG features with ridge regression using the subsets of channels chosen by three different channel selection methods: (1) least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), (2) sequential feature selection (SFS), and (3) uniform selection (UNI).


MAIN RESULTS
SFS generally showed higher estimation accuracy than LASSO and UNI, but LASSO always outperformed SFS in terms of robustness, such as noise addition, channel shift and training data reduction. It was also confirmed that about 95% of the original performance obtained using all channels can be retained with only 12 bipolar channels individually selected by LASSO and SFS.


SIGNIFICANCE
From the analysis results, it can be concluded that LASSO is a promising channel selection method for accurate simultaneous and proportional prosthesis control. We expect that our results will provide a useful guideline to select optimal channel subsets when developing clinical myoelectric prosthesis control systems based on continuous movements with multiple DoFs.",2014,Journal of neural engineering
Sentiment spillover effects for US and European companies,"The fast-growing literature on news analytics provides evidence that financial markets are partially driven by sentiments. In contrast with previous studies that have almost exclusively focused on the direct effects of the news related to single companies or sectors, we investigate the time-varying dynamics of newsâ€™ cross-industry influences for a set of US and European stocks over a period of 10 years. The graphical Granger causality of the news sentiments-excess return networks is estimated by applying the adaptive lasso. We find significant spillover effects and show the importance of sentiments related to certain sectors for the whole cross-section of stocks.",2019,Journal of Banking and Finance
Adaptive Scan Gibbs Sampler for Large Scale Inference Problems,"For large scale on-line inference problems the update strategy is critical for performance. We derive an adaptive scan Gibbs sampler that optimizes the update frequency by selecting an optimum mini-batch size. We demonstrate performance of our adaptive batch-size Gibbs sampler by comparing it against the collapsed Gibbs sampler for Bayesian Lasso, Dirichlet Process Mixture Models (DPMM) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) graphical models.",2018,arXiv: Machine Learning
Monoaminergic changes associated with socially induced sex reversal in the saddleback wrasse,"The process of sex reversal in fishes is socially mediated and requires a total reorganization of the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis. When the ratio of males to females in a population of saddleback wrasse (Thalassoma dupperrey) is too low, the largest female becomes male over the course of 6 to 8 weeks. This event requires the conversion of external social cues into internal chemical cues. In an attempt to investigate the role monoamines might play in this process, two females were housed together in floating enclosures in order to induce sex reversal in the larger. Brains were sampled at various time points throughout the process of sex reversal. Monoamines were measured in the amygdala, preoptic area, ventral hypothalamus, locus coeruleus and raphe nucleus. Changes were demonstrated in monoamine metabolism for all brain regions examined. The most important changes in monoamine-system activation were seen during the first week of sex reversal. It is during this time that transitional animals undergo behavioral sex reversal. There is an increase in serotonergic activity in the amygdala which is likely related to territorial acquisition. The absence of male aggression results in a less stressful environment for the female and a reduction in serotonergic activity in the preoptic area allowing for an increase in noradrenergic activity potentially triggering the reorganization of the reproductive axis. In the ventral hypothalamus, there is a decrease in noradrenergic and increase in dopaminergic activity associated with this change from female to male. The locus coeruleus shows an increase in noradrenergic activity later in the process of sex reversal which is probably a response to more circulating androgens. In the raphe nucleus, there is a decrease in serotonergic activity at the time of behavioral sex reversal. This decrease in serotonergic activity is linked to the behavioral component of sex reversal. This study suggests that monoamines play a very important role in both behavioral and gonadal sex reversal in the saddleback wrasse, the former under the control of serotonin in the raphe and the latter mediated via serotonergic effects on norepinephrine in the preoptic area.",2003,Neuroscience
ATCI vs. BRICS: consecuencias sobre la geopolÃ­tica y las relaciones internacionales del siglo XXI,"The TTIP is a proposal on negotiations between the EU and the USA in order to create the largest free international trade area by extension, population and volume of trade of all existing ones. In our view, TTIP would be the geoeconomic answer to BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa), as a comercial, geopolitical and cooperation space in other areas such as the military, in both that TTIP reproduce on a commercial scale the political and military alliance already existing between good part of the EU and USA by the NATO. In this paper we will try to explain why the possible rivalry between TTIP and BRICS would reproduce in the XXIst. Century the schemes of â€œCold Warâ€ inherited from XXth. Century, that in turn reproduced the geopolitical confrontations arising from the theory of Haltford McKinder pivot area and the traditional opposition between thalassocratic imperialisms (government on the seas and oceans) and tellurocratic imperialisms (government on an enormous portion of emerged land). Likewise, we will try to show why, at a dialectic of States level, the most populated, territorially extensive and with greater amount of resources political societies will be those that have the greatest ability to impose a particular model of international relations and its geopolitical hegemony on a universal scale in response to this viable confrontation between TTIP, plus TTP, vs. BRICS.",2016,
Radiomic features based on MRI for prediction of lymphovascular invasion in rectal cancer,"To investigate the value of radiomics in predicting lymphovascular invasion (LVI) status of rectal cancer based on MRI. The retrospective study included 188 patients based on MRI with histologically confirmed rectal cancer and evaluated LVI status. Clinical factors and image data were collected, and radiomics features were extracted from multi-region (tumor and mesorectum) and single region (tumor), respectively, on T2WI and DWI. Spearman correlation analysis and the LASSO algorithm were used for radiomic feature extraction and selection; preliminarily selection of an optimal classifier by the results of the fivefold cross-validation performance in the six preselected specific machine learning classifier. Multi-regional and single-regional predictive models were both built and evaluated by calculating the area under the ROC curve (AUC) and corresponding accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, etc. A Ridge Classification model was constructed with 21 features (2 clinical features, 10 radiomics features from mesorectum region, and 9 radiomics features from tumor region) selected by Spearman correlation and LASSO analysis. The multi-regional model shows a good performance in the differentiation of the status of LVI in training data sets (AUCâ€‰=â€‰0.87, accuracyâ€‰=â€‰0.79). The model was further validated in the testing data sets, giving an AUC and an accuracy of 0.74 and 0.68, respectively. Furthermore, the performance of single-regional model (AUCâ€‰=â€‰0.72, accuracyâ€‰=â€‰0.67) is lower compared to the values given by the multi-regional model. The radiomics model which we developed demonstrates that multi-regional radiomics features based on multiparametric MRI are useful for preoperatively predicting lymphovascular invasion in patients with rectal cancer.",2019,Chinese Journal of Academic Radiology
African traditional medicine struggles to find its place within health care.,"It was to have been the â€œDecade of African Traditional Medicine,â€ a curious, hybrid mix of herbalism and spirituality, in which disease is perceived to be a function of imbalance between a person and his social environment or spiritual state, i.e., a personâ€™s guilt or sin, or even the direct retribution of a god. Treatment, in turn, ranges from incantations to fasting and bleedings but is most often an herbal concoction imbued with metaphysical significance. 
 
The African Union Summit of Heads of State and Government vowed in 2001 that the forthcoming decade would incorporate the practice of African traditional medicine into their health care systems by increasing institutional capacity and developing national regulatory frameworks. 
 
The progress to date? 
 
Checkerboard, at best, according to a World Health Organization progress report on the commitment (www.afro.who.int/en/downloads/doc_download/6665-afrrc61pr2-progress-report-on-decade-of-traditional-medicine-in-the-african-region.html). â€œThe number of countries with national traditional medicine policies increased from eight in 1999/2000 to 39 in 2010 and those with national traditional medicine strategic plans rose from zero to 18. Country regulatory frameworks increased in number from 1 in 1999/2000 to 28 in 2010. Within these frameworks various instruments such as the code of ethics and the legal framework for traditional medicine practitioners were established.â€ 
 
But major impediments remain, the progress report added, including â€œ(i) limited financial and human resources; (ii) weak regulatory capacity which has led to malpractices in traditional medicine in some countries; (iii) insufficient scientific data on the safety, efficacy and quality of traditional medicines; and (iv) unfavorable policy, economic and regulatory environments for local production of traditional medicines.â€

The lack of scientific validity has definitely been an impediment, says Dr. Kofi Annan, head of the Department of Herbal Medicine at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology in Kumasi, Ghana. 
 
As a consequence, in Ghana, efforts at integration have been confined primarily to some of the herbal aspects of African traditional medicine, he says. â€œFrom [a] scientific point of view, aspects of African traditional medicine that cannot be proven by science â€” such as spiritism, psychic healing, soothsaying, and fortune telling â€” are not part of the training of the medical herbalists, and thus are not part of the integration.â€ 
 
Annanâ€™s department has trained 112 medical herbalists since 2001, some 30 of whom are working in public hospitals. Some of those have been and will be involved in a pilot project established in 2010 by the nationâ€™s Ministry of Health that designated 18 public hospitals for integration of some of the herbal components of African traditional medicine into their daily practice. 
 
Despite some initial skepticism about the role of herbalists, there has been some progress, says Ama Kyeraa Amoh-Barimah, head of the herbal medicine unit at the Cape Coast Metropolitan Hospital. â€œWe even have internal referral systems so that when physicians identify patients who need alternative forms of treatment for diseases such as hypertension and diabetes, they refer them to us and we also refer cases that need orthodox treatments to physicians.â€ 
 
Amoh-Barimah says that among the herbal remedies that have most readily been incorporated into the hospitalâ€™s offered treatments is a mixture of herbs that has Cryptolepis sanguinolenta (a root traditionally used as an antimalarial) as an active ingredient and is used to treat hypertension. Others include â€œasena decoction,â€ which is derived in part from Kigelia africana and used to treat arthritis; a powdered extract of the plant Bridelia ferruginea that is used to treat diabetes; a mixture called â€œulcerplex oralâ€ that is derived from Tetrapleura tetraptera and used to manage peptic ulcer; a â€œdiagellates elixirâ€ made from the plant Psidium guajava that is used to manage intestinal worms, peptic ulcer, and dyspepsia; as well as a mixture called â€œcampa Tâ€ that is derived from Thonningia sanguinea and used to manage asthma and waist pain. 
 
The government of Ghana has approved a list of 86 herbal remedies for use in hospitals (www.tm-moh.gov.gh/v2/images/stories/RECOMMENDED_HERBAL_DRUG_LIST.pdf), says Peter Arhin, director of the Traditional and Alternative Medicine Directorate of the Ministry of Health. 
 
But most are not popular among patients as they are liquid preparations and are often thought to be inconvenient, Arhin says. â€œWe are looking for support to build pharmaceutical infrastructure to enable us [to] prepare herbal medicines in convenient dosage forms like tablets and capsules and to also help us conduct more observational studies on the efficacy and safety of the medicines.â€ 
 
Many people prefer tablets and capsules to liquid herbal medicines, explains Nana Yaa Agyeman, executive director of Sharecare Ghana, a patient advocacy organization. â€œI donâ€™t trust the quality of the water used for preparing liquid herbal medicines but for tablets and capsules, I donâ€™t have such fears.â€ 
 
In the long-term, integration of African traditional medicine with Western medicine will require a more scientific approach and more scientific training of herbalists, says Dr. Kofi Busia, traditional medicine officer at the West African Health Organisation, based in Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso. 
 
To that end, the organization has been funding workshops for training traditional practitioners and has piloted software designed to facilitate access to the services of traditional African medicine practitioners â€œbecause they are integral to primary health care in Africa,â€ Busia says.",2012,CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association journal = journal de l'Association medicale canadienne
Novel model selection criteria on sparse biological networks,"In statistical literature, gene networks are represented by graphical models, known by their sparsity in high dimensions. In this study, we suggest novel model selection criteria, namely, ICOMP, CAIC and CAICF to apply on simulated gene networks when selecting an optimal model among alternative estimated networksâ€™ constructions. In this description, we build models with the Gaussian graphical model (GGM) and the inference of GGM is achieved via the graphical lasso method. In the assessment of our proposed model selection criteria, we compare their accuracies with other well-known criteria in this field under various dimensions and topologies of networks.",2019,International Journal of Environmental Science and Technology
LASSO tuning parameter selection,"The LASSO is a penalized regression method which simultaneously performs shrinkage and variable selection. The output produced by the LASSO consists of a piecewise linear solution path, starting with the null model and ending with the full least squares fit, as the value of a tuning parameter is decreased. The performance of the selected model therefore depends greatly on the choice of this parameter. This paper attempts to provide an overview of methods which are available to select the value of the tuning parameter for either prediction or variable selection purposes. A simulation study provides a comparison of these methods and assesses their performance.",2015,
George Glasson and George Boggâ€™s prospects on the environmental friendly relationship and ecojustice,"This rejoinder to George Glasson and George Boggâ€™s papers provides additional conversation for considering the idea that we try to develop: leaving the classroom to continue teaching. Converting the teachingâ€“learning process into research experiences brings our students not only scientific knowledge, but also an understanding of the research procedures. To be involved in field work, students can connect more personally the local action with global issues. On the ground in which we operate, environmental science, teaching of knowledge is insufficient if not accompanied by ecological experiences where students can see and share the needs of environmental protection and the idea of sustainability. Both response authors tell us about their own experiences in research in this regard. In their essays we can appreciate the desire to investigate human activities on ecosystems. Reading it makes us look with passion and awareness at the different consequences for our ecological environments: if we develop environmentally consequential behavior or harmful lifestyles for the planet. Furthermore, they warn us of the need to follow the development of students learning and reflect on the ways in which it produces time-causal relationship between persons and the environment.",2011,Cultural Studies of Science Education
Radiomic features as a non-invasive biomarker to predict response to immunotherapy in recurrent or metastatic urothelial carcinoma,"Abstract Background Reliable biomarkers to predict response to immunotherapy is crucial for patientsâ€™ counseling and decision making. This study was aimed to identify the role of CT radiomic features in predicting response to immunotherapy in patients with recurrent or metastatic urothelial carcinoma. Methods A total of 62 patients with their 224 lesions who underwent PD-1 and PD-L1 immunotherapy between March 2015 and November 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were temporally divided into training sets (nÂ =Â 41; 155 lesions) and independent test set (nÂ =Â 21; 69 lesions). For radiomics feature extraction, two radiologists independently segmented the region of interest at baseline CT on portal venous phase. A radiomics signature (RAD score) was built by using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method. The diagnostic performance of RAD score for prediction of response to immunotherapy was evaluated by C statistics. Results The overall response rate of immunotherapy was 36.6% in the training set and 28.8% in the test set. RAD score revealed the C statistics of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.68â€“0.93) in the training set and a corresponding C statistics of 0.71 (95% CI, 0.48â€“0.89) in the test set. Conclusions This study suggests that radiomic features extracted from metastatic masses at baseline CT are predictive of response to immunotherapy in patients with recurrent or metastatic urothelial carcinoma.

Improved variable selection with Forward-Lasso adaptive shrinkage,"Recently, considerable interest has focused on variable selection methods in regression situations where the number of predictors, $p$, is large relative to the number of observations, $n$. Two commonly applied variable selection approaches are the Lasso, which computes highly shrunk regression coefficients, and Forward Selection, which uses no shrinkage. We propose a new approach, ""Forward-Lasso Adaptive SHrinkage"" (FLASH), which includes the Lasso and Forward Selection as special cases, and can be used in both the linear regression and the Generalized Linear Model domains. As with the Lasso and Forward Selection, FLASH iteratively adds one variable to the model in a hierarchical fashion but, unlike these methods, at each step adjusts the level of shrinkage so as to optimize the selection of the next variable. We first present FLASH in the linear regression setting and show that it can be fitted using a variant of the computationally efficient LARS algorithm. Then, we extend FLASH to the GLM domain and demonstrate, through numerous simulations and real world data sets, as well as some theoretical analysis, that FLASH generally outperforms many competing approaches.",2011,The Annals of Applied Statistics
BPH: Plasmakinetic enucleation noninferior to open prostatectomy,"Researchers have developed a new prognostic model for overall survival after first-line chemotherapy, which takes into account the advances that have been made in the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) in recent years. Using data from a phase III trial of 1,050 men, the researchers used adaptive lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) to select eight prognostic factors (including disease site, lactate dehydrogenase and opioid analgesic use) that could be used to predict overall survival; they validated the model in an external set.",2014,Nature Reviews Urology
"A multidimensional nomogram combining overall stage, dose volume histogram parameters and radiomics to predict progression-free survival in patients with locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma.","OBJECTIVES
To develop a multidimensional nomogram for predicting the progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) (stage III-IVa).


MATERIALS AND METHODS
A total of 224 patients with locoregionally advanced NPC (training cohort, nâ€¯=â€¯149; validation cohort, nâ€¯=â€¯75) were retrospectively included. We extracted 260 radiomic features from the primary tumor and lymph nodes on the axial contrast-enhanced T1 weighted and T2 weighted MRI. Radiomic signatures of the gross tumor volume (RSnx) and lymph node (RSnd), Dose Volume Histogram (DVH) signature reflecting planning score (PS), and clinical characteristics were included as potential predictors of PFS. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression were applied for feature selection and data dimension reduction. A nomogram was developed by incorporating the selected predictors. The C-index and calibration curve were used to assess discrimination and calibration power of the nomogram, respectively.


RESULTS
RSnd, PS, and tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage were the independent predictors for PFS (all pâ€¯<â€¯0.05). The nomogram integrating the three factors achieved a C-index of 0.811 (95% CI: 0.74-0.882) in the validation cohort for predicting PFS, which outperformed than that of the TNM stage alone (C-index, 0.613, 95% CI: 0.532-0.694). Subgroup analysis showed Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA status improved the predictive accuracy of the nomogram (C-index, 0.86, 95% CI: 0.787-0.933).


CONCLUSIONS
The multidimensional nomogram incorporating RSnd, PS, and TNM stage showed high performance for predicting PFS in patients with locoregionally advanced NPC.",2019,Oral oncology
PReMS: Parallel Regularised Regression Model Search for sparse bio-signature discovery,"There is increasing interest in developing point of care tests to diagnose disease and predict prognosis based upon biomarker signatures of RNA or protein expression levels. Technology to measure the required biomarkers accurately and in a time-frame useful to health care professionals will be easier to develop by minimising the number of biomarkers measured. In this paper we describe the Parallel Regularised Regression Model Search (PReMS) method which is designed to estimate parsimonious prediction models. Given a set of potential biomarkers PReMS searches over many logistic regression models constructed from optimal subsets of the biomarkers, iteratively increasing the model size. Zero centred Gaussian prior distributions are assigned to all regression coefficients to induce shrinkage. The method estimates the optimal shrinkage parameter, optimal model for each model size and the optimal model size. We apply PReMS to six freely available data sets and compare its performance with the LASSO and SCAD algorithms in terms of the number of covariates in the model, model accuracy, as measured by the area under the receiver operator curve (AUC) and root predicted mean square error, and model calibration. We show that PReMS typically selects models with fewer biomarkers than both the LASSO and SCAD algorithms but has comparable predictive accuracy.

Post-stroke Complications and Mortality in BurkinabÃ¨ Hospitals: Relationships with Deglutition Disorders and Nutritional Status,"Stroke frequently causes deglutition disorders, leading to a decline in nutritional status and complications, and increasing mortality. Sub-Saharan data are scarce. The objectives of this study were to assess complications and mortality among hospitalized patients in Burkina Faso during the first two weeks after stroke, and to investigate associated factors. Patients with stroke were followed prospectively in Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso hospitals. Deglutition disorders and nutritional parameters were assessed at baseline (D0) and on Days 8 (D8) and 14 (D14). Complications and mortality were recorded up to D14. Factors associated with complications and mortality were investigated using multivariate analysis. Of the 222 patients included, 81.5% developed at least one complication, and mortality was 17.1%. At D0, D8, and D14, the rate of deglutition disorders was 37.4%, 28.4%, and 15.8%, respectively, and that of undernourishment 25.2%, 29.4%, and 31.0%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, only the presence of deglutition disorders was a risk factor for developing at least one complication (ORâ€‰=â€‰5.47, 95% CI 1.81â€“16.51). Factors predicting death were the presence of deglutition disorders at D0 (ORâ€‰=â€‰7.19, 95% CI 3.10â€“16.66), and at least one seizure during follow-up (ORâ€‰=â€‰3.69, 95% CI 1.63â€“8.36). After stroke, the rates of complications, death, and undernourishment were high compared to Western countries. Prevention and management of deglutition disorders, and specific follow-up of patients with seizures could reduce post-stroke mortality.",2020,Dysphagia
"seagull: lasso, group lasso and sparse-group lasso regularisation for linear regression models via proximal gradient descent","Statistical analyses of biological problems in life sciences often lead to high-dimensional linear models. To solve the corresponding system of equations, penalisation approaches are often the methods of choice. They are especially useful in case of multicollinearity which appears if the number of explanatory variables exceeds the number of observations or for some biological reason. Then, the model goodness of fit is penalised by some suitable function of interest. Prominent examples are the lasso, group lasso and sparse-group lasso. Here, we offer a fast and numerically cheap implementation of these operators via proximal gradient descent. The grid search for the penalty parameter is realised by warm starts. The step size between consecutive iterations is determined with backtracking line search. Finally, the package produces complete regularisation paths.

Detection of gene-gene interactions using multistage sparse and low-rank regression.,"Finding an efficient and computationally feasible approach to deal with the curse of high-dimensionality is a daunting challenge faced by modern biological science. The problem becomes even more severe when the interactions are the research focus. To improve the performance of statistical analyses, we propose a sparse and low-rank (SLR) screening based on the combination of a low-rank interaction model and the Lasso screening. SLR models the interaction effects using a low-rank matrix to achieve parsimonious parametrization. The low-rank model increases the efficiency of statistical inference and, hence, SLR screening is able to more accurately detect gene-gene interactions than conventional methods. Incorporation of SLR screening into the Screen-and-Clean approach (Wasserman and Roeder, 2009; Wu et al., 2010) is also discussed, which suffers less penalty from Boferroni correction, and is able to assign p-values for the identified variables in high-dimensional model. We apply the proposed screening procedure to the Warfarin dosage study and the CoLaus study. The results suggest that the new procedure can identify main and interaction effects that would have been omitted by conventional screening methods.",2016,Biometrics
Fast Overlapping Group Lasso,"The group Lasso is an extension of the Lasso for feature selection on (predefined) non-overlapping groups of features. The non-overlapping group structure limits its applicability in practice. There have been several recent attempts to study a more general formulation, where groups of features are given, potentially with overlaps between the groups. The resulting optimization is, however, much more challenging to solve due to the group overlaps. In this paper, we consider the efficientoptimization of the overlapping group Lasso penalized problem. We reveal several key properties of the proximal operator associated with the overlapping group Lasso, and compute the proximal operator by solving the smooth and convex dual problem, which allows the use of the gradient descent type of algorithms for the optimization. We have performed empirical evaluations using the breast cancer gene expression data set, which consists of 8,141 genes organized into (overlapping) gene sets. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",2010,ArXiv
When Does More Regularization Imply Fewer Degrees of Freedom? Sufficient Conditions and Counter Examples from Lasso and Ridge Regression,"Regularization aims to improve prediction performance of a given statistical modeling approach by moving to a second approach which achieves worse training error but is expected to have fewer degrees of freedom, i.e., better agreement between training and prediction error. We show here, however, that this expected behavior does not hold in general. In fact, counter examples are given that show regularization can increase the degrees of freedom in simple situations, including lasso and ridge regression, which are the most common regularization approaches in use. In such situations, the regularization increases both training error and degrees of freedom, and is thus inherently without merit. On the other hand, two important regularization scenarios are described where the expected reduction in degrees of freedom is indeed guaranteed: (a) all symmetric linear smoothers, and (b) linear regression versus convex constrained linear regression (as in the constrained variant of ridge regression and lasso).",2013,arXiv: Statistics Theory
Anfallsforverring forÃ¥rsaket av antiepileptika,"Resultater og fortolkning. Som en fÃ¸lge av behandlingen kan noen pasienter ikke bare fÃ¥ en Ã¸kt frekvens, styrke og varighet av sine ordinÃ¦re anfall, men ogsÃ¥ nye anfallstyper, og i verste fall status epilepticus. BÃ¥de gamle og nye antiepileptika kan gi anfallsforverring, men best dokumentert er karbamazepininduserte generaliserte anfall, slik som absenser og myoklonier. Patofysiologien ved legemiddelindusert anfallsforverring er ikke fullt ut forstÃ¥tt, men trolig gjÃ¸r flere mekanismer seg gjeldende, sÃ¥ som medikamentintoksikasjon med sederende og prokonvulsive effekter av hÃ¸ye serumkonsentrasjoner, medikamentbetinget encefalopati og en paradoksal farmakodynamisk effekt. I all epilepsibehandling er anfallsog epilepsiklassifikasjon viktig. Av og til blir atypiske absenser forvekslet med komplekse partielle anfall. Pasienter dette gjelder blir gjerne gitt smalspektrede antiepileptika av typen natriumkanalblokkere (for eksempel karbamazepin, fenytoin, okskarbazepin) eller GABAerge stoffer (for eksempel vigabatrin, tiagabin) og risikerer dermed Ã¥ bli verre. HÃ¸yest risiko for legemiddelassosiert anfallsforverring har psykisk utviklingshemmede og barn med alvorlige epileptiske encefalopatier med hÃ¸y anfallsfrekvens, flere anfallstyper, og som fÃ¥r flere medikamenter. Et av medisinens fÃ¸rste bud er aldri Ã¥ skade pasienten, nihil nocere. I behandling av epilepsi opplever vi ikke sjelden overraskelser i form av at medikamenter som er ment Ã¥ skulle gi anfallsbeskyttelse, tvert imot forsterker anfallstendensen. Slike paradoksale effekter av antiepileptika har vÃ¦rt lite pÃ¥aktet i kliniske studier, og etter vÃ¥rt skjÃ¸nn fortjener fenomenet stÃ¸rre oppmerksomhet. Antiepileptika hever vanligvis anfallsterskelen ved Ã¥ redusere den nevronale eksitabilitet pÃ¥ forskjellige mÃ¥ter. De senere Ã¥r har det kommet et Ã¸kende antall rapporter om medikamentutlÃ¸st anfallsforverring (1â€“5). Selv om det er fÃ¥ gode og systematiske studier pÃ¥ dette feltet, og mange av rapportene har en anekdotisk karakter og er vitenskapelig sett lite robuste, tilsier klinisk erfaring med bÃ¥de gamle og nye antiepileptika at paradoksale effekter forekommer. Det er imidlertid vanskelig Ã¥ kvantifisere risikoen for medikamentindusert anfallsforverring fordi tilgjengelige data ikke er populasjonsbasert. I denne artikkelen gir vi en oppsummering av rapportert kunnskap om hvilke anfallstyper og epilepsisyndromer som kan forverres av de ulike antiepileptika.",2008,Tidsskrift for Den Norske Laegeforening

Discovering key regulatory mechanisms from single-factor and multi-factor regulations in glioblastoma utilizing multi-dimensional data.,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant brain cancer in adults. Investigating the regulatory mechanisms underlying GBM is effective for the in-depth study of GBM. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project is producing large-scale data and makes the comprehensive study of the diverse regulatory mechanisms underlying GBM possible. Although there have been research studies on GBM with large-scale data, distinguishing different regulatory mechanisms and identifying the key regulation types remain challenging. In this study, we integrated multi-dimensional data of differentially expressed genes in GBM: copy number variation (CNV), gene expression, miRNA expression and methylation, by performing partial correlation analysis with the Lasso technique. Our results showed that there were single-factor and multi-factor regulatory mechanisms in GBM. In further analysis of the regulation subtypes, we discovered that single-factor and multi-factor regulations are potentially distinct in functionality. Moreover, multi-factor regulations especially the key regulation subtypes may be more relevant to GBM and affect many GBM-related genes such as ERBB2 and MAPK1. This study not only verifies the utility of multi-dimensional data integration into GBM research but also distinguishes the key multi-factor regulatory subtypes that may drive pathogenesis of GBM from various regulatory mechanisms.",2015,Molecular bioSystems
Survival Prediction In High Dimensional Datasets â€“ Comparative Evaluation Of Lasso Regularization and Random Survival Forests,"Background High-dimensional data obtained using modern molecular technologies (e.g., gene expression, proteomics) and large clinical datasets is increasingly common. Risk stratification based on such high-dimensional data remains challenging. Traditional statistical models have a limited capability of handling large numbers of variables, non-linear effects, correlations and missing data. More importantly, as more variables are analyzed, models tend to over-fit (i.e., the model provides good predictions on the studied data but performs poorly on other data).

Recently two methods have been proposed for handling multivariate analysis of high-dimensional data. The Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) minimizes the number of Cox regression coefficients, favoring models that are parsimonious and less likely to over-fit. LASSO is computationally efficient and capable of handling correlated variables. Random Survival Forests (RSF) combines multiple decision trees built on randomly selected subsets of variables. This enables the evaluation of all variables, even in the presence of significant correlations or missing data, and reduces over-fitting. Few studies have evaluated these models on realistic datasets. This study compared the performance of LASSO and RSF to that of the traditional Cox Proportional Hazard (CoxPH) with respect to their ability to predict survival based on high dimensional reverse phase protein array (RPPA) data from Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) patients.

Methods Our data were derived from previous work to define the role of the pathway activation in AML using a custom made RPPA onto which were printed leukemia enriched cells from 511 newly diagnosed AML patients collected between 1992 and 2007. The RPPA was probed with 231 strictly validated antibodies. Data were normalized and analysis was performed for the 415 subjects that underwent therapy at MD Anderson. The dataset also included 38 clinical variables.

We removed cases with a documented survival of less than 4 weeks and imputed a small number of sporadically missing values by random sampling with replacement. We generated LASSO, RSF, and CoxPH models using R. We built RSF models using 1000 trees and 10 random split points. We then identified key features using the RSF max-subtree and the glmnet cross validation methods. We built an RSF and Cox models to these variables only. Models were trained on a bootstrap sample of the size of the dataset, randomly sampled with replacement, and tested on the un-sampled remaining cases. The process was repeated for 50 iterations and results were averaged. We report Harrellâ€™s concordance index (C-Index) and the Brier score for model performance. Harrellâ€™s C-Index is a pairwise comparison of all observations in the testset. It evaluates the probability of erroneously assigining longer survival time to one case over the other. Brier score calculates the difference between the predicted and observed probabilities. It evaluates how well the model fits the entire dataset.

Results Cox regression with LASSO regularization had the best performance based on both Brier score and C-Index ([Table 1][1] and figure 1). For the complete dataset Cox regression models did not converge even when using forward feature selection. Cox regression following feature selection based on RSF had inferior performance compared to other methods.

Comparison of model performance



Conclusions LASSO and RSF allow for mutlivariate analysis of high-dimensional data that would have not been possible otherwise. LASSO regularization outperforms other methods in terms of accuracy and to select features for traditional Cox models. Using the latter approach has great appeal as traditional Cox models allow easy interpertation of the hazard associated with individual variables. Differences in Brier scores are more pronounced than C-Indexes, possibly indicating a tendency of LASSO regularization to overfit the data compared to RSF.

A New Sparsity-Based Band Selection Method for Target Detection of Hyperspectral Image,"Band selection (BS) plays an important role in the dimensionality reduction of hyperspectral data. However, as to the existing BS methods, few are specially designed for target detection. In this letter, we combine the target detection and BS process together and put forward a new BS method for target detection, named least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)-based BS (LBS). Interestingly, by using a linear regression model with L1 regularization (LASSO model), LBS transforms the discrete BS problem into the continuous optimization problem, which cannot only avoid the complicated subset selection process but also evaluate the importance of all the bands simultaneously. The experiments on real hyperspectral data demonstrate that LBS is a very effective BS method for target detection.",2015,IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters
Establishment of the Prognosis Predicting Signature for Endometrial Cancer Patient,"BACKGROUND Novel biomarkers provide clinicians more critical information on tumor genetic features and patients' prognosis. Here, we aimed to establish prognosis-predicting signatures for endometrial carcinoma (EC) patients based on the miRNA information. MATERIAL AND METHODS The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) website was available for dataset extraction. Prognosis-associated miRNAs were generated by univariate Cox regression test. Online websites were used to predict the targeted genes of these enrolled miRNAs. The miRNA-mRNA network was described by Cytoscape software, while the relevant signaling pathways of these targeted genes were enriched by Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses. RESULTS The miRNA-based overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) predicting signatures were constructed by LASSO Cox regression analyses, respectively, by which, the endometrial carcinoma patients were separated into high- and low-risk groups in both the discovery and validation sets. Univariate Cox regression analyses suggested that these high-risk patients had elevated death and recurrence risk compared to low-risk patients. In addition, multivariate Cox regression analysis confirmed that our signatures were independent prognosticate factors with or without clinicopathological features for endometrial carcinoma patients. Moreover, the miRNA-mRNA network was displayed by Cytoscape software, and the pathway enrichment analyses found that the targeted genes of these enrolled miRNAs were enriched in tumor progression and drug resistance-related pathways. CONCLUSIONS The OS and RFS predicting classifiers serve as independent prognosis-associated determiners for EC patients.",2019,Medical Science Monitor : International Medical Journal of Experimental and Clinical Research

A direct estimation of high dimensional stationary vector autoregressions,"The vector autoregressive (VAR) model is a powerful tool in learning complex time series and has been exploited in many elds. The VAR model poses some unique challenges to researchers: On one hand, the dimensionality, introduced by incorporating multiple numbers of time series and adding the order of the vector autoregression, is usually much higher than the time series length; On the other hand, the temporal dependence structure naturally present in the VAR model gives rise to extra diculties in data analysis. The regular way in cracking the VAR model is via \least squares"" and usually involves adding dierent penalty terms (e.g., ridge or lasso penalty) in handling high dimensionality. In this manuscript, we propose an alternative way in estimating the VAR model. The main idea is, via exploiting the temporal dependence structure, formulating the estimating problem to a linear program. There is instant advantage of the proposed approach over the lassotype estimators: The estimation equation can be decomposed to multiple sub-equations and accordingly can be solved eciently using parallel computing. Besides that, we also bring new theoretical insights into the VAR model analysis. So far the theoretical results developed in high dimensions (e.g., Song and Bickel, 2011 and Kock and Callot, 2015) are based on stringent assumptions that are not transparent. Our results, on the other hand, show that the spectral norms of the transition matrices play an important role in estimation accuracy and build estimation and prediction consistency accordingly. Moreover, we provide some experiments on both synthetic and real-world equity data. We show that there are empirical advantages of our method over the lasso-type estimators in parameter estimation and forecasting.",2015,J. Mach. Learn. Res.
Initial experience in the use of Carto-Merge to guide catherer ablation of paroxysm atrial fibrillation,"Objective:To report the initial experience in the use of integrated multislice helical CT image into three-dimensional electroanatomic mapping(Carto-Merge) guideing catheter ablation of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation(PAf). Method:Twenty patients with drug-refractory PAf were referred for catheter ablation of Af. The 64-slice CT image was performed with 1-3 day prior to the ablation procedures.One transeptal puncture was performed under fluoroscopic guidance and two long vascular sheaths were introduced into the left atrium (LA).Then one lasso catheter and one CARTO irrigated ablation catheter was positioned.After recontstruction of LA and pulmonary vein antrum (PVs) by CARTO, using a novel software package , LA with PVs was segmented and extracted for image registration, with a combination of landmark registration and surface registration. Then,circumferential linear ablation was performed at a distance range from 5mm to 10mm away from the ostium of pulmonary.Result:The mean distance between the electroanatomic geometry of left atrium and the corresponding points of CT imaging was (1.64Â±0.18)mm.Upon completion of the circumferential lesions around the PVs,40 ablation rings were achieves and 40 PV pairs were electrically isolated. The mean procedure time was (170.51Â±38.47) minutes. Eighteen patients were free of Af recurrence and 2 patients had significantly reduced Af episode after 1-7 month followup.No complication were observed aming them.Conclusion:Catherer ablation of atrial fibrillation under the guide of Carto-Merge is safe and effective in Af.",2007,Journal of Clinical Cardiology
CT-based radiomics signature for the stratification of N2 disease risk in clinical stage I lung adenocarcinoma.,"Background
Risk stratification of N2 disease is vital for selecting candidates to receive invasive mediastinal staging modalities. In this study, we aimed to stratify the risk of N2 metastasis in clinical stage I lung adenocarcinoma using radiomics analysis.


Methods
Two datasets of patients with clinical stage I lung adenocarcinoma who underwent lung resection were included (training dataset, 880; validation dataset, 322). Using PyRadiomics, 1,078 computed tomography (CT)-based radiomics features were extracted after semi-automated lung nodule segmentation. In order to predict N2 status, a radiomics signature was constructed after selecting the optimal radiomics feature subset by sequentially applying minimum-redundancy-maximum-relevance and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) techniques. Its performance was validated in the validation dataset.


Results
The incidences of N2 metastasis were 8.4% and 7.1% in the training and validation datasets, respectively. Unsupervised cluster analysis revealed that radiomics features significantly correlated with lymph node status and pathological subtypes. For N2 disease prediction, five radiomics features were selected to establish the radiomics signature, which showed a significantly better predictive performance than clinical factors (P<0.001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.81 (0.77-0.86) and 0.69 (0.63-0.75) for radiomics signature and clinical factors, respectively, in the training dataset, and 0.82 (0.71-0.92) and 0.64 (0.52-0.75), respectively, in the validation dataset.


Conclusions
The established CT-based radiomics signature could stratify the risk of N2 metastasis in clinical stage I lung adenocarcinoma, thus assisting clinicians in making patient-specific mediastinal staging strategy.",2019,Translational lung cancer research

Regularized estimation for the least absolute relative error models with a diverging number of covariates,"This paper considers the variable selection for the least absolute relative error (LARE) model, where the dimension of model, p n , is allowed to increase with the sample size n . Under some mild regular conditions, we establish the oracle properties, including the consistency of model selection and the asymptotic normality for the estimator of non-zero parameter. An adaptive weighting scheme is considered in the regularization, which admits the adaptive Lasso, SCAD and MCP penalties by linear approximation. The theoretical results allow the dimension diverging at the rate p n = o ( n 1 / 2 ) for the consistency and p n = o ( n 1 / 3 ) for the asymptotic normality. Furthermore, a practical variable selection procedure based on least squares approximation (LSA) is studied and its oracle property is also provided. Numerical studies are carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed approaches.",2016,Comput. Stat. Data Anal.
l1-l2 regularization of split feasibility problems,"Numerous problems in signal processing and imaging, statistical learning and data mining, or computer vision can be formulated as optimization problems which consist in minimizing a sum of convex functions, not necessarily differentiable, possibly composed with linear operators and that in turn can be transformed to split feasibility problems (SFP); see for example Censor and Elfving (Numer. Algorithms 8, 221â€“239 1994). Each function is typically either a data fidelity term or a regularization term enforcing some properties on the solution; see for example Chaux et al. (SIAM J. Imag. Sci. 2, 730â€“762 2009) and references therein. In this paper, we are interested in split feasibility problems which can be seen as a general form of Q-Lasso introduced in Alghamdi et al. (2013) that extended the well-known Lasso of Tibshirani (J. R. Stat. Soc. Ser. B 58, 267â€“288 1996). Q is a closed convex subset of a Euclidean m-space, for some integer m â‰¥ 1, that can be interpreted as the set of errors within given tolerance level when linear measurements are taken to recover a signal/image via the Lasso. Inspired by recent works by Lou and Yan (2016), Xu (IEEE Trans. Neural Netw. Learn. Syst. 23, 1013â€“1027 2012), we are interested in a nonconvex regularization of SFP and propose three split algorithms for solving this general case. The first one is based on the DC (difference of convex) algorithm (DCA) introduced by Pham Dinh Tao, the second one is nothing else than the celebrate forward-backward algorithm, and the third one uses a method introduced by Mine and Fukushima. It is worth mentioning that the SFP model a number of applied problems arising from signal/image processing and specially optimization problems for intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) treatment planning; see for example Censor et al. (Phys. Med. Biol. 51, 2353â€“2365, 2006).",2017,Numerical Algorithms
Phylogeny of central CO2/pH chemoreception in vertebrates,"The traditional view has been that respiratory chemoreceptors responsive to changes in PCO2/pH first evolved in air-breathing vertebrates at both peripheral and central sites. Levels of arterial PCO2 in water breathing fish are typically less than 2â€“3 torr and it has been assumed that the ventilatory responses of fish to changes in aquatic PCO2/pH were due to the effects of acidosis on haemoglobin oxygen transport. There is growing evidence, however, to suggest that fish also possess peripheral chemoreceptors responsive to changes in PCO2/pH per se that reside primarily in the gills, are innervated by the glassopharyngeal and vagus nerves, and respond primarily to changes in aquatic rather than arterial PCO2. Their distribution overlaps extensively with that of the gill O2 chemoreceptors in fish and it is not yet clear whether both responses arise from the same sensory cells. To date, there is no convincing evidence that strictly water breathing fish possess central chemoreceptors. 
 
There is, however, growing evidence to suggest that some species of air-breathing fish possess central CO2 chemoreceptors. Central chemosensitivity has been reported in in vitro brainstem-spinal cord preparations from both a primitive (holostean) and a modern (teleost) actinopterygian (ray finned) fish. Stimulation of these putative receptors had no effect on fictive gill ventilation but stimulated fictive air breathing. Unfortunately, the fictive breathing rates of these preparations were more than 25 times the resting rates reported for intact animals raising questions about the physiological significance of changes in the fictive motor output identified as air breathing under these conditions. In the South American lung-fish (a sarcopterygian fish belonging to the lineage giving rise to higher vertebrates), on the other hand, central perfusion with mock csf of differing pH stimulated air breathing at rates similar to those seen in control animals. While these data suggest that central chemoreceptors have arisen several times in evolutionary history, hand in hand with the evolution of air breathing, this issue is not yet totally resolved. 
 
An intriguing and related finding is that central CO2 chemosensitivity appears to develop slowly in amphibian tadpoles. It is not present in young tadpoles but develops over time. The receptors initially stimulate gill ventilation but transfer their influence to lung ventilation just prior to metamorphosis from the aquatic larval stage into the air breathing adult form. In association with this the primary location of the receptors in the brainstem shifts from a diffuse distribution to a rostral concentration. While central chemoreceptors have been demonstrated in reptiles and birds, not much is known of their properties or distribution. They have been well studied in mammals where there is growing evidence for multiple sites of central CO2/pH chemoreception and evidence to suggest that the mechanism of sensory transduction may vary both within and between receptor populations. While there has been much recent interest in the membrane channels, receptors and electrical coupling of several chemosensitive sites, this work has largely been on cells with downstream respiratory rhythmicity in preparations whose responses are very different (in terms of changes in frequency and amplitude of phrenic output) from that which is seen in intact animals. 
 
The phylogenetic trends that are emerging indicate that the use of CO2 chemoreception for cardio-respiratory processes may have arisen much earlier than previously believed, that CO2/pH chemoreception arose in the periphery before the evolution of central CO2/pH chemoreceptors, that the sites of CO2/pH chemoreception (both peripheral and central) have increased throughout the course of vertebrate evolution and that the mechanism of CO2/pH chemotransduction may vary. The sum of the data suggests that CO2/pH chemoreceptors have arisen multiple times, at multiple sites during vertebrate evolution.",2001,Respiratory Research
Best Model for Swiss Banknote Data,"When we discriminate Swiss banknote data by IP-OLDF, we find that these data are linearly separable data (LSD). Because we examine all possible combination models, we can find that a two-variable model, such as (X4, X6), is the minimum linearly separable model. A total of 16 models, including these two variables, are linearly separable by the monotonic decrease of MNM (MNM p â‰¥ MNM(p+1)), and other 47 models are not linearly separable. Therefore, we compare eight LDFs by the best models with the minimum error rate mean in the validation sample (M2) and obtain good results. Although we could not explain the useful meaning of the 95 % CI of discriminant coefficient until now, the pass/fail determination using examination scores provide a clear understanding by normalizing the coefficient in Chap. 5. Seven LDFs become trivial LDFs. Only Fisherâ€™s LDF is not trivial. Seven LDFs are Revised IP-OLDF based on MNM, Revised LP-OLDF, Revised IPLP-OLDF, three SVMs, and logistic regression. We successfully explain the meaning of coefficient. Therefore, we discuss the relationship between the best model and coefficient more precisely by Swiss banknote data in Chap. 6. We study LSD discrimination by Swiss banknote data, Student linearly separable data in Chap. 4, six pass/fail determinations using examination scores in Chap. 5, and Japanese-automobile data in Chap. 7, precisely. When we discriminate six microarray datasets that are LSD in Chap. 8, only Revised IP-OLDF can naturally make feature-selection and reduce the high-dimensional gene space to the small gene space drastically. In gene analysis, we call all linearly separable models, â€œMatroska.â€ The full model is the largest Matroska that includes all smaller Matroskas in it. As we already knew, the smallest Matroska (BGS) can explain the Matroska structure completely through the monotonic decrease of MNM. We propose the Matroska feature-selection method for the microarray dataset (Method 2). Because LSD discrimination is no longer popular, we explain Method 2 through detailed examples of the Swiss banknote and Japanese-automobile data. On the other hand, LASSO attempts to make feature-selection. If it cannot find the small Matroska (SM) in the dataset, it cannot explain the Matroska structure. Swiss banknote data, Japanese-automobile data, and six microarray datasets are helpful for evaluating the usefulness of other feature-selection methods, including LASSO.",2016,
Planktonic larval duration and settlement marks on the otoliths of Mediterranean littoral fishes,"Abstract. The planktonic larval duration (PLD) was estimated for 42 species of littoral fishes from the north-western Mediterranean Sea. Daily increments and settlement marks on the otoliths (sagittae or lapilli) of new settlers and post-settlers were used to determine the larval stage duration. We also used PLD in the new settlers of some species to confirm the accuracy of the settlement marks in post-settlers. The duration of the planktonic larval stage ranges from 9Â days in Symphodus ocellatus to 55Â days in Xyrichtis novacula and 71Â days in Lipophrys trigloides. Species in the same family did not display any clear tendency toward having similar PLDs. On the other hand, larval duration tended to be similar within a genus, with the exception of Lipophrys. Among conspecifics, the time spent in the plankton usually varied only by 2â€“7Â days, except in Aidablennius sphynx, Lipophrys trigloides, Coris julis and Thalassoma pavo. No clear patterns were discernible in genera, with some species that settled in winter and other species that settled in summer, although we observed a certain tendency of individuals of closely related species (e.g. family Sparidae) to have a shorter larval duration in the warmer part of the year than in the colder part of the year. Settlement marks have been observed on the otoliths of all the species studied, and the PLDs in new settlers are an appropriate means of validating settlement marks. A rapid decrease in increment width over settlement (typeÂ Ia) is the most common type of mark (66.7% of the total species studied).",2001,Marine Biology
quantile regression processes under dependence and penalization,"We consider quantile regression processes from censored data under dependent data structures and derive a uniform Bahadur representation for those processes. We also consider cases where the dimension of the parameter in the quantile regression model is large. It is demonstrated that traditional penalization methods such as the adaptive lasso yield sub-optimal rates if the coefficients of the quantile regression cross zero. New penalization techniques are introduced which are able to deal with specific problems of censored data and yield estimates with an optimal rate. In contrast to most of the literature, the asymptotic analysis does not require the assumption of independent observations, but is based on rather weak assumptions, which are satisfied for many kinds of dependent data.",2012,
"The ECF sigma factor, PSPTO_1043, in Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 is induced by oxidative stress and regulates genes involved in oxidative stress response","The bacterial plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae adapts to changes in the environment by modifying its gene expression profile. In many cases, the response is mediated by the activation of extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factors that direct RNA polymerase to transcribe specific sets of genes. In this study we focus on PSPTO_1043, one of ten ECF sigma factors in P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (DC3000). PSPTO_1043, together with PSPTO_1042, encode an RpoERsp/ChrR-like sigma/anti-sigma factor pair. Although this gene pair is unique to the P. syringae group among the pseudomonads, homologous genes can be found in photosynthetic genera such as Rhodospirillum, Thalassospira, Phaeospirillum and Parvibaculum. Using ChIP-Seq, we detected 137 putative PSPTO_1043 binding sites and identified a likely promoter motif. We characterized 13 promoter candidates, six of which regulate genes that appear to be found only in P. syringae. PSPTO_1043 responds to the presence of singlet oxygen (1O2) and tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBOOH) and several of the genes regulated by PSPTO_1043 appear to be involved in response to oxidative stress.",2017,PLoS ONE
Monotone splines lasso,"The important problems of variable selection and estimation in nonparametric additive regression models for high-dimensional data are addressed. Several methods have been proposed to model nonlinear relationships when the number of covariates exceeds the number of observations by using spline basis functions and group penalties. Nonlinear monotone effects on the response play a central role in many situations, in particular in medicine and biology. The monotone splines lasso (MS-lasso) is constructed to select variables and estimate effects using monotone splines (I-splines). The additive components in the model are represented by their I-spline basis function expansion and the component selection becomes that of selecting the groups of coefficients in the I-spline basis function expansion. A recent procedure, called cooperative lasso, is used to select sign-coherent groups, i.e. selecting the groups with either exclusively non-negative or non-positive coefficients. This leads to the selection of important covariates that have nonlinear monotone increasing or decreasing effect on the response. An adaptive version of the MS-lasso reduces both the bias and the number of false positive selections considerably. The MS-lasso and the adaptive MS-lasso are compared with other existing methods for variable selection in high dimensions by simulation and the methods are applied to two relevant genomic data sets. Results indicate that the (adaptive) MS-lasso has excellent properties compared to the other methods both in terms of estimation and selection, and can be recommended for high-dimensional monotone regression.",2014,Comput.

First Steps in DATA MINING with SAS ENTERPRISE MINER,"SAS Enterprise Miner streamlines the data mining process to create highly accurate predictive and descriptive models based on analysis of vast amounts of data from across an enterprise. Data mining is applicable in a variety of industries and provides methodologies for such diverse business problems as fraud detection, householding, customer retention and attrition, database marketing, market segmentation, risk analysis, affinity analysis, customer satisfaction, bankruptcy prediction, and portfolio analysis. In SAS Enterprise Miner, the data mining process has the following (SEMMA) steps: Sample the data by creating one or more data sets. The sample should be large enough to contain significant information, yet small enough to process. This step includes the use of data preparation tools for data import, merge, append, and filter, as well as statistical sampling techniques. Explore the data by searching for relationships, trends, and anomalies in order to gain understanding and ideas. This step includes the use of tools for statistical reporting and graphical exploration, variable selection methods, and variable clustering. Modify the data by creating, selecting, and transforming the variables to focus the model selection process. This step includes the use of tools for defining transformations, missing value handling, value recoding, and interactive binning. Model the data by using the analytical tools to train a statistical or machine learning model to reliably predict a desired outcome. This step includes the use of techniques such as linear and logistic regression, decision trees, neural networks, partial least squares, LARS and LASSO, nearest neighbor, and importing models defined by other users or even outside SAS Enterprise Miner. Assess the data by evaluating the usefulness and reliability of the findings from the data mining process. This step includes the use of tools for comparing models and computing new fit statistics, cutoff analysis, decision support, report generation, and score code management. You might or might not include all of the SEMMA steps in an analysis, and it might be necessary to repeat one or more of the steps several times before you are satisfied with the results. After you have completed the SEMMA steps, you can apply a scoring formula from one or more champion models to new data that might or might not contain the target variable. Scoring new data that is not available at the time of model training is the goal of most data mining problems. Furthermore, advanced visualization tools enable you to quickly and easily examine large amounts of data in multidimensional histograms and to graphically compare modeling results.",2014,
A Statistical Note on Analyzing and Interpreting Individual-Level Epidemiological Data,"With the development of information technology and growing interest in collaboration with medical research, chances to analyze or interpret individual-level data have increased in the past decades, and such individual-level studies tend to be large-scale. It is important to know that even with large samples, analysis is often limited by few numbers of events and difficulty in interpreting P-values. In this article, we will argue several points that researchers should consider to correctly analyze and interpret individual-level data, and we will suggest some statistical methods for practitioners. 
 
The first issue is Cox regression modeling with rare events. Parameters of interest can be estimated by the maximum likelihood method. Unfortunately, however, it is well known that the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) becomes unreliable under â€œmonotone likelihoodâ€ (ie, during the iterative calculation, the likelihood converges while some estimated parameters diverge to infinity).1 For a simple univariate case, such monotone likelihood occurs when a failed individual with the rare event has the highest or lowest value for a covariate in the risk set at each failure time, which also happens in the case of a linear combination of independent variables.1,2 The resultant estimates commonly produce large estimates and standard errors (SE). Although monotone likelihood is not rare and is likely to occur even with large samples, few authors tend to address this phenomenon.1 
 
The same problem occurs in logistic regression models. Although the logistic regression model can always have at least one global maximum because of concavity of log-likelihood,3 failure of convergence (ie, monotone likelihood, also known as â€œcomplete separationâ€ in logistic regression models) may occur when a linear combination of variables can perfectly predict the outcome.4,5 For example, in the simplest situation, if there is a zero cell in the 2 Ã— 2 table formulated by dichotomous independent and dependent variables, maximum likelihood fails to converge. As a more general example, let us suppose that a large dataset has dummy variables, including five age categories and four job categories (ie, 5 Ã— 4 = 20 categories). Under such conditions, it is reasonable to assume that everyone lacks the expected outcome for at least one category. This example produces large odds ratios and huge SEs, letting Wald-type chi-squared statistics approach zero. Although most statistical packages give an alert in such cases, researchers should pay attention when they encounter large odds ratios and confidence intervals (CIs). To diagnose whether the model is suffering from monotone likelihood, we suggest that researchers apply a simple and conventional â€œrule of 10 events per variableâ€, where each independent variable should contain at least 10 events in the use of logistic or Cox regression models.6 
 
A possible solution for handling rare events would be to drop the variables suspected to cause monotone likelihood. However, we do not recommend this method because the omitted variables may have strong power to predict the outcome. Instead, it is preferable to rearrange the categories or to revert to an originally continuous variable. Another solution is to apply an exact logistic regression model, Bayesian estimation, or a penalized maximum likelihood (PML) method, which we can be easily implemented with R and SAS.5,7â€“9 Since the exact logistic regression bases the inference on exact permutational distributions of the sufficient statistics for regression coefficients of interest, performing logistic regression sometimes becomes a computer-intensive task when working with a large dataset.10 The Bayesian method requires a prior distribution, and the estimates are sensitive to the choice of the prior distribution. The PML method imposes penalty terms for parameters with an ordinal likelihood term. Applying Jeffreyâ€™s prior penalty (log determinant of the Fisher information of the parameters11) is popular in the PML method. To handle the perfect separation problem in the case of high-dimensional data with rare events, ridge and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) methods are also recommended. The ridge and LASSO methods shrink regression coefficients toward zero to improve the predictive ability, but the shrinkage leads to bias in exchange for the variance (ie, bias-variance trade-off).7 Therefore, debiasing must be performed for shrinkage estimators, such as re-calculation of coefficients which are estimated to be non-zero, to get unbiased estimates.7 
 
The second issue is the interpretation of P-values for statistical tests with large samples. It is common to depend only on the P-values to detect important exposure variables. However, over-reliance on P-values may lead to accepting the hypothesis with no or little significance for medical practitioners. We frequently observe articles presenting many small P-values such as â€œP < 0.001â€. A P-value measures the distance between estimates (eg, odds ratios) and the null hypothesis using the unit of SE. Therefore, P-values derived from statistical tests, such as t-tests and chi-squared tests, can be formulated as a function of a sample size (ie, as the sample size increases, the CIs narrow) and the SE (ie, as SEs decrease, the CIs narrow). Large samples tend to yield smaller P-values (approaching zero) and larger likelihood of rejecting the null hypothesis with higher statistical power, even if the difference has no practical meaning. Statistical proof can be found elsewhere.12 Despite this property, many studies adhere to the conventional significance threshold of P < 0.05. One way to solve this problem is to stop using statistical tests and report only their point estimates and 95% CIs13 and let the readers interpret the significance of the findings. In using large-scale and individual-level data, researchers should interpret the results with caution by using these suggested techniques.",2015,Journal of Epidemiology

Efficient Regularized Piecewise-Linear Regression Trees,"We present a detailed analysis of the class of regression decision tree algorithms which employ a regulized piecewise-linear node-splitting criterion and have regularized linear models at the leaves. From a theoretic standpoint, based on Rademacher complexity framework, we present new high-probability upper bounds for the generalization error for the proposed classes of regularized regression decision tree algorithms, including LASSO-type, and $\ell_{2}$ regularization for linear models at the leaves. Theoretical result are further extended by considering a general type of variable selection procedure. Furthermore, in our work we demonstrate that the class of piecewise-linear regression trees is not only numerically stable but can be made tractable via an algorithmic implementation, presented herein, as well as with the help of modern GPU technology.

Conquering Minds: Konungs skuggsiÃ¡ and the Annexation of Iceland in the Thirteenth Century,"EN PEIR HAKON KONUNGUR og Skuli jarl gerdu Snorra lendan mann sin. Var pad mest rad peirra jrals og Snorra. En Snorri skyldi leita vid Islendinga ad peir snerust til hlydni vid Noregshbdbingja (Sturl. 263) (1) [""But King Hakon and Jarl Skuli then made Snorri their landed-man, and Snorri and the jarl were chiefly responsible for this. But Snorri was then to try to persuade the Icelanders to give themselves into the protection of the Norwegian rulers"" (Sturlunga saga, McGrew 172)]. Thus reads the Sturlunga saga on the reason for Snorri's return to Iceland in 1220. Partly because of the strong opposition Snorri faced and his lack of enthusiasm for proselytizing, this attempt to render Iceland loyal to the Norwegian crown proved unsuccessful (HsH 59). (2) Nonetheless it was repeated throughout the following decades. Like new Theobrands, (3) Icelandic chieftains loyal to the king were regularly sent back to Iceland entrusted with the task of persuading Icelanders to pay taxes and swear allegiance to the king of Norway: Sturla Sigh-vatsson in 1235; Tord Sighvatsson in 1247; Porgils Skaroi Bodvarsson, Finnbjorn Helgason, and Gissur Torvaldsson in the mid-1250s; and Hravn Oddson in the 1260s. Finally, in 1262-64, Icelanders submitted to the Norwegian crown (Sturl. 2: 319). The aim and strategy pursued by the Norwegian king in Iceland in the mid-thirteenth century was of annexation through persuasion. While the embassy of officials represented one block in the king's strategy, the king relied equally on the weapon of political propaganda to influence the Icelandic population to accept royal authority. This study aims to explore the role of political literature in this enterprise. In particular I will examine a work written between 1240 and 1260 at the court of King Hakon Hakonsson: Konungs skuggsia [The King's Mirror]. I will argue in this article that this text was used as propaganda for the Norwegian king's policy of expansion in Iceland. I contend that the work addressed the political situation in Iceland before its annexation. At that time, Iceland was torn apart by internal feuds and political rivalry. This instability was greatly profitable for the Norwegian monarchy, which endeavored to increase its authority on the island or indeed simply to annex it. In the following, I will examine in particular an allegory present in Konungs skuggsia known as the allegory of the sun and the winds in order to show that it was used to promote an ideology of peace favorable to the Norwegian monarchy in Iceland. The present article also explores the circumstances under which this strategy of propaganda was developed. It concerns the means of communication. The chain of royal propaganda involved different agents who intervened in the emission, transmission, and reception of the ideas promoted by the Norwegian monarchy. Who were they? For propaganda to be effective, it must be built on a foundation already present in society and its population: to quote Jacques Ellul, ""all propaganda must respond to a need"" (Ellul 36-7). The themes developed in the allegory of the sun and the winds echoed important themes and topics in Icelandic society. I will study the conditions for royal propaganda to develop in Iceland and the need to which it responded. THE NORWEGIAN POLICY OF EXPANSION IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC In the High Middle Ages, the Norwegian kingship was engaged in a process of state formation (Bagge, From Viking). On the mainland, this process found expression in the strengthening of royal control over Norwegian society by binding the lay aristocracy to the king's service and building up both a local and a centralized administrative apparatus. However, the consolidation of royal power also concerned overseas territories (Imsen, Grenseland 142-62). In the early thirteenth century, the Norwegian kings strove to strengthen their control over the Norse settlements in the North Atlantic region. In the 1260s, the Norwegian king ruled over the largest thalassocracy of the time, which was also the largest kingdom of Europe in geographical terms. â€¦",2012,Scandinavian Studies
Feature Selection via Co-regularized Sparse-Group Lasso,"We propose the co-regularized sparse-group lasso algorithm: a technique that allows the incorporation of auxiliary information into the learning task in terms of â€œgroupsâ€ and â€œdistancesâ€ among the predictors. The proposed algorithm is particularly suitable for a wide range of biological applications where good predictive performance is required and, in addition to that, it is also important to retrieve all relevant predictors so as to deepen the understanding of the underlying biological process. Our cost function requires related groups of predictors to provide similar contributions to the final response, and thus, guides the feature selection process using auxiliary information. We evaluate the proposed method on a synthetic dataset and examine various settings where its application is beneficial in comparison to the standard lasso, elastic net, group lasso and sparse-group lasso techniques. Last but not least, we make a python implementation of our algorithm available for download and free to use (Available at www.learning-machines.com).",2016,
GWAS identifies novel SLE susceptibility genes and explains the association of the HLA region,"In a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of individuals of European ancestry afflicted with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) the extensive utilization of imputation, step-wise multiple regression, lasso regularization and increasing study power by utilizing false discovery rate instead of a Bonferroni multiple test correction enabled us to identify 13 novel non-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes and confirmed the association of four genes previously reported to be associated. Novel genes associated with SLE susceptibility included two transcription factors (EHF and MED1), two components of the NF-ÎºB pathway (RASSF2 and RNF114), one gene involved in adhesion and endothelial migration (CNTN6) and two genes involved in antigen presentation (BIN1 and SEC61G). In addition, the strongly significant association of multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the HLA region was assigned to HLA alleles and serotypes and deconvoluted into four primary signals. The novel SLE-associated genes point to new directions for both the diagnosis and treatment of this debilitating autoimmune disease.",2014,Genes and immunity
Understand driver awareness through brake behavior analysis: Reactive versus intended hard brake,"Driving is a highly dynamic activity where drivers' awareness to the traffic environment plays the essential role for successful performance. Easy, smooth driving depends on drivers' awareness to develop situation-specific expectations, where infrequent or unexpected situations are not taken into account. Understanding these unexpected situations provides important insight on driver situation awareness and accident prevention. This study takes advantage of recent development of wearable devices and uses driver physiological signals to identify such unexpected situations during driver hard brake. Based on a naturalistic driving dataset, we define two types of hard brake behavior: reactive and intended hard brake. The reactive hard brake relates to drivers reacting to unexpected situations that usually leads to deviated physiological signals due to stress. The intended hard brake relates to planned maneuver implementation that consists of stable physiological signals. By using the human evaluation, we identified the different situations in which these two types of hard brake occurs. Clear difference is observed between these two groups of situations. Our goal is to identify features that are representative of these two type of road environment, especially the situations where unexpected reactive hard brake happens. Following this direction, we extracted features from Lidar depth scanner to represent the road scene, and applied both lasso regression and logistic regression classifier for feature analysis. The regression model achieves high correlation of 0.77 between the prediction and the ground truth while the classification achieves F-score of 0.76. The selected Lidar features can serve as high level road scene representation that facilitate next generation advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) to prevent accident in unexpected traffic scenarios.",2017,2017 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)

"Ensamblajes de peces arrecifales y su relaciÃ³n con el hÃ¡bitat bentÃ³nico de la Isla Isabel, Nayarit, MÃ©xico","This study describes the reef fish assemblages of Isabel Island and their relation with the benthos heterogeneity. A total of 39 visual transects from 19 different localities were performed in the zones North, South, East, and West around the island during December 2002, October 2004, and April 2005. The species composition and their abundance were registered in each transect. Video-transects were also performed to estimate the cover of benthic morpho-functional groups. A total of 9,956 specimens of fishes belonging to 118 species, 85 genera, and 51 families were registered. The 58.3% of the species have biogeographic affinity to the Panamic province. Six endemic species of the Mexican Pacific were registered, including two species endemic to the Gulf of California. According to the biological value index seven species were dominant in the island: Thalassoma lucasanum, Prionurus punctatus, Stegastes flavilatus, Halichoeres dispilus, Acanthurus xanthopterus, Abudefduf troschelii, and Johnrandallia nigrirostris. The indexes of diversity and evenness were not significantly different between the four zones of the island. However, there was a relation between the zones with higher biodiversity (South and East) and some components of the benthic habitat. The principal component analysis found that the cover of corals and rocks are highly related with the dominant species of the island, while the zones with highest proportion of sand, sponges, and gorgonians have less influence on fish diversity.",2010,Revista De Biologia Marina Y Oceanografia
Factors associated with opioid cessation: a machine learning approach,"Background and Aims People with opioid use disorder (OUD) can stop using opioids on their own, with help from groups and with treatment, but there is limited research on the factors that influence opioid cessation. Methods We employed multiple machine learning prediction algorithms (LASSO, random forest, deep neural network, and support vector machine) to assess factors associated with ceasing opioid use in a sample comprised of African Americans (AAs) and European Americans (EAs) who met DSM-5 criteria for mild to severe OUD. Values for several thousand demographic, alcohol and other drug use, general health, and behavioral variables, as well as diagnoses for other psychiatric disorders, were obtained for each participant from a detailed semi-structured interview. Results Support vector machine models performed marginally better on average than those derived using other machine learning methods with maximum prediction accuracies of 75.4% in AAs and 79.4% in EAs. Subsequent stepwise regression analyses that considered the 83 most highly ranked variables across all methods and models identified less recent cocaine use (p<5Ã—10âˆ’8), a shorter duration of opioid use (p<5Ã—10âˆ’6), and older age (p<5Ã—10âˆ’9) as the strongest independent predictors of opioid cessation. Factors related to drug use comprised about half of the significant independent predictors, with other predictors related to non-drug use behaviors, psychiatric disorders, overall health, and demographics. Conclusions These proof-of-concept findings provide information that can help develop strategies for improving OUD management and the methods we applied provide a framework for personalizing OUD treatment.",2019,bioRxiv
Continuation of Nesterovâ€™s Smoothing for Regression With Structured Sparsity in High-Dimensional Neuroimaging,"Predictive models can be used on high-dimensional brain images to decode cognitive states or diagnosis/prognosis of a clinical condition/evolution. Spatial regularization through structured sparsity offers new perspectives in this context and reduces the risk of overfitting the model while providing interpretable neuroimaging signatures by forcing the solution to adhere to domain-specific constraints. Total variation (TV) is a promising candidate for structured penalization: it enforces spatial smoothness of the solution while segmenting predictive regions from the background. We consider the problem of minimizing the sum of a smooth convex loss, a non-smooth convex penalty (whose proximal operator is known) and a wide range of possible complex, non-smooth convex structured penalties such as TV or overlapping group Lasso. Existing solvers are either limited in the functions they can minimize or in their practical capacity to scale to high-dimensional imaging data. Nesterovâ€™s smoothing technique can be used to minimize a large number of non-smooth convex structured penalties. However, reasonable precision requires a small smoothing parameter, which slows down the convergence speed to unacceptable levels. To benefit from the versatility of Nesterovâ€™s smoothing technique, we propose a first order continuation algorithm, CONESTA, which automatically generates a sequence of decreasing smoothing parameters. The generated sequence maintains the optimal convergence speed toward any globally desired precision. Our main contributions are: gap to probe the current distance to the global optimum in order to adapt the smoothing parameter and the To propose an expression of the duality convergence speed. This expression is applicable to many penalties and can be used with other solvers than CONESTA. We also propose an expression for the particular smoothing parameter that minimizes the number of iterations required to reach a given precision. Furthermore, we provide a convergence proof and its rate, which is an improvement over classical proximal gradient smoothing methods. We demonstrate on both simulated and high-dimensional structural neuroimaging data that CONESTA significantly outperforms many state-of-the-art solvers in regard to convergence speed and precision.",2018,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging
VACTERL-association: An unusual case of fetus detected by ultrasound screening at 19 weeks of gestation,"Sir: The VATER-associat ion is a nonrandom occurrence of defects originally described by Quan and Smith, designating Vertebral defects, Anal atresia, Tracheo-Esophageal fistula with esophageal atresia, Renal defects and Radial limb dysplasia. It has been expanded to VACTERLassociation by including associated Cardiac defects and Limb anomalies [1, 2]. We report on an unusual fetal complication of VACTERL-associat ion intestinal volvulus: Oligohydramnios and a greatly enlarged fetal abdomen indicated abnormal fetal development on ultrasound screening at 19 weeks of gestation. It was the first pregnancy of an unmarried 21-year-old healthy woman; ol igomennorrhoea was her only complaint. There was no history of an intake of sex hormones. The 26-year-old father is also healthy. Family histories were negative for multiple spontaneous abortions, early infant deaths, or infants with congenital anomalies. After the initial ultrasound finding the women was referred to our prenatal diagnosis clinic. Sonographic evaluation showed an enormously enlarged abdomen, heavily compressed lungs, a large cystic area filling the whole fetal abdominal cavity, enlarged bowel loops with thickened walls and weak peristaltic movements, dilated renal collecting system, irregular shape of thoracic vertebrae, and a two-vessel umbilical cord. The combination of defects suggested the diagnosis of VATER-associat ion with poor prognosis for survival. At 20 weeks of gestation the mother decided on termination. Post-mortem examination showed a greatly enlarged abdomen, splayed ribs, partial cutaneous syndactyly of fingers I I -V , transposition of the external genitalia with hypoplastic penis, and an absent anal orifice (Fig. 1).

SASeq: A Selective and Adaptive Shrinkage Approach to Detect and Quantify Condition-Specific Transcripts using RNA-Seq,"Detection and quantification of condition-specific transcripts using RNA-Seq is a central task to transcriptomics research. Initial efforts on mathematical or statistical modeling of read counts or per-base exonic expression signal have been successful but may face an increasing risk of model misspecification and overfitting. This is because the number of reference transcripts in the database is much larger than that of the condition-specific transcripts expressed under a single biological condition, and the difference is getting larger with the accelerated augmentation of transcripts database. To improve the prediction accuracy, a subset of candidate condition-specific transcripts may be selected at the same time of estimating their relative abundances. The standard shrinkage approaches, such as Lasso, select condition-specific transcripts by shrinking all the transcript abundances to zero. However, the blind shrinkage does not necessarily lead to the set of condition-specific transcripts. Informed shrinkage approaches, motivated by exonic coverage signal, are thus desirable.",2012,
Machine Learning : An Applied Econometric Approach Online Appendix,"In this section, we detail the procedure by which we obtain predictions for common machine-learning predictors. Throughout, we use out-of-the box prediction algorithms that are readily implemented in R; rather than discussing how any of the algorithms are implemented, we therefore focus solely on how to tune, combine and evaluate them. Our general approach realizes the main structure that is common to many supervised learning algorithms â€“ namely regularization with empirical choice of the tuning parameters â€“ but leaves many margins of improvement for specific prediction methods, such as strategies to improve regularization (e.g. pruning for trees), tricks to speed up obtaining loss estimates for many tuning parameters simultaneously (e.g. growing larger trees and forests from existing smaller trees and forests), or specific rules to choose the regularization parameter after cross-validation (e.g. the â€œone standard error ruleâ€ for the LASSO and other methods).",2017,
"Oracle Properties, Bias Correction, and Bootstrap Inference for Adaptive Lasso for Time Series Mâ€Estimators","We derive new theoretical results on the properties of the adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (adaptive lasso) for possibly nonlinear time series models. In particular, we investigate the question of how to conduct inference on the parameters given an adaptive lasso model. Central to this study is the test of the hypothesis that a given adaptive lasso parameter equals zero, which therefore tests for a false positive. To this end, we introduce a recentered bootstrap procedure and show, theoretically and empirically through extensive Monte Carlo simulations, that the adaptive lasso can combine efficient parameter estimation, variable selection, and inference in one step. Moreover, we analytically derive a bias correction factor that is able to significantly improve the empirical coverage of the test on the active variables. Finally, we apply the adaptive lasso and the recentered bootstrap procedure to investigate the relation between the short rate dynamics and the economy, thereby providing a statistical foundation (from a model choice perspective) for the classic Taylor rule monetary policy model.",2018,Journal of Time Series Analysis
Evidence for glass 'recycling' using Pb and Sr isotopic ratios and Sr-mixing lines: the case of early Byzantine Sagalassos,"Abstract The secondary production (working) of glass from imperial to early Byzantine times has been proven at the ancient city of Sagalassos (SW Turkey) by the existence of glass chunks, fuel ash slag and kiln fragments related to glass processing. It had been previously suggested that local green glass might have been recycled from two other locally found glass types (blue glass vessels and chunks and HIMT glass chunks). This paper provides analytical evidence for the recycling of glass next to the use of imported raw glass. The heterogeneous lead isotopic composition of the green and HIMT vessel glass at Sagalassos, with as end members on the one hand the isotopic composition of local blue glass vessels and chunks and on the other hand that of the HIMT glass chunks, could indicate the production of â€˜recycledâ€™ glass, although heterogeneous raw materials could have been used. However, the use of Sr-mixing lines confirms local recycling. It is clear that the Sr in the green and HIMT vessels is a mixture of the Sr in the aforementioned end members. It cannot be proved whether the green â€˜recycledâ€™ glass was produced from a mixture of chunks alone, or from a mixture of cullet and chunks. Suggestions are made towards the possible origin of the raw materials for the blue and HIMT glass on the basis of Sr isotopic signatures and absolute Sr contents in the glass.",2006,Journal of Archaeological Science
The electronic states of cyclopropane studied by (VUV) absorption and electron energy-loss spectroscopies,"Absolute optical (VUV) absorption cross sections for cyclopropane have been measured from 5.0 to 11.2 and 20-40 eV using synchrotron radiation. Also, electron energy-loss (EEL) spectra have been obtained using incident electrons of (a) 150 eV energy scattered through small angles (energy loss 5.0-15 eV) and (b) near-threshold energies scattered through large angles (energy loss 0-10.5 eV). Taken together these confirm that the low-lying excited electronic states of cyclopropane are of Rydberg type and, although spectral bands are diffuse, a known Rydberg series has been extended. Recent computations (Galasso V 1996 Chem. Phys. 206 289) appear to give a good account of the experimental spectrum from threshold to about 11 eV, but these must be extended if valence-excited states are to be characterized. Particular attention has been directed at the evaluation of absolute optical cross sections. These are now believed to be established over the energy ranges 5-15 and 20-40 eV. In the gap region (15-20 eV) second-order radiation may affect the optical measurements. From consideration of second-order effects, and comparison of the present studies with earlier measurements, we propose a best-estimate cross section in this energy region also.",1999,Journal of Physical Chemistry B

Efficient approximate leave-one-out cross-validation for ridge and lasso,"In this thesis an approximation method is discussed that provides similar results to leave-one-out cross-validation but is less time-consuming. By means of this approximation method, estimating the optimal values of ridge and lasso parameters will take less time and carrying out (an approximated version of) double LOOCV will become practically feasible.

Safe preselection in lasso-type problems by cross-validation freezing,"We propose a new approach to safe variable preselection in high-dimensional penalized regression, such as the lasso. Preselection - to start with a manageable set of covariates - has often been implemented without clear appreciation of its potential bias. Based on sequential implementation of the lasso with increasing lists of predictors, we find a new property of the set of corresponding cross-validation curves, a pattern that we call freezing. It allows to determine a subset of covariates with which we reach the same lasso solution as would be obtained using the full set of covariates. Freezing has not been characterized before and is different from recently discussed safe rules for discarding predictors. We demonstrate by simulation that ranking predictors by their univariate correlation with the outcome, leads in a majority of cases to early freezing, giving a safe and efficient way of focusing the lasso analysis on a smaller and manageable number of predictors. We illustrate the applicability of our strategy in the context of a GWAS analysis and on microarray genomic data. Freezing offers great potential for extending the applicability of penalized regressions to ultra highdimensional data sets.

Tra terra e mare : un approdo lungo la Costa delle miniere,"INTRODUZIONE 
1.1.1 Lâ€™ARCHEOLOGIA INDUSTRIALE 
E una branca dellâ€™archeologia, che studia, attraverso un metodo dâ€™indagine multidisciplinare (toccando architettura, sociologia, urbanistica, tecnologia e storia dellâ€™arte,) â€œtutti i resti materiali di quelle forme di produzione urbane e rurali derivanti dagli innovamenti tecnologici introdotti nel periodo della rivoluzione industriale o antecedenti, funzionali in maniera diretta o subalterna ai meccanismi di sviluppo e di riproduzione dellâ€™industria e del suo capitaleâ€. Si tratta dunque di una disciplina, che interessa un campo molto vasto, ma il cui punto di riferimento e offerto dal mondo di produzione capitalistico e i suoi punti cardine, ossia, il capitale e la forza lavoro. Il suo oggetto di studio e quindi il patrimonio archeologico industriale, lâ€™insieme dei manufatti che hanno contribuito alla creazione del paesaggio urbano industriale che si delineo a partire dal XVIII secolo e che sono testimonianze del processo di trasformazione dellâ€™ambiente e della societa indotto della rivoluzione industriale. Possono far parte di questa definizione le aree industriali abbandonate o dismesse, miniere, tonnare, stazioni ferroviarie, officine, depositi, reti di strade, canali, ponti, gallerie, cave e villaggi operai, tutti elementi dove il â€œcapitaleâ€ e la â€œforza lavoroâ€ hanno attivato processi che hanno portato alla formazione di beni o di servizi legati alla produzione. Non bisogna pero considerare il solo patrimonio materiale, ma anche gli elementi immateriali come la memoria scritta e orale, le tradizioni, le forme del sapere tecnico e i modi di produzione, ovvero â€œun insieme, composto da tutto quello che deriva dallâ€™intreccio tra lâ€™attivita industriale, lâ€™ambito territoriale, i gruppi umaniâ€. 
Il campo di studi e dunque molto vasto e multiforme e sono numerose le ricerche che hanno animato lâ€™attivita dei primi studiosi anglosassoni negli anni successivi al secondo conflitto mondiale, contribuendo ad avvicinare lâ€™opinione pubblica, soprattutto in Europa, ai temi legati ai luoghi della produzione favorendo la nascita di nuovi interessi culturali per questi luoghi e per gli oggetti appartenenti a questo settore del lavoro umano. Lâ€™Archeologia Industriale non puo aver ne un limite temporale preciso, tramite il quale datare un manufatto o un impianto produttivo per inserirlo nella materia, ne parametri attraverso i quali stabilire cosa entri nel suo campo dâ€™indagine. In generale si puo affermare che essa debba occuparsi dello â€œstudio dei documenti del lavoro dellâ€™uomoâ€, intesi soprattutto come resti fisici presenti sul territorio. In questo modo la materia abbraccia un ampissimo lasso di tempo, riallacciandosi alla piu tradizionale archeologia nel senso di â€œstudio delle civilta del passatoâ€. Un altra teoria, invece, classifica come resti del nostro passato industriale quelli appartenenti ad un periodo che parte dalla seconda meta del XVIII secolo, con la Rivoluzione Industriale, considerando come suo punto di partenza virtuale lâ€™Iron Bridge (fig. 1), prima struttura ad arco costruita interamente in metallo a Coalbrookdale Inghilterra nel 1779, simbolo dellâ€™avvento delle macchine nella vita dellâ€™uomo e del costante rapporto tra lâ€™uomo e lâ€™industria, del quale possiamo osservare lâ€™inizio ma non distinguiamo la fine. 
Va detto che questa â€œelasticita storicaâ€, ha comunque i suoi limiti che, seppure non completamente definiti, sono evidenti a unâ€™analisi logica. Lâ€™archeologia industriale si configura quindi come uno strumento di tutela e di valorizzazione degli spazi appartenenti allâ€™epoca industriale in alternativa allâ€™abbandono di questi ultimi ed in ultima analisi, essa puo â€œacquisire una vera rilevanza se lo studio dei resti materiali dellâ€™industrializzazione non sara inteso semplicemente in termini retrospettivi, ma come attivita di identificazione e tutela della fisionomia di un determinato territorio considerato come il risultato di un processo storico tuttora in atto in cui il presente rappresenta il punto di equilibrio tra registrazione del passato e progettazione del futuroâ€. Il grande lasso temporale coperto dallâ€™Archeologia Industriale implica la considerazione di numerosissimi oggetti da salvaguardare, che hanno fortemente caratterizzato il territorio e la cura di questâ€™ultimo deve essere negli obiettivi primari della disciplina, e dunque fondamentale la conservazione delle strutture in quanto manifestazioni materiali e immateriali della storia sociale e sede di arti e mestieri, facendo si che il recupero di una fabbrica diventi il recupero di un intero contesto ambientale e sociale. 
 
1.1.2 Lâ€™ARCHEOLOGIA MINERARIA 
Definisce quella branca dellâ€™archeologia Industriale che si occupa dei resti degli impianti di estrazione, di prima lavorazione, di sintesi e di arricchimento sia chimico che fisico. Lâ€™attivita mineraria ha fortemente caratterizzato il paesaggio sardo disseminato di elementi legati allâ€™attivita estrattiva come gli ingressi delle gallerie, gli scavi a giorno, le immense discariche, gli impianti di estrazione dove emerge come elemento distintivo il castello del pozzo, le laverie per lâ€™arricchimento del minerale e i villaggi (determinati da un rigido criterio gerarchico di distribuzione delle case) che ospitavano le maestranze impegnate nel sottosuolo e loro famiglie. 
Il paesaggio minerario oggetto dâ€™indagine archeologica e di piu semplice identificazione, spaziale e temporale, rispetto ad altri paesaggi industriali, grazie allâ€™insieme di elementi fisici (fabbriche e villaggi degli operai, le strade e i ponti a loro vicini, gli accumuli di materiale lavorato o da lavorare, o qualsiasi modifica al territorio apportata a seguito di unâ€™attivita industriale), ma anche per il â€œnon usoâ€ del territorio gia interessato da questa attivita. Il riutilizzo delle aree, testimoniato dalla stratificazione dei resti fisici di natura e periodi storici diversi, e caratteristica comune a numerosi sistemi produttivi, se non di tutti, ma questa stratificazione puo essere impedita da fattori dipendenti principalmente dallâ€™uomo che vanno a limitare lâ€™attivita industriale, come ad esempio un cambio di destinazione dâ€™uso del territorio circostante lâ€™area industriale o la troppa vicinanza ad un centro abitato. Quindi e lâ€™uomo, spesso solo per ragioni di pura convenienza economica, che influenza piu dâ€™ogni altra forza naturale questi cicli, dando un volto agricolo ai terreni vicini alla fabbrica o modificando completamente un paesaggio di ciminiere o grandi cisterne, sostituendole con alberghi e case residenziali. 
 
1.1.3 NORMATIVE E SALVAGUARDIA DEL PATRIMONIO 
In Italia la salvaguardia dei resti archeologico industriali originariamente era regolamentata dalla Legge speciale n.1089 del giugno 1939, che si interessava di quei resti che per la loro natura, qualita e unicita, hanno acquistato rilevanza giuridica in quanto testimonianze di civilta e cultura. Concepita quasi ottanta anni fa e soprattutto non trattando specificatamente lâ€™archeologia industriale, questa norma risultava oramai lontana dalle esigenze odierne. Questa Legge, nei primi due articoli, riconosce come oggetto della normativa i beni mobili e immobili, sia pubblici che privati. Diverse sentenze dei Tribunali Amministrativi Regionali, hanno tentato di contribuire alla sua innovazione estendendo i principi anche a beni che altrimenti, non vi sarebbero rientrati, nel tentativo di tutelare non tanto il resto fisico quanto il suo valore intrinseco, poiche emblematico d un certo modo di pensare, costruire, abitare, produrre di un periodo passato. 
Conseguenza di questo nuovo atteggiamento nei confronti del passato industriale e stata lâ€™applicazione del corrente D.Lgs 42/2004 per la salvaguardia delle opere dâ€™arte anche ai monumenti industriali. Per ""monumento industrialeâ€ si intende â€œ[...] qualunque edificio o altra struttura fissa, specialmente del periodo della rivoluzione industriale, che in se o associato a impianti o strutture illustra lâ€™inizio e lo sviluppo di processi tecnici e industriali, compresi i mezzi di comunicazione . 
Di seguito si riporta la Definizione di patrimonio culturale (Art.2. comma 1-2-3-4 del Codice Urbani dei Beni Culturali D.Lgs 42/2004): 
1. Il patrimonio culturale e costituito dai beni culturali e dai beni paesaggistici. 
2. Sono beni culturali le cose immobili e mobili che, ai sensi degli artico' 1022, e 1123, presentano interesse artistico, storico, archeologico, etnoantropologico, archivistico e bibliografico e le altre cose individuate dalla legge o in base alla legge quali testimonianze aventi valore di civilta. 
3. Sono beni paesaggistici gli immobili e le aree indicati allâ€™Articolo 13424, costituenti espressione dei valori storici, culturali, naturali, morfologici ed estetici del territorio, e gli altri beni individuati dalla legge o in base alla legge. 
4. I beni del patrimonio culturale di appartenenza pubblica sono destina ' alla fruizione della collettivita, compatibilmente con le esigenze di uso istituzionale e sempre che non vi ostino ragioni di tutela. 
I beni culturali della civilta industriale vanno considerati quindi in relazione al loro specifico spazio, tempo, contesto culturale e paesaggistico in quanto il bene archeo-industriale e strettamente legato al suo territorio. La sostenibilita e lâ€™attuazione degli interventi sono influenzate da problemi di tipo ambientale, economico e normativo e per uno sviluppo sostenibile si deve quindi mirare allâ€™equilibrio tra questi fattori tenendo conto della collocazione ambientale e territoriale dei beni archeo-industriali.",2017,
Lung transcriptomic clock predicts premature aging in cigarette smoke-exposed mice,"Lung aging is characterized by a number of structural alterations including fibrosis, chronic inflammation and the alteration of inflammatory cell composition. Chronic exposure to cigarette smoke (CS) is known to induce similar alterations and may contribute to premature lung aging. Additionally, aging and CS exposure are associated with transcriptional alterations in the lung. The current work aims to explore the interaction between age- and CS- associated transcriptomic perturbations and develop a transcriptomic clock able to predict the biological age and the impact of external factors on lung aging. Our investigations revealed a substantial overlap between transcriptomic response to CS exposure and age-related transcriptomic alterations in the murine lung. Of particular interest is the strong upregulation of immunoglobulin genes with increased age and in response to CS exposure, indicating an important implication of B-cells in lung inflammation associated with aging and smoking. Furthermore, we used a machine learning approach based on Lasso regression to build a transcriptomic age model that can accurately predict chronological age in untreated mice and the deviations associated with certain exposures. Interestingly, CS-exposed-mice were predicted to be prematurely aged in contrast to mice exposed to fresh air or to heated tobacco products (HTPs). The accelerated aging rate associated with CS was reversed upon smoking cessation or switching to HTPs. Additionally, our model was able to predict premature aging associated with thoracic irradiation from an independent public dataset. Aging and CS exposure share common transcriptional alteration patterns in the murine lung. The massive upregulation of B-cell restricted genes during these processes shed light on the contribution of cell composition and particularly immune cells to the measured transcriptomic signal. Through machine learning approach, we show that gene expression changes can be used to accurately monitor the biological age and the modulations associated with certain exposures. Our findings also suggest that the premature lung aging is reversible upon the reduction of harmful exposures.",2020,BMC Genomics

Machine Learning Application on H-1B Case Data,"In this paper, we use machine learning techniques to explore the H-1B application dataset disclosed by the Department of Labor (DOL), from 2008 to 2018, in order to provide more stylized facts of the international workers in US labor market. We train a LASSO Regression model to analyze the impact of different features on the applicant's wage, and a Logistic Regression with L1-Penalty as a classifier to study the feature's impact on the likelihood of the case being certified. Our analysis shows that working in the healthcare industry, working in California, higher job level contribute to higher salaries. In the meantime, lower job level, working in the education services industry and nationality of Philippines are negatively correlated with the salaries. In terms of application status, a Ph.D. degree, working in retail or finance, majoring in computer science will give the applicants a better chance of being certified. Applicants with no or an associate degree, working in the education services industry, or majoring in education are more likely to be rejected.",2019,arXiv: Applications

"Spatial and temporal patterns of larval fish distribution in surface waters of La Parguera, Puerto Rico: preliminary report","This study examined distribution patterns of larval fishes in La Parguera Bay and adjacent oceanic waters in Southwestern Puerto Rico, an area of extensive coral reef development. Larval fishes were sampled at the surface with 202 and 750 :m mesh conical plankton nets at five stations along an inshore-offshore gradient. Stations included a shallow mangrove channel off the shoreline, back-reef and fore-reef areas, the shelf-edge reef and one offshore station located two miles off the shelf-edge. A total of 40 families and, at least, 43 species of larval fishes have been identified. The offshore station had the highest number of species, (19 species), most of which were oceanic types. Relatively higher abundance of pre-flexion larvae was found inshore, at the forereef and back-reef stations (means : 45.2 and 40.2 Ind/100m3, respectively). Conversely, more post-flexion larvae was found offshore (mean : 6.30 Ind/100m3). This trend was influenced by the relatively higher abundance of beloniform taxa (flyingfishes, ballyhoo, needlefishes) offshore, which only hatch as post-flexion larvae. Patchiness, occurring at time scales of shorter duration than the monthly sampling interval, appeared to be the dominant feature of temporal variability in total post-flexion and pre-flexion larval abundance. Peaks of significantly higher abundance were observed during different months at each station. There was a synchronized peak of larval fish abundance at the shelf-edge and offshore stations during August. This patch was multispecific in taxonomic composition (11 families), and included a wide range of ontogenetic stages (pre-flexion and post-flexion) of oceanic, as well as reef associated species. The high relative abundance of oceanic taxa in this patch (Exocotidae, Gempylidae, Macrorhamphosidae, Scombridae, Istiophoridae, Nomeidae) suggests an offshore origin. Co-occurrence of reef associated taxa as well (Hemiramphidae, Pomacentridae, Carangidae, Ostracidae) may be indicative of high larval survival in a physically driven offshore retention zone. Proceedings of the 47th Gulf and Caribbean Fisheries Institute 376 INTRODUCTION Spatial and temporal variability patterns of larval fish distributions and abundance, taxonomic composition and ontogeny are fundamental aspects of coral reef fish recruitment dynamics. Such information is critically important in the design and location of seawater intake structures and thermal effluents associated with power plants and other industrial developments, and with formulation of fisheries management strategies directed to protect overexploited stocks from growth and recruitment overfishing (e. g. Polachek 1989; PDT 1990). The self-recruitment potential versus expatriation dichotomy represents one of the main concerns in evaluation of closed fishing areas as a management option for Caribbean coral reef fisheries. Offshore occurrence of coral reef fish larvae in the very few samplings performed in the Caribbean (Richards 1984; Smith et al. 1987) tend to support the generalized theory that reef fishes with planktonic eggs have offshore larval distributions (Leis and Miller 1976; Young et al. 1986). Yet, insular shelf regions with substantial coral reef development in the Caribbean have not been examined, and the relatively low abundance of coral reef fish larvae found in offshore samplings calls for a more comprehensive search for inshore larval distributions and oceanographical processes affecting them. This study aims to provide a baseline description of temporal and spatial variability of larval fish abundance, taxonomic composition and ontogenic distributions along an inshore-offshore gradient in surface waters of La Parguera Bay and adjacent offshore waters. Background and Literature Review Most coral reef fishes reproduce from demersal or planktonic eggs which develop into a planktonic/pelagic larval stage. Duration of the planktonic stage (egg and larvae) varies considerably among species (Brothers et al., 1983; Victor, 1986), as well as the morphological and physiological adaptations of larvae for planktonic life (Smith et al., 1987). Dispersal mechanisms seem to operate at different temporal and spatial scales for different species due to an interplay of factors, such as the duration of planktonic stage, larval morphology and behavior, adult reproductive modes and spawning strategies, and water column hydrography (Richards, 1984, Williams et al., 1984; Shapiro et al., 1988; Williams & English, 1992; Cowen, in press). Consequently, marked inshoreoffshore and vertical gradients in taxonomic composition of reef fish larvae have been noted (Leis & Miller, 1976; Leis, 1982; Young et al., 1986; Yoklavich et al., 1992). Leis & Miller (1976) found that most hawaiian coral reef fishes with planktonic eggs had offshore larval distributions, while those with nonProceedings of the 47th Gulf and Caribbean Fisheries Institute 377 planktonic (demersal or attached) eggs were most commonly found inshore. Similar findings were reported by Young et al., (1986) from cross-shelf transects off Western Australia. Offshore larval distributions of inshore reef fishes had been previously reported for the eastern tropical Pacific (Ahlstrom, 1971, 1972). At present very limited information is available on spatial and temporal variability patterns of abundance and taxonomic distribution of Caribbean coral reef fish larvae. Such information is key to basic understanding of recruitment dynamics and early fish life histories and precludes formulation of management strategies for coral reef associated fisheries, such as the establishment of closed fishing areas. Richards (1984) reported distribution patterns of reef fishes offshore throughout the Caribbean and the southern Gulf of Mexico, but insular shelf zones, and particularly coral reef areas, were in most part excluded from the (MARMAP) sampling scheme. A total of 50 families of inshore fishes were represented offshore in the MARMAP study (Richards 1984), their combined abundance, however, accounted for less than 30 % of the total individuals collected. Inshore reef fish families, such as Scarids, Gobiids, Bothids, and Labrids combined for aproximately 15 % of the total collection. No other family of inshore reef fishes represented more than 1 % of the total collection. Offshore, mesopelagic taxa, such as Scopeliformes, Myctophids, and Gonostomatids accounted for more than 75 % of the total MARMAP bongo net collection. Exocoetids, Mullids, Myctophids and Mugilids were the most abundant families of ichthyoplankton represented in MARMAP neuston samples (Richards 1984). Both mugilids and mullids, along with a few other inshore reef fish families were abundant in offshore neuston collections. Nevertheless, the lack of synoptic samplings inshore precludes any conclusive analysis of distribution patterns of Caribbean coral reef fish larvae from this study. In a preliminary evaluation of inshore and offshore size distributions of Caribbean larval fishes, Smith et al. (1987) noted the presence of a â€˜near field assemblageâ€™, or a group of inshore reef fishes that spend their entire life cycle in the vicinity of Caribbean reefs. Based mostly on the taxonomic distribution of their night-light collections, Smith et al. (1987) suggested that such inshore larval fish assemblage is comprised by only a small number of families. This implies, or raises the hypothesis, that the community structure of Caribbean coral reef fishes is mostly dependant upon recruitment by offshore transported larvae (the far-field assemblage). In such case, an increase of spawning stock biomass in any given coral reef, mediated by closure management strategies (e.g. marine fishery reserves) would have limited influence on a regional basis, unless offshore larval retention areas and/or return mechanisms to natal and/or adjacent Proceedings of the 47th Gulf and Caribbean Fisheries Institute 378 reefs would be operant. Dennis et al. (1991) reported 24 families of larval fishes from night collections in mangrove, seagrass, and inshore coral reef habitats in La Parguera. At present a comprehensive evaluation of inshore larval fish distribution in Caribbean coral reef environments have not been performed. The generalized theory that spawning strategies of most coral reef fishes are adapted to facilitate offshore transport of eggs and larvae (Sale 1970; Emery 1972; Johannes 1978) is poorly substantiated by physical oceanographic data (Shapiro et al. 1988; Leis 1991). Tidal currents have been identified as mechanisms for egg dispersal away from reefs in the Indo-Pacific (Johannes 1978; Robertson 1983; Thresher 1979; Bell and Colin 1986), although net offshore transport has not been demonstrated (Leis 1991). Recent investigations in La Parguera (Shapiro et al. 1988; Appledoorn et al. 1994; Hensley et al. 1994), have tested the hypothesis that pelagically-spawning coral reef fishes select sites and times for spawning that result in eggs being rapidly transported away from reef areas. This study was conducted at San Cristobal, a small inshore reef in La Parguera, using the bluehead wrasse, Thalassoma bifasciatum as a model species. Transport mechanisms (e.g. currents) away from reef sites were greater at non-spawning times than at spawning times, while no significant differences in transport resulted between spawning and non-spawning sites. These results do not support the hypothesis that spawning behavior favors transport of eggs away from reef areas. Little net offshore transport of eggs was observed, due to nightime current reversals associated with drop in wind stress. Indeed, net on-shelf water movement along the bottom during this time was opposite to that observed on the surface (Tyler 1992). These indicate the existence of physically driven mechanisms potentially capable of retaining eggs and larvae inshore. Hatching of Thalassoma eggs spawned a San Cristobal was inferred to occur inshore (Appledoorn et a",2005,
L 1 penalty and shrinkage estimation in partially linear models with random coefficient autoregressive errors,"In partially linear models, we consider methodology for simultaneous model selection and parameter estimation with random coefficient autoregressive errors by using lasso and shrinkage strategies. We provide natural adaptive estimators that significantly improve upon the classical procedures in the situation where some of the predictors are nuisance variables that may or may not affect the association between the response and the main predictors. In the context of two competing partially linear regression models (full and submodels), we consider an adaptive shrinkage estimation strategy and propose the shrinkage estimator and the positive-rule shrinkage estimator. We develop the properties of these estimators by using the notion of asymptotic distributional risk. The shrinkage estimators are shown to have a higher efficiency than the classical estimators for a wide class of models. For the lasso-type estimation strategy, we devise efficient algorithms to obtain numerical results. We compare the relative performance of lasso with the shrinkage estimator and the other estimators. Monte Carlo simulation experiments are conducted for various combinations of the nuisance parameters and sample size, and the performance of each method is evaluated in terms of simulated mean squared error. The comparison reveals that lasso and shrinkage strategies outperform the classical procedure. The relative performance of lasso and shrinkage strategies is comparable. The shrinkage estimators perform better than the lasso strategy in the effective part of the parameter space when, and only when, there are many nuisance variables in the model. A data example is showcased to illustrate the usefulness of suggested methods. Copyright Â© 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",2012,Applied Stochastic Models in Business and Industry
A LASSO-Based Method for Detecting Item-Trait Patterns of Replenished Items in Multidimensional Computerized Adaptive Testing,"Multidimensional computerized adaptive testing (MCAT) is one of the widely discussed topics in psychometrics. Within the context of item replenishment in MCAT, it is important to identify the item-trait pattern for each replenished item, which indicates the set of the latent traits that are measured by each replenished item in the item pool. We propose a pattern recognition method based on the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) to detect the optimal item-trait patterns of the replenished items via an MCAT test. Simulation studies are conducted to investigate the performance of the proposed method in pattern recognition accuracy under different conditions across various latent trait correlation, item discrimination, test lengths, and item selection criteria in the test. Results show that the proposed method can accurately and efficiently identify the item-trait patterns of the replenished items in both the two-dimensional and three-dimensional item pools.",2019,Frontiers in Psychology
Sparse estimation for case-control studies with multiple subtypes of cases.,"The analysis of case-control studies with several subtypes of cases is increasingly common, e.g. in cancer epidemiology. For matched designs, we show that a natural strategy is based on a stratified conditional logistic regression model. Then, to account for the potential homogeneity among the subtypes of cases, we adapt the ideas of data shared lasso, which has been recently proposed for the estimation of regression models in a stratified setting. For unmatched designs, we compare two standard methods based on L1-norm penalized multinomial logistic regression. We describe formal connections between these two approaches, from which practical guidance can be derived. We show that one of these approaches, which is based on a symmetric formulation of the multinomial logistic regression model, actually reduces to a data shared lasso version of the other. Consequently, the relative performance of the two approaches critically depends on the level of homogeneity that exists among the subtypes of cases: more precisely, when homogeneity is moderate to high, the non-symmetric formulation with controls as the reference is not recommended. Empirical results obtained from synthetic data are presented, which confirm the benefit of properly accounting for potential homogeneity under both matched and unmatched designs. We also present preliminary results from the analysis a case-control study nested within the EPIC cohort, where the objective is to identify metabolites associated with the occurrence of subtypes of breast cancer.",2019,arXiv: Methodology
Catecholamine biosynthesis pathway potentially involved in banana defense mechanisms to crown rot disease.,"Variations in Cavendish bananas susceptibility to crown rot disease have been observed (Lassois et al., 2010a), but the molecular mechanisms underlying these quantitative host-pathogen relationships were still unknown. The present study was designed to compare gene expression between bananas (Musa acuminata, AAA, 'Grande-Naine') showing a high post-harvest susceptibility (S+) and bananas showing a low post-harvest susceptibility (S-) to crown rot disease. This comparison was performed between crowns (S+ and S-) collected one hour before standardized artificial inoculations with Colletotrichum musae. Fruit susceptibility was evaluated through lesion size on the crown 13 days later. Gene expression comparisons were performed with the cDNA-AFLP technique (Lassois et al., 2009). This revealed that a gene showing a strong homology with a dopamine-beta-monooxygenase (DoH) is differently expressed between S+ and S (Lassois et al., 2011). Furthermore, semi-quantitative real-time RT-PCR analyses between S+ and S- were applied to confirm the differential expression results for DoH obtained by cDNA-AFLP. Two biological replicates were tested. These semi-quantitative analyses were performed not only on tissues collected one hour before C. musae inoculation but also on crown tissues collected 13 days after inoculation. The real-time RT-PCR confirmed that DoH was upregulated in the S tissues collected at harvest, just before C. musae inoculation. This gene was also highly upregulated in the S- tissues collected 13 days after crown inoculation. Similar results were obtained for both biological replicates. Our results suggest that catecholamine's could play a role in banana defense mechanisms to crown rot disease.",2011,Communications in agricultural and applied biological sciences
Uncertainty Quantification for Kernel Methods,"We propose a data-driven approach to quantify the uncertainty of models constructed by kernel methods. Our approach minimizes the needed distributional assumptions, hence, instead of working with, for example, Gaussian processes or exponential families, it only requires knowledge about some mild regularity of the measurement noise, such as it is being symmetric or exchangeable. We show, by building on recent results from finite-sample system identification, that by perturbing the residuals in the gradient of the objective function, information can be extracted about the amount of uncertainty our model has. Particularly, we provide an algorithm to build exact, non-asymptotically guaranteed, distribution-free confidence regions for ideal, noise-free representations of the function we try to estimate. For the typical convex quadratic problems and symmetric noises, the regions are star convex centered around a given nominal estimate, and have efficient ellipsoidal outer approximations. Finally, we illustrate the ideas on typical kernel methods, such as LS-SVC, KRR, kernelized LASSO and $\varepsilon$-SVR.",2018,ArXiv

The proletariat as the powerless one was oppressed by bourgeois, they become object of exploitation. This raises their class consciousness. And lead to the emergence of the class struggle among them. Lastly, proletariat must unite in order to destroy their real enemy, capitalism, which was brought by the bourgeoisie. They have to abolish private property in order to establish classless society.

Accreditation Models in Higher Education Experiences and Perspectives,"The views expressed in this Workshop Report are those of the authors. Foreword In November 2003, ENQA organised in cooperation with its Italian member agency, Comitato per la Valutazione del Sistema Universitario, a workshop on Accreditation Models in Higher Education â€“ Experiences and Perspectives in Rome, Italy. The intention of the workshop was to understand the principles of the various accreditation methodologies and models in higher education, to demonstrate examples of possible good practices on the basis of country case studies, to discuss and evaluate the usefulness of accreditation activities, their strengths and weaknesses, and to make recommendations for the future. Accreditation is a complex concept and wide-ranging as a practice, without one single denotation. In fact, national adaptations and practices vary considerably. Exactly for this reason, the workshop proved to be a successful forum for learning from each other in terms of good accreditation practices and experiences. In addition, the dialogue on the nature, purpose and objectives of accreditation, and an examination of the weak and strong points contributed to a greater understanding of accreditation in a European context. Moreover, the workshop considered the differences between accreditation and evaluation, finding that both of these modes of operation aiming to assure quality in higher education contain a developmental aspect in them. The Rome workshop contributions have been collected to this workshop report. Unfortunately, because of limited space, the individual contributions by the workshop guest speakers have had to been shortened. However, the full version of each of the workshop presentations, including the PowerPoint presentations that are not included here, can be found on the ENQA website (http://www.enqa.net/ workshop_rome.lasso). The report is structured so that it begins with three general articles on accredita-tion. This is followed by seven country cases and finally, a conclusion on the contribution of the workshop. It is my hope that this report will be of use to many, enhancing further the benefits of the workshop by continuing the sharing of ideas and fruitful discussion on accreditation, its methodologies and practices. Through the publication of this report ENQA wishes to emphasise its support for accreditation as an important method of the overall concept of quality assurance.",2004,
VII.â€”On an early Sixteenth Century MS. of English Music in the Library of Eton College,"The MS. exhibited this evening by the Provost and Fellows of Eton College belongs to a class of which very few now exist in this country. It consists of a collection of motets and magnificats for several voices, the music of each part being so written upon opposite pages that when the book is open the different parts can be sung by all the singers at the same time. This was the earliest method of writing part-music. It is found in the great collection of church music formerly preserved at Trent, a collection which contains numerous specimens of the English composers of the fifteenth century; it is also found in the Modena MS. (the chief source of our knowledge of John Dunstable) at Bologna, and, indeed, in all early MSS. of mensurable music. The system was even followed by the printers of the great editions of Orlando di Lasso and of Palestrina, the arrangement of the various parts being precisely the same as in those of the MS. now before us. Subsequently superseded by the use of part-books, from which each singer could sing his own part, it was not until the seventeenth century that full scores appeared; before then they are practically non-existent, even in MS. Though we know from the evidence of the Bologna, Trent, and Modena MSS., that the early school of composition of which Dunstable was the founder must have rapidly arrived at a high degree of elaboration, if not of perfection, the traces of it now to be found in this country are extremely slight. It is this fact which makes the Eton MS. so valuable, for the compositions it contains are without exception by Englishmen, several of whom, as I shall presently hope to show, were men of high reputation in their day. So rare have collections of this sort become, that I believe I am right in saying that there are now in England only two other MSS. of the kind which, for size and importance of their contents, can at all compare with the Eton volume. These are respectively preserved in the Libraries of Lambeth Palace and of Caius College, Cambridge, both dating from a little later than the Eton book.",1898,
Unsupervised deep learning with variational autoencoders applied to breast tumor genome-wide DNA methylation data with biologic feature extraction,"Recent advances in deep learning, particularly unsupervised approaches, have shown promise for furthering our biological knowledge through their application to gene expression datasets, though applications to epigenomic data are lacking. Here, we employ an unsupervised deep learning framework with variational autoencoders (VAEs) to learn latent representations of the DNA methylation landscape from three independent breast tumor datasets. Through interrogation of methylation-based learned latent dimension activation values, we demonstrate the feasibility of VAEs to track representative differential methylation patterns among clinical subtypes of tumors. CpGs whose methylation was most correlated VAE latent dimension activation values were significantly enriched for CpG sparse regulatory regions of the genome including enhancer regions. In addition, through comparison with LASSO, we show the utility of the VAE approach for revealing novel information about CpG DNA methylation patterns in breast cancer.",2018,bioRxiv
Speeding up feature selection: A deep-inspired network pruning algorithm,"To address the high-dimensionality of big data, numerous iterative algorithms have been introduced including least absolute shrinkage selection operator (Lasso) and iteratively sure independent screening (ISIS). However, the iterative nature of these algorithms renders the computational cost of retraining the learning model impractical. We take advantage of this key observation to propose a novel non-iterative algorithm inspired by deep neural network input reconstruction. Our proposed technique provides faster feature selection by training the model once. This is achieved by exploiting the cross entropy error between the input and the estimates. Simulation studies support our approach on several real world datasets. For rigor, a comparative analysis of the computational complexity is also provided to assert the advantage of our approach.",2016,2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)
Quantification par dÃ©formation,Les objectifs de ce papier sont une presentation elementaire de la quantification par deformation et l'expose de la preuve selon Neroslavsky et Vlassov de l'existence de star-produits sur les varietes symplectiques. Leur methode - bien que basee sur l'hypothese considerable de la nullite du troisieme espace de la cohomologie de de Rham - est representative des difficultes rencontrees et des techniques utilisees dans le travail de De Wilde relatif aux deformations de l'algebre des fonctions d'une variete symplectique (voir [3]). Le present article contient essentiellement le texte d'une conference faite en 1999 au Centre Universitaire de Luxembourg devant un public non specialise.,2002,

Variable selection for partially linear models via adaptive group lasso,"This paper study the aglasso(adaptive group lasso)for simultaneous parameter estimation and variable selection to a partially linear model.The selection of group variable for partially linear model is translated into seclection of group factor.The theoretical results show that the new method is able to identify the true model consistently,and the resulting estimator has the oracle property.The finite sample performance of the proposed procedures is illustrated by simulation studies.",2015,Journal of Northwest Normal University
"Epiphytic Communities on Marine Plants of Seychelles, Indian Ocean, East Africa","Epiphytic communities on marine plants of Seychelles (Indian Ocean Island group associated with East Africa) were investigated in January - March of 1989 during the biological voyage of the research vessel cademic Alexander Nesmeyanov. A seagrass species, Thalassodendron ciliatum, and macroalgae (Sargassum spp. and Halimeda spp.) were tested for host substrates and biomass of their dominant epiphytes were assessed. Also, in order to understand the effect of shading and nutrient filtering by epiphytes, two series of photosynthetic rates were compared for Th. ciliatum host leaves having 10% and no epiphytes. Total of 84 species of algae and main taxons of benthic animals were identified from three different host plants. An average biomass of the epiphytes on Th. cihiatum was and dominant species were green alga Halimeda opuntia, red algae Dictyurus occidentalis and Gelidiella myrioclada. These dominant species and their biomass were remarkably varied with depth increment. On Sargassum spp., an average biomass of the epiphytes was and the maximum biomass was never exceeded . In the case of Halimeda spp. an average biomass of the epiphytes was , and dominant species were Peyssonnelia dubyi, sponges and decapods. Photosynthetic rates of Th. ciliatum were significantly reduced in the leaves having 10% epiphytes (1.72 times lower, t=6.718, p",2000,Ocean and Polar Research
Nonconvex penalized regression using depth-based penalty functions: multitask learning and support union recovery in high dimensions,"We propose a new class of nonconvex penalty functions in the paradigm of penalized sparse regression that are based on data depth-based inverse ranking. Focusing on a one-step sparse estimator of the coefficient matrix that is based on local linear approximation of the penalty function, we derive its theoretical properties and provide the algorithm for its computation. For orthogonal design and independent responses, the resulting thresholding rule enjoys near-minimax optimal risk performance, similar to the adaptive lasso (Zou, 2006). A simulation study as well as real data analysis demonstrate its effectiveness compared to present methods that provide sparse solutions in multivariate regression.",2016,
A Brief Introduction to the Temporal Group LASSO and its Potential Applications in Healthcare,"The Temporal Group LASSO is an example of a multi-task, regularized regression approach for the prediction of response variables that vary over time. The aim of this work is to introduce the reader to the concepts behind the Temporal Group LASSO and its related methods, as well as to the type of potential applications in a healthcare setting that the method has. We argue that the method is attractive because of its ability to reduce overfitting, select predictors, learn smooth effect patterns over time, and finally, its simplicity",2017,arXiv: Machine Learning
The Pyrenees,"AbstractIN this volume Dr. E. Trutat gives a sketch, as the full title states, of the mountains, glaciers, mineral springs, atmospheric phenomena, flora, fauna, and man in the Pyrenees, illustrated by woodcuts and diagrams, together with two small maps. The mountains differ from the Alps in their greater simplicity of structure, for they form â€œthe most perfect type of a regular chain.â€ Like the Alps, this consists of an axis of crystalline rocks, granites, gneisses, and schists, flanked on both sides by deposits comparatively unaltered. But there is one important difference: in the Alps, systems anterior to the Carboniferous are only recognised in the extreme east; in the larger part of the chain, rocks of that or of a later age rest on crystalline schists, which must be very ancient. But in the Pyrenees schists truly crystalline are succeeded by great stratified masses which have been much less markedly changed. The most ancient of these are assigned to the Cambrian, though as yet fossils either have not been found, or are too ill-preserved to afford any certain evidences of age. It seems, however, clear that they are older than the Silurian system, for the different members of this can be identified in several places by their characteristic fossils. The Devonian system is well developed, and followed by limestones (marine), conglomerates, and slaty rocks of the Carboniferous period. The occurrence of Permian rocks is considered by Dr. Trutat to be doubtful. Trias, of the Lorraine type, is found, followed by representatives of the various systems in orderly succession up to the Neocomian. Between this and the Cretaceous is a break, then the sequence continues till after the Nummulitic age. Then, as in the Alps, began the great series of movement, of what the present chain is the outcome. Masses of eruptive rock are connected with these disturbances. The enormous beds of conglomerate, called the Poudingues de Palassou, which sometimes surpass 1000 metres in thickness, recall the Alpine nagelfluhe. Strata partly marine, partly freshwater, represent the Miocene and the Pliocene; the Quaternary deposits presenting a general resemblance to those of the Alps.Les PyrÃ©nÃ©es.
