Inference of the kinetic Ising model with heterogeneous missing data.,"We consider the problem of inferring a causality structure from multiple binary time series by using the kinetic Ising model in datasets where a fraction of observations is missing. Inspired by recent work on mean field methods for the inference of the model with hidden spins, we develop a pseudo-expectation-maximization algorithm that is able to work even in conditions of severe data sparsity. The methodology relies on the Martin-Siggia-Rose path integral method with second-order saddle-point solution to make it possible to approximate the log-likelihood in polynomial time, giving as output an estimate of the couplings matrix and of the missing observations. We also propose a recursive version of the algorithm, where at every iteration some missing values are substituted by their maximum-likelihood estimate, showing that the method can be used together with sparsification schemes such as lasso regularization or decimation. We test the performance of the algorithm on synthetic data and find interesting properties regarding the dependency on heterogeneity of the observation frequency of spins and when some of the hypotheses that are necessary to the saddle-point approximation are violated, such as the small couplings limit and the assumption of statistical independence between couplings.",2019,Physical review.

"Palynology of the plant-bearing rhaetian to hettangian kap stewart formation, scoresby sund, east greenland","Abstract The Kap Stewart Formation of Scoresby Sund, known for a well-preserved and extensive flora of macroplant fossils (Harris, 1926â€“1937), has been palynologically investigated to compare the microflora and the macroflora from the same localities and to obtain a palynological dating. The localities and the geology along Hurry Inlet are described; here the formation is limnic and with dominance of arkosic sandstone intercalated with sandy shale beds. These localities have yielded the Scoresby Sund Flora with a lower Lepidopteris Zone and an upper Thaumatopteris Zone (Harris, 1937), with few species in common. The macroflora, dominated by cycadophytes, ginkgophytes, conifers, pteridosperms and ferns, shows strong agreement with NW European floras of the same age. In the microflora the form types representing the gymnospermous plant groups are normally dominant, but in some samples spores of ferns are abundant. In the systematic section about eighty species are treated. This microflora is divided into two microflora zones with subdivisions. Zone 1 characterized by frequent Ricciisporites tuberculatus Lundblad and presence of Rhaetipollis germanicus E. Schulz, Limbosporites lundbladii Nilsson, Apiculatisporis parvispinosus (Leschik) E. Schulz and Ovalipollis ovalis Krutzsch. Zone 2 above differs by the absence of the species mentioned and the incoming of Cerebropollenites thiegartii E. Schulz, Heliosporites altmarkensis E. Schulz and Trachysporites fuscus Nilsson. However, many species occur in both zones. The microflora Zone 1 comprises the Lepidopteris Zone and the Transition Region of the macroflora, and Zone 2 is equivalent to the Thaumatopteris Zone. Zone 1 is correlated with the Rhaetipollis-Limbosporites Zone known from the lower part of the Rhaetian (Middle Rhaetic sensu germanico ) in NW Europe and Zone 2 with the Pinuspollenites-Trachysporites Zone of Hettangian age. Furthermore the zones are correlated with areas in Europe, Arctic Canada and Svalbard. Differences in the microflora of Scoresby Sund and NW Europe, such as low frequency of Corollina ( Classopollis ) in Scoresby Sund, are probably due to more northerly latitude of the area.",1980,Review of Palaeobotany and Palynology
Transurethral bladder neck incision in women with primary bladder neck obstruction,"SummaryBackgroundBladder outlet obstruction is an uncommon condition in women. Primary bladder neck obstruction is one of the functional causes of bladder outlet obstruction. We evaluated surgical treatment in our patients with primary bladder neck obstruction.Patients and methodsWe retrospectively evaluated the medical data of 47 female patients from the Department of Urology who underwent transurethral incision of the bladder neck from January 2000 to December 2012. All patients underwent transurethral bladder neck incision at the vesical neck and proximal urethra at the 5- and 7-oâ€™clock positions. We compared symptoms and urodynamic parameters before and after the operation.ResultsOut of 47 female patients who underwent the operation, primary bladder neck obstruction was diagnosed in 42. The mean age was 44.3â€‰Â±â€‰16.8 (range: 21â€“78) years. The postoperative maximal flow rates were significantly increased (20.6â€‰Â±â€‰3.9 vs. 7.6â€‰Â±â€‰3.2Â mL/s, Pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001), and the postvoid residual urine was decreased (31.3â€‰Â±â€‰7.8 vs. 132.1â€‰Â±â€‰22.24Â mL, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.0002) compared with preoperative findings. Improvement was evident in most patients (83.3â€‰%). A repeat operation had to be performed in seven patients (16.7â€‰%). Operative therapy failed in one patient (2.4â€‰%).Discussion and conclusionsThe diagnosis of primary bladder neck obstruction in women is based on typical symptoms, uroflowmetry and multichannel urodynamics, including electromyography. Videourodynamics is obligatory in doubtful cases. Transurethral bladder neck incision is an effective therapy for female patients with primary bladder neck obstruction, and if necessary, a second procedure can be safely performed.ZusammenfassungHintergrundBlasenauslassobstruktion ist eine seltene Erkrankung bei Frauen. PrimÃ¤re Blasenhalsobstruktion ist eine der funktionellen Ursachen der Blasenauslassobstruktion. Wir werteten die Ergebnisse der chirurgischen Behandlung bei unseren Patientinnen mit einer primÃ¤ren Blasenhalsobstruktion aus.Patienten und MethodenWir untersuchten retrospektiv die Daten von 47 Patientinnen aus unserer Klinik fÃ¼r Urologie, die sich einer transurethralen Inzision des Blasenhalses vom Januar 2000 bis Dezember 2012 unterzogen. Bei allen Patientinnen wurde die transurethrale Inzision des Blasenhalses und des prohimalen HarnrÃ¶hrenanteils bei 5 und 7 Uhr durchgefÃ¼hrt. Wir verglichen Symptome und urodynamische Parameter vor und nach der Operation.ErgebnisseVon den insgesamt 47 operierten, weiblichen Patienten wurde eine primÃ¤re Blasenhalsobstruktion bei 42 Frauen diagnostiziert. Das mittlere Alter betrug 44,3â€‰Â±â€‰16,8 Jahre (Bereich von 21â€“78 Jahre). Die postoperativen maximalen Flussraten (20,6â€‰Â±â€‰3,9 vs. 7,6â€‰Â±â€‰3,2Â mL/s Pâ€‰<â€‰0,0001) und die Restharnwerte (31,3â€‰Â±â€‰7,8 vs. 132,1â€‰Â±â€‰22.24Â mL Pâ€‰=â€‰0,0002) wurden im Vergleich mit den prÃ¤operativen Werten wesentlich besser. Eine Besserung dieser Werte war bei den meisten Patientinnen (83,3â€‰%) nachweisbar. Der Eingriff musste bei 7 Patientinnen (16,7â€‰%) wiederholt werden. Die operative Behandlung blieb bei einer Patientin (2,4â€‰%) erfoglos.Diskussion und SchlussfolgerungenDie Diagnose einer primÃ¤ren Blasenhalsobstruktion bei Frauen basiert auf der typischen Symptomatologie, Uroflowmetrie und Mehrkanal-Urodynamik, einschlieÃŸlich Elektromyographie. Videourodynamik bleibt obligatorisch in zweifelhaften FÃ¤llen. Transurethrale Blasenhals-Inzision stellt eine wirksame Therapieoption fÃ¼r Patientinnen mit einer primÃ¤ren Blasenhalsobstruktion dar und kann, wenn nÃ¶tig, auch ohne weiteres wiederholt werden.",2014,Wiener klinische Wochenschrift

Newton-Like Methods for Sparse Inverse Covariance Estimation,"We propose two classes of second-order optimization methods for solving the sparse inverse covariance estimation problem. The first approach, which we call the Newton-LASSO method, minimizes a piecewise quadratic model of the objective function at every iteration to generate a step. We employ the fast iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm (FISTA) to solve this subproblem. The second approach, which we call the Orthant-Based Newton method, is a two-phase algorithm that first identifies an orthant face and then minimizes a smooth quadratic approximation of the objective function using the conjugate gradient method. These methods exploit the structure of the Hessian to efficiently compute the search direction and to avoid explicitly storing the Hessian. We also propose a limited memory BFGS variant of the orthant-based Newton method. Numerical results, including comparisons with the method implemented in the QUIC software [1], suggest that all the techniques described in this paper constitute useful tools for the solution of the sparse inverse covariance estimation problem.",2012,
Stratification of TAD boundaries reveals preferential insulation of super-enhancers by strong boundaries,"The metazoan genome is compartmentalized in areas of highly interacting chromatin known as topologically associating domains (TADs). TADs are demarcated by boundaries mostly conserved across cell types and even across species. However, a genome-wide characterization of TAD boundary strength in mammals is still lacking. In this study, we first use fused two-dimensional lasso as a machine learning method to improve Hi-C contact matrix reproducibility, and, subsequently, we categorize TAD boundaries based on their insulation score. We demonstrate that higher TAD boundary insulation scores are associated with elevated CTCF levels and that they may differ across cell types. Intriguingly, we observe that super-enhancers are preferentially insulated by strong boundaries. Furthermore, we demonstrate that strong TAD boundaries and super-enhancer elements are frequently co-duplicated in cancer patients. Taken together, our findings suggest that super-enhancers insulated by strong TAD boundaries may be exploited, as a functional unit, by cancer cells to promote oncogenesis.Topologically associating domains (TADs) detected by Hi-C technologies are megabase-scale areas of highly interacting chromatin. Here Gong, Lazaris et al. develop a computational approach to improve the reproducibility of Hi-C contact matrices and stratify TAD boundaries based on their insulating strength.",2018,Nature Communications

Abundance of benthic copepods in a saline lake in East Antarctica,"Antarctic lake ecosystems have an abundance of primary producers, including benthic algae and mosses. Despite this, many of the lakes, particularly those in East Antarctica, are deporporate of fauna. This may be due, in part, to the relatively young age of many lakes in the region. The majority of Antarctic lakes were created by glacial activity following the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), which may not have allowed suYcient time for animal groups to invade and colonize these lakes from other Antarctic ecosystems. Few studies have reported the occurrence of crustaceans in East Antarctic lakes (Burton and Hamond 1981; Bayly and Eslake 1989; summarized by Gibson and Bayly 2007). Given the lack of research, the distribution, abundance, and ecology of such organisms within Antarctica remains unclear. The 38th Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition (JARE) reported Wnding copepods in the sediments of Lake Nurume Ike, a thalassohaline meromictic lake on the SÃ´ya Coast in the Langhovde region of East Antarctica (Fig. 1) (Seto 2001). Subsequently, several attempts were made to collect copepods from the lake using a conventional zooplankton net, hauled both vertically and horizontally. These eVorts failed to capture copepods or any other metazoan plankton. On the contrary, microscopic analysis of the copepods collected from the sediment samples suggested that they were morphologically similar to Harpacticoida, a â€˜benthic copepodaâ€™ (Dr. Kikuchi, personal communication). A conventional net haul is unlikely to capture such benthic organisms. Therefore, during the summer period of the 49th JARE we used a modiWed â€˜NIPR-1â€™ propeller net (Fukuchi et al. 1979) to quantitatively sample for organisms living in the water-sediment interface in Lake Nurume Ike. The modiWed NIPR-1 net (Fig. 2) has a submersible propeller that creates an entraining current of ca. 7 cm/s at the mouth of the plankton net (NXX-13, 100 m mesh). The propeller is powered by a DC-15V lithium ion rechargeable battery (8000WP-L, Daiwa). The NIPR-1 net was mounted on a sledge to facilitate direct contact with the lake bed. The mouth of the net was attached to a PVC tube containing the propeller. The tube was in turn connected to a stainless steel Wtting that narrowed to a rectangular mouth (Fig. 2) designed to improve suction eYciency at the watersediment interface. The height of the rectangular opening was adjusted to 3 cm above the sledge base. Lake Nurume Ike is a typical marine relic and meromictic lake (Sano et al. 1977). We measured the vertical proWle using a multi-water quality meter (YSI-6600, YSI) at the deepest point of the lake during the previous summer (2007) (Fig. 3). The water column consists of 3â€“4 layers. The surface layer (0â€“3 m, epilimnion) is slightly saline and is inXuenced by melt ice and water input from the surrounding catchment (Fig. 3). In contrast, the salinity of the second and third layers (3â€“11 m, metalimnion) is similar to the ocean. The epiand metalimnion are mixed vertically in autumn by wind-induced turbulence, thermal convection, and ice-forming processes (brine rejection and sinking). During summer oxidative conditions persist despite the development of thermal and salinity stratiWcation. The bottom layer (>11 m, hypolimnion) is completely anoxic. S. Kudoh (&) Â· K. T.

Modelo de flujo de diferencia finita de ejes simÃ©tricos para simular caÃ­das de presiÃ³n dentro y alrededor de un pozo fluyendo,"El presente estudio desarrollo un modelo de diferencias finitas de ejes simetricos, para simular caidas de presion en tres dimensiones dentro y alrededor de un pozo fluyendo. Las propiedades del pozo que se pueden simular incluyen: el almacenamiento en el revestimiento del pozo; perdidas en cabeza hidraulica a traves de la malla del pozo y la variacion de la cabeza hidraulica por medio de la longitud interior del pozo, debido a la friccion del flujo en la tuberia y a la velocidad no uniforme. El modelo admite penetracion parcial del pozo y multiples intervalos monitoreados. La fraccion del flujo interno total hacia el pozo que es aportado por cada capa acuifera, es una variable que se calcula en cada paso de tiempo. Las propiedades del acuifero que pueden ser simuladas incluyen condiciones confinadas (con o sin filtracion), condiciones no confinadas, no isotropia horizontal- vertical y variaciones verticales en la conductividad hidraulica. El flujo horizontal es calculado de una integracion de la ley de Darcy que permite la variacion del area de la seccion trasversal de una celda de diferencia finita a la siguiente. La capa mas alta de celdas de diferencias finitas, la cual representa la parte mas alta de la zona saturada, contribuye con una produccion o rendimiento especifico aparente de agua almacenada, mientras que otras celdas contribuyen un almacenamiento especifico de agua almacenada. Esta representacion permite la simulacion del efecto de â€œrendimiento o produccion retrasadaâ€. El calculo del flujo horizontal en la capa mas alta de celdas admite la reduccion del area de la seccion transversal (y de la transmisibilidad) causada por la disminucion del nivel de agua freatica. El modelo requiere uniformidad horizontal de la conductividad hidraulica, rendimiento especifico y almacenamiento especifico. Asi mismo, exige que la capa superior de las celdas deba ser mas gruesa verticalmente que la maxima caida de presion del nivel de agua freatica, y que el frente de filtracion, no sea simulado. La configuracion geometrica implica que la entrada de la bomba, este encima del tope de la malla del pozo. Tambien es necesario un limite de paso de tiempo bajo, ya que pasos de tiempo grandes hacen que el metodo explicito resulte en tiempo de ejecucion muy largo o que no converja. Varias propiedades diferentes del acuifero y numerosas complejidades en el sistema de flujo que son causadas por las caracteristicas del pozo, pueden ser simuladas. Todas las caracteristicas pueden ser simuladas simultaneamente.Â  El mode lo fue probado mediante la comparacion de sus resultados con los resultados de lassoluciones analiticas publicadas y otros modelos matematicos. Los resultados estuvieron generalmente en un buen grado de concordancia.",2008,
Exploiting Concept Correlation with Attributes for Semantic Binary Representation Learning,"Recent years have witnessed the unprecedented efforts of visual representation for enabling various efficient and effective multimedia applications. In this paper, we propose a novel visual representation framework, which generates efficient semantic hash codes for visual samples by substantially exploring concepts, semantic attributes as well as their inter-correlations. Specifically, we construct a conceptual space, where the semantic knowledge of concepts and attributes is embedded. Then, we develop an effective on-line feature coding scheme for visual objects by leveraging the inter-concept relationships through the intermediate representative power of attributes. The code process is formulated as an overlapping group lasso problem, which can be efficiently solved. Finally, we binarize the visual representation to generate efficient hash codes. Extensive experiments have illustrated the superiority of our proposed framework on visual retrieval task as compared to state-of-the-art methods.",2017,
Statistical methods for the testing and estimation of linear dependence structures on paired high-dimensional data : application to genomic data,"This thesis provides novel methodology for statistical analysis of paired high-dimensional genomic data, with the aim to identify gene interactions specific to each group of samples as well as the gene connections that change between the two classes of observations. An example of such groups can be patients under two medical conditions, in which the estimation of gene interaction networks is relevant to biologists as part of discerning gene regulatory mechanisms that control a disease process like, for instance, cancer. We construct these interaction networks from data by considering the nonzero structure of correlation matrices, which measure linear dependence between random variables, and their inverse matrices, which are commonly known as precision matrices and determine linear conditional dependence instead. In this regard, we study three statistical problems related to the testing, single estimation and joint estimation of (conditional) dependence structures. Firstly, we develop hypothesis testing methods to assess the equality of two correlation matrices, and also two correlation sub-matrices, corresponding to two classes of samples, and hence the equality of the underlying gene interaction networks. We consider statistics based on the average of squares, maximum and sum of exceedances of sample correlations, which are suitable for both independent and paired observations. We derive the limiting distributions for the test statistics where possible and, for practical needs, we present a permuted samples based approach to find their corresponding non-parametric distributions. Cases where such hypothesis testing presents enough evidence against the null hypothesis of equality of two correlation matrices give rise to the problem of estimating two correlation (or precision) matrices. However, before that we address the statistical problem of estimating conditional dependence between random variables in a single class of samples when data are high-dimensional, which is the second topic of the thesis. We study the graphical lasso method which employs an L1 penalized likelihood expression to estimate the precision matrix and its underlying non-zero graph structure. The lasso penalization term is given by the L1 norm of the precision matrix elements scaled by a regularization parameter, which determines the trade-off between sparsity of the graph and fit to the data, and its selection is our main focus of investigation. We propose several procedures to select the regularization parameter in the graphical lasso optimization problem that rely on network characteristics such as clustering or connectivity of the graph. Thirdly, we address the more general problem of estimating two precision matrices that are 5 expected to be similar, when datasets are dependent, focusing on the particular case of paired observations. We propose a new method to estimate these precision matrices simultaneously, a weighted fused graphical lasso estimator. The analogous joint estimation method concerning two regression coefficient matrices, which we call weighted fused regression lasso, is also developed in this thesis under the same paired and high-dimensional setting. The two joint estimators maximize penalized marginal log likelihood functions, which encourage both sparsity and similarity in the estimated matrices, and that are solved using an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. Sparsity and similarity of the matrices are determined by two tuning parameters and we propose to choose them by controlling the corresponding average error rates related to the expected number of false positive edges in the estimated conditional dependence networks. These testing and estimation methods are implemented within the R package ldstatsHD, and are applied to a comprehensive range of simulated data sets as well as to high-dimensional real case studies of genomic data. We employ testing approaches with the purpose of discovering pathway lists of genes that present significantly different correlation matrices on healthy and unhealthy (e.g., tumor) samples. Besides, we use hypothesis testing problems on correlation sub-matrices to reduce the number of genes for estimation. The proposed joint estimation methods are then considered to find gene interactions that are common between medical conditions as well as interactions that vary in the presence of unhealthy tissues.",2018,
Caribbean Marine Protected Areas : PRACTICAL APPROACHES TO ACHIEVE ECONOMIC AND CONSERVATION GOALS,"Population density can affect rates of mortality and individual growth. We measured these for the nonexploited bluehead wrasse, Thalassoma bifasciatum, at three sites around St. Croix, US Virgin Islands. Previous work demonstrated that differences in the degree of larval retention in these sites results in very large differences in recruitment intensity. Post-settlement mortality differed among sites and was positively related to recruitment density. Post-settlement growth differences were small. Because of strong mortality effects early in life, adult densities and size/age distributions differed among sites and did not reflect differences in recruitment rate. The site with the highest retention and recruitment (Butler Bay) had many small fish, while the two other sites with lower recruitment rates (Jacks Bay and Green Cay) had proportionally more large fish. These differences resulted in large differences in egg production. Per capita production was highest at the lowest density site (Green Cay). Total egg production at Green Cay was 75% that at Butler Bay, despite only having half the population size, and the highest overall production was at Jacks Bay, with low retention and moderate recruitment. In terms of marine reserve location, sites predicted to have high retention and recruitment may not always be the sites of highest egg production due to density-dependent processes, and it is important to consider the relative values of self-recruitment and larval export in reserve design. types of protection not afforded by other management strategies, including intrinsic protection from overfishing (Dugan and Davis 1993, Allison et al. 1998) and potential enhancement of fisheries (Rakitin and Kramer 1996, Russ and Acala 1996, Allison et al. 1998, Chapman and Kramer 1999). As the number of marine reserves increase, so do the empirical studies comparing these sites to nearby outside areas. It has been well established at this point that both population size and individual sizes tend to be larger inside of reserves relative to nearby fished areas (reviewed in Roberts and Polunin 1991, Dugan and Davis 1993, Halpern in press). This effect of protection occurs despite the fact that virtually all marine reserves to date have been designed and located rather opportunistically (e.g., for social and political reasons) without much consideration of optimal reserve size or the biological, oceanographic, and physical characteristics of the site. However, in recent years, there has been a tremendous upsurge in public interest in reserves and many countries, including the U.S. are moving towards regional and national programs of reserve establishment. Not only is it important that we gain a better understanding of how reserves affect both the areas they are intended to protect and the various stakeholders who use marine resources, but we need to move towards a better â€œscienceâ€ of reserve design and siting.

Variable Selection with Big Data based on Zero Norm and via Sequential Monte Carlo,"Selecting a subset from many potential explanatory variables in linear regressions has long been the subject of research interest, and the matter is made more important in the era of big data when many more variables become available/accessible. Of late, the l1-norm penalty based techniques such as Lasso of Tibshirani (1996) have become very popular. However, the variable selection problem in its natural setting is a zero-norm penalty problem, i.e., a penalty on the number of variables as opposed to the l1-norm of the regression coefficients. The popularity of the l1-norm penalty or its variants has more to do with computational considerations, because selection with the zero-norm penalty is a highly demanding combinatory optimization problem when the number of potential variables becomes large. We devise a sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) method as a practical and reliable tool for zero-norm variable selection problems, and selecting, say, best 20 out of 1,000 potential variables can, for example, be completed with a typical multi-core desktop computer in a couple of minutes. The methodological essence is to understand that the selection problem is equivalent to the task of sampling from a discrete probability function defined over all possible combinations comprising, say, k regressors out of p â‰¥ k potential variables, where the peak of this function corresponds to the optimal combination. The solution technique sets out to sequentially generate samples, and after a while the final sample represents the target probability function. With the final SMC sample in place, we deploy the extreme value theory to assess how likely and to what extent the maximum R2 has been achieved. We also demonstrate through a simulation study the methodâ€™s reliability and superiority vis-a-vis the adaptive Lasso. âˆ—Duan is with the National University of Singapore (Business School, Risk Management Institute and Department of Economics).

[Diversity of oil-degrading bacteria isolated form the Indian Ocean sea surface].,"OBJECTIVE
In order to investigate the diversity of oil-degrading bacteria in the surface seawater across the India Ocean, and to obtain new oil-degrading bacteria.


METHODS
Potential oil-degrading bacteria were selected out via 1:1 mixture of diesel and crude oil as sole carbon source. Meanwhile, the community structure of 13 enrichments was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE).


RESULTS
We obtained 51 unique strains of 29 genera after screening via morphological, physiological, biochemical and 16S rRNA analyses. They mainly belonged to a and gamma-Proteobacteria. The four genera Alcanivorax (accounting for 18%), Novosphingobium (10%), Marinobacter (6%) and Thalassospira (6%) were the most predominant bacteria. Ecological analyses showed that the bacteria had high diversity with Shannon-Winner index (H) of 4.57968, and distributed even with Evenness index (E) as 0.8664771. Then Further experiments revealed oil-degrading capability of 49 strains. In addition, our investigation revealed oil-degrading ability of genera Sinomonas, Knoellia and Mesoflavibacter for the first time. DGGE fingerprint patterns indicated that the genus Alcanivorax was an important oil-degrading bacteria in the surface seawater across the India Ocean.


CONCLUSION
This study demonstrated a high diversity of the oil-degradation bacteria in the surface seawater of Indian Ocean, these bacteria are of potential in bioremediation of marine oil pollution.",2010,Wei sheng wu xue bao = Acta microbiologica Sinica

"Rocky reef fish assemblages at six Mediterranean marine protected areas: broad-scale patterns in assemblage structure, species richness and composition","Abstract Fish assemblages inhabiting shallow rocky reefs at six Italian marine protected areas (MPAs) were investigated to assess broad-scale patterns in assemblage structure, species richness and composition, and to evaluate the presence of a latitudinal gradient in the distribution pattern of a thermophilic fish, the ornate wrasse Thalassoma pavo. Fish abundance was estimated by visual censuses carried out within the integral reserve zones, within the 1--7 m depth range and during four sampling periods. Multivariate analyses revealed significant differences in the assemblage structure among MPAs, although patterns of variation changed considerably from time to time and they were not consistent with latitudinal or longitudinal gradient. Fish assemblages of Miramare (northern Adriatic) and those of the other MPAs clearly separated into two groups. Multivariate differences among MPAs mainly relied upon some relatively common species (e.g. Diplodus puntazzo and Muraena helena). Substantial contribution to these differences was also accounted for by T. pavo. Significant differences among MPAs were detected also in species richness and total density of fish, although the effect of MPA on species richness varied significantly from time to time. Both species richness and total density of fish at Miramare were always higher compared to the other MPAs, likely in relation to peculiar habitat characteristics. Density of T. pavo declined significantly from south to north, thus confirming the thermophily of this species. Present data point out the importance of monitoring marine fish diversity through long-term surveys across a wide spatial scale, in order to detect the early effects of water warming and to develop future plans of management and conservation.",2013,Italian Journal of Zoology
The hidden material culture of the Dark Ages. Early medieval ceramics at Sagalassos (Turkey): new evidence (ca AD 650-800),"On the basis of recent archaeological evidence unearthed in the course of systematic excavations by the Sagalassos Archaeological Research Project (Katholieke Universiteit Leuven) in southwestern Turkey, this paper attempts to pull together different strings of ceramic data in order to bridge the era between late antiquity and the Middle Ages (mid seventh century to ninth century AD). Our aim is to present samples of the ceramic assemblages excavated at the site of ancient Sagalassos from layers that are most probably dated to the late seventh and eighth centuries. An attempt has been made to examine rigorously the stratigraphy and its contents that are admittedly completely different to the known ceramic forms of the late Roman/early Byzantine (fourth century to mid seventh century) and middle Byzantine (early tenth century to mid 13th century) periods at Sagalassos. Five different pottery types are presented, both kitchenwares and tablewares. The fact that all the ware types presented here are local products should not be seen necessarily as a result of a general decline in trade, rural and/or urban life, but rather as a local response to a generally changing economic system and an emerging local pottery tradition based on household-organised production. The shift from the Roman mass-produced and customised wares (that started to disappear from the market) to non-specialised local/regional production (that started to satisfy basic household needs) need not have been a sudden one. Our ultimate aim is to contribute to recent attempts to throw more light on the archaeologically 'hidden' material culture of the so called 'Dark Ages'.",2009,Anatolian studies
"Applied the additive hazard model to predict the survival time of patient with diffuse large B- cell lymphoma and determine the effective genes, using microarray data","Background: Recent studies have shown that effective genes on survival time of cancer patients play an important role as a risk factor or preventive factor. Present study was designed to determine effective genes on survival time for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients and predict the survival time using these selected genes. Materials & Methods: Present study is a cohort study was conducted on 40 patients with diffuse large Bcell lymphoma. For these patients, 2042 gene expression was measured. In order to predict the survival time, the composition of the semi-parametric additive survival model with two gene selection methods elastic net and lasso were used. Two methods were evaluated by plotting area under the ROC curve over time and calculating the integral of this curve. Results: Based on our findings, the elastic net method identified 10 genes, and Lasso-Cox method identified 7 genes. GENE3325X increased the survival time (P=0.006), Whereas GENE3980X and GENE377X reduced the survival time (P=0.004). These three genes were selected as important genes in both methods. Conclusion: This study showed that the elastic net method outperformed the common Lasso method in terms of predictive power. Moreover, apply the additive model instead Cox regression and using microarray data is usable way for predict the survival time of patients.",2015,
"Joint analysis of additive, dominant and first-order epistatic effects of four genes (IGF2, MC4R, PRKAG3 and LEPR) with known effects on fat content and fat distribution in pigs.","LEPR, MC4R, IGF2 and PRKAG3 are genes with known effects on fat content and distribution in pig carcass and pork. In a study performed with DurocÂ Ã—Â Landrace/Large White pigs, we have found that IGF2 has strong additive effects on several carcass conformational traits and on fatty acid composition in several anatomical locations. MC4R shows additive effects on saturated fatty acid content in several muscles. On the other side, almost no additive effect has been found for PRKAG3 and very few for LEPR. In this work, no dominant effect has been found for any of the four genes. Using a Bayesian Lasso approach, we have been able now to find first-order epistatic (mainly dominant-additive) effects between LEPR and PRKAG3 for intramuscular fat content and for saturated fatty acid content in L. dorsii, B. femoralis, Ps. major and whole ham. The presence of interactions between genes in the shaping of traits of such importance as intramuscular fat content and composition highlights the complexity of heritable traits and the difficulty of gene-assisted selection for such traits.",2014,Animal genetics
Steering through Successive Objects,"We investigate stroking motions through successive objects with styli. There are several promising models for stroking motions, such as crossing tasks, which require endpoint accuracy of a stroke, or steering tasks, which require continuous accuracy throughout the trajectory. However, a task requiring users to repeatedly steer through constrained path segments has never been studied, although such operations are needed in GUIs, e.g., for selecting icons or objects on illustration software through lassoing. We empirically confirmed that the interval, trajectory width, and obstacle size significantly affect the movement speed. Existing models can not accurately predict user performance in such tasks. We found several unexpected results such as that steering through denser objects sometimes required less times than expected. Speed profile analysis showed the reasons behind such behaviors, such as participants' anticipation strategies. We also discuss the applicability of exiting performance models and revisions.",2018,

[Multi-mathematical modelings for compatibility optimization of Jiangzhi granules].,"OBJECTIVE
To investigate into the method of ""multi activity index evaluation and combination optimized of mult-component"" for Chinese herbal formulas.


METHOD
According to the scheme of uniform experimental design, efficacy experiment, multi index evaluation, least absolute shrinkage, selection operator (LASSO) modeling, evolutionary optimization algorithm, validation experiment, we optimized the combination of Jiangzhi granules based on the activity indexes of blood serum ALT, ALT, AST, TG, TC, HDL, LDL and TG level of liver tissues, ratio of liver tissue to body.


RESULT
Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) combining with criteria importance through intercriteria correlation (CRITIC) for multi activity index evaluation was more reasonable and objective, it reflected the information of activity index's order and objective sample data. LASSO algorithm modeling could accurately reflect the relationship between different combination of Jiangzhi granule and the activity comprehensive indexes. The optimized combination of Jiangzhi granule showed better values of the activity comprehensive indexed than the original formula after the validation experiment.


CONCLUSION
AHP combining with CRITIC can be used for multi activity index evaluation and LASSO algorithm, it is suitable for combination optimized of Chinese herbal formulas.",2011,Zhongguo Zhong yao za zhi = Zhongguo zhongyao zazhi = China journal of Chinese materia medica
Segmental ostial ablation to isolate the pulmonary veins during atrial fibrillation: feasibility and mechanistic insights.,"BACKGROUND
The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility and mechanistic implications of segmental pulmonary vein (PV) ostial ablation during atrial fibrillation (AF).


METHODS AND RESULTS
Forty consecutive patients underwent PV isolation for AF. Among 125 PVs targeted for isolation, ablation was performed during AF in 70 veins and during sinus rhythm in 55 veins. A decapolar Lasso catheter was positioned near the ostium. During AF, ostial ablation was performed near the Lasso catheter electrodes that recorded a tachycardia with a cycle length shorter than in the adjacent left atrium. During sinus rhythm, ostial ablation was guided by PV potentials. Complete PV isolation was achieved in 70 PVs (100%) ablated during AF and in 53 PVs (96%) ablated during sinus rhythm (P=0.4). The mean durations of radiofrequency energy needed for isolation were 7.4+/-4.4 and 5.2+/-3.9 minutes during AF and sinus rhythm, respectively (P<0.01). Before ablation, an immediate recurrence of AF (IRAF), occurred after cardioversion in 18 of 40 patients, and IRAF was consistently abolished by PV isolation. The probability of AF termination during isolation of a PV was directly related to the extent of tachycardia in that vein. As more PVs were isolated, induction of persistent AF by rapid pacing became less likely.


CONCLUSIONS
Segmental ostial ablation guided by PV tachycardia during AF is feasible and as efficacious as during sinus rhythm. The responses to cardioversion, ablation, and rapid pacing observed in this study imply that IRAF is triggered by the PVs and that PV tachycardias may play an important role in the perpetuation of AF.",2002,Circulation
Fast Newton methods for the group fused lasso,"We present a new algorithmic approach to the group fused lasso, a convex model that approximates a multi-dimensional signal via an approximately piecewise-constant signal. This model has found many applications in multiple change point detection, signal compression, and total variation denoising, though existing algorithms typically using first-order or alternating minimization schemes. In this paper we instead develop a specialized projected Newton method, combined with a primal active set approach, which we show to be substantially faster that existing methods. Furthermore, we present two applications that use this algorithm as a fast subroutine for a more complex outer loop: segmenting linear regression models for time series data, and color image denoising. We show that on these problems the proposed method performs very well, solving the problems faster than state-of-the-art methods and to higher accuracy.",2014,
"Development and internal validation of an aneurysm rupture probability model based on patient characteristics and aneurysm location, morphology, and hemodynamics","PurposeUnruptured cerebral aneurysms pose a dilemma for physicians who need to weigh the risk of a devastating subarachnoid hemorrhage against the risk of surgery or endovascular treatment and their complications when deciding on a treatment strategy. A prediction model could potentially support such treatment decisions. The aim of this study was to develop and internally validate a model for aneurysm rupture based on hemodynamic and geometric parameters, aneurysm location, and patient gender and age.MethodsCross-sectional data from 1061 patients were used for image-based computational fluid dynamics and shape characterization of 1631 aneurysms for training an aneurysm rupture probability model using logistic group Lasso regression. The modelâ€™s discrimination and calibration were internally validated based on the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic and calibration plots.ResultsThe final model retained 11 hemodynamic and 12 morphological variables, aneurysm location, as well as patient age and gender. An adverse hemodynamic environment characterized by a higher maximum oscillatory shear index, higher kinetic energy and smaller low shear area as well as a more complex aneurysm shape, male gender and younger age were associated with an increased rupture risk. The corresponding AUC of the model was 0.86 (95% CI [0.85, 0.86], after correction for optimism 0.84).ConclusionThe model combining variables from various domains was able to discriminate between ruptured and unruptured aneurysms with an AUC of 86%. Internal validation indicated potential for the application of this model in clinical practice after evaluation with longitudinal data.",2018,International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery

Birds in Texas Zoos,"As of 1 January 1996, of the 25 largest U.S. zoo bird collections (by species) listed by the American Zoo and Aquarium Association 0996), five were Texan. Two of these. San Antonio and Houston, are in the top ten. Collectively, roughly 600 species and subspecies of birds are held by the nearly 20 zoos, aquariums and wildlife parks in Texas. Since at least the 1940s, the San Antonio Zoological Gardens has been one of the world's great bird collections, at times exceeding 500 species and subspecies, and, in some years, being the second largest U.S. zoo bird collection, after the San Diego Zoo. On 1 January 1996, San Antonio ranked Number Five, after the San Diego Zoo and Wild Animal Park, the Bron,'< Zoo, and Cincinnati Zoo, with 1,014 specimens representing 219 taxa. San Antonio Zoo San Antonio Zoo is uniquely endowed with an artesian well supplying numerous canals and pools at a constant warm temperature. so that tropical fishes, such as tilapia, shark catfish, and plecostornus flourish yearround. It is only to he expected that there is a wonderful collection of aquatic birds, including such oddities as Horned Screamers, Straw-necked Ibis, and a Black-necked Stork tEpbtpptorhyncbus asiaticus). African White-hacked Ducks (7halassomis /. leuconotus) are the gems among 44 taxa of ducks, geese and swans. At the beginning of 1977, the two pairs, occupying their own canal-fed enclosure, were the only ones in any American public zoo. Of course the pair of Whooping Cranes stand out among the eight crane taxa, which also include one of the few proven breeding pairs of Hooded Cranes in captivity. Most zoos today display far fewer parrot species than they used to and it is rare to find more than a dozen or so taxa on display. San Antonio, however, holds more than 40 species. While it is, of course, exciting to see such rarities as Blue-throated (or Caninde), Red-fronted, and Buffon's Macaws, breeding Golden Conures, Red-tailed Black Cockatoos, and Long-hilled Corellas, it is also very satisfying to find serious exhibits of all three species of Polytelis, Senegal Parrots (with Jackson's Hornhills in the walkthrough Rift Valley Forest Aviary), Grey-cheeked Brotogeris, White-hellied Caique, and White-crowned Parrot (Pionus sentlis).

Using data from an encounter sampler to model fish dispersal.,"A method to estimate speed of free-ranging fishes using a passive sampling device is described and illustrated with data from the Everglades, U.S.A. Catch per unit effort (CPUE) from minnow traps embedded in drift fences was treated as an encounter rate and used to estimate speed, when combined with an independent estimate of density obtained by use of throw traps that enclose 1 m(2) of marsh habitat. Underwater video was used to evaluate capture efficiency and species-specific bias of minnow traps and two sampling studies were used to estimate trap saturation and diel-movement patterns; these results were used to optimize sampling and derive correction factors to adjust species-specific encounter rates for bias and capture efficiency. Sailfin mollies Poecilia latipinna displayed a high frequency of escape from traps, whereas eastern mosquitofish Gambusia holbrooki were most likely to avoid a trap once they encountered it; dollar sunfish Lepomis marginatus were least likely to avoid the trap once they encountered it or to escape once they were captured. Length of sampling and time of day affected CPUE; fishes generally had a very low retention rate over a 24 h sample time and only the Everglades pygmy sunfish Elassoma evergladei were commonly captured at night. Dispersal speed of fishes in the Florida Everglades, U.S.A., was shown to vary seasonally and among species, ranging from 0Â· 05 to 0Â· 15 m s(-1) for small poeciliids and fundulids to 0Â· 1 to 1Â· 8 m s(-1) for L. marginatus. Speed was generally highest late in the wet season and lowest in the dry season, possibly tied to dispersal behaviours linked to finding and remaining in dry-season refuges. These speed estimates can be used to estimate the diffusive movement rate, which is commonly employed in spatial ecological models.",2011,Journal of fish biology
Day ahead electricity price forecast by NARX model with LASSO based features selection,"The availability of accurate day-ahead price forecasts is crucial to achieve an effective participation to electricity markets. Starting from available state of the art, we propose a forecast technique exploiting a nonlinear auto regressive model with exogenous input, including a feature selection mechanism based on the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO). The rationale behind such a choice is twofold. On the one hand, we aim to target potential increase of forecast accuracy by learning complex non-linear mappings. On the other hand, we want to increase the interpretability of the resulting model and minimize the effort needed to properly set up the forecaster. A framework such as the LASSO, capable to self-extract features from spot price multi-variate time series, might represent a very useful tool for industrial practitioners. Experiments have been performed on Italian market dataset, demonstrating that the proposed method can extract useful features and achieve robust performance. Moreover, we show how the proposed method can support interpretation of forecaster structure and it can reveal interesting correlations within the regression set.",2019,2019 IEEE 17th International Conference on Industrial Informatics (INDIN)
Compressed Sensing over $\ell_p$-balls: Minimax Mean Square Error,"We consider the compressed sensing problem, where the object $x_0 \in \bR^N$ is to be recovered from incomplete measurements $y = Ax_0 + z$; here the sensing matrix $A$ is an $n \times N$ random matrix with iid Gaussian entries and $n < N$. A popular method of sparsity-promoting reconstruction is $\ell^1$-penalized least-squares reconstruction (aka LASSO, Basis Pursuit). 
It is currently popular to consider the strict sparsity model, where the object $x_0$ is nonzero in only a small fraction of entries. In this paper, we instead consider the much more broadly applicable $\ell_p$-sparsity model, where $x_0$ is sparse in the sense of having $\ell_p$ norm bounded by $\xi \cdot N^{1/p}$ for some fixed $0 0$. 
We study an asymptotic regime in which $n$ and $N$ both tend to infinity with limiting ratio $n/N = \delta \in (0,1)$, both in the noisy ($z \neq 0$) and noiseless ($z=0$) cases. Under weak assumptions on $x_0$, we are able to precisely evaluate the worst-case asymptotic minimax mean-squared reconstruction error (AMSE) for $\ell^1$ penalized least-squares: min over penalization parameters, max over $\ell_p$-sparse objects $x_0$. We exhibit the asymptotically least-favorable object (hardest sparse signal to recover) and the maximin penalization. 
Our explicit formulas unexpectedly involve quantities appearing classically in statistical decision theory. Occurring in the present setting, they reflect a deeper connection between penalized $\ell^1$ minimization and scalar soft thresholding. This connection, which follows from earlier work of the authors and collaborators on the AMP iterative thresholding algorithm, is carefully explained. 
Our approach also gives precise results under weak-$\ell_p$ ball coefficient constraints, as we show here.",2011,arXiv: Information Theory

The socio-cultural challenge in public health interventions: the case of tuberculosis in India,"As per H. Graham, public health policies need to be reconï¬ -gured to improve population health and to address inequali-ties in the social distribution of health (Graham 2004). These reï¬‚ ections draw upon the fact that social determinants are central to programs and policies regarding prevention and control of diseases such as HIV/AIDS, malaria and tubercu-losis (TB). While there is ample literature demonstrating that social factors promote and/or undermine the health of women, men, families and populations, there is limited knowledge about the social processes underlying the unequal distribution of health among speciï¬ c populations, which in turn is at the root of persistent social disparities (Anderson 2000; Marmot 2000; Marmot 2005). The aim of these thoughts is to promote a better understanding, thereby a systematic account for how gender and other social processes operate in causing health inequalities in the case of TB management and control. While epidemiological evidence indicates that in low or mid-dle-income countries TB is more prevalent among men than women, studies show that this may be explained by gender differences in the social pattern of interactions (Eastwood & Hill 2004; Uplekar et al. 2001). In addition to differences in exposure and risk of infection, there is a difference in the pro-gression from infection to disease as well as in the tuberculo-sis notiï¬ cation rates in men and women (Holmes et al. 1998). Approximately three million women worldwide contract TB annually and it is estimated that TB accounts for nearly 17 million Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY) for women with about 750 000 dying of TB every year (Vlassoff et al. 2000; WHO 2002). Not only may women have higher rates of progression from infection to disease and a higher case fatality in their early reproductive ages, but consequences of the lat-ter are felt at the household and community levels (Needham et al. 2001). As a disease of poverty, the social implications of TB are heightened among women living and working in resource poor areas, such as those found in urban slum settle-ments in Mumbai. Delays in seeking help that arise from gen-der disparities to access and entitlements to care have been demonstrated to play a signiï¬ cant role in Maharashtra (Vlas-soff et al. 2000; Vissandjee et al. 2002). Research in Kerala suggests that stigma has adversely affected participation in programs such as DOTS (Directly Observed Treatment with Short course regimen), resulting in poorer treatment outcomes (Balasubramanian et al. 2004; McMurray 2007). Social dis-crimination on the basis of TB disease status may result from various factors, such as perceived danger and contagiousness, as well as adverse judgments which may attribute the condi-tion to immoral behaviour and blame the victim for acquiring the disease. Social determinants of support and rejection in-ï¬‚ uence the ways that people in the general population without TB interact with people who are symptomatic (Narayanan et al. 2003). In Western India, sex with prostitutes and menstrua-ting women were perceived to be associated with the onset of TB, leading to increased stigma and cross-gender mistrust (Holmes et al. 1998; Uplekar et al. 2001; WHO 2006). Res-ponses to TB unveil the moral basis of risk and vulnerability to this disease, suggesting a causal web of interactions lin-king ethnicity, culture and gender as social determinants of health and patterns of socialization (Narayanan et al. 2003). In this regard, ï¬ ndings of a multi-country study indicated cri-tical links between the interests of TB control, gender studies, and the socio-cultural contexts of poverty, restricted access to needed resources, and interactions between illness and victi-mization (WHO 2006) .",2007,International Journal of Public Health
Exploration of the immune-related signature and immune infiltration analysis for breast ductal and lobular carcinoma.,"Background
In this study, we aimed to explore the tumour associated immune signature of breast cancer (BC) and conduct integrative analyses with immune infiltrates in BC.


Methods
We downloaded the transcriptome profiling and clinical data of BC from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The list of immune-related signatures was from the Innate database. The limma package was utilized to conduct the normalization, and we screened the differential immune signatures in BC. A univariate Cox regression model and the LASSO method were used to find the hub prognostic immune genes. The TAIG risk model was calculated based on the multivariate Cox regression results, and a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was generated to assess the predictive power of TAIG. Moreover, we also conducted a correlation analysis between TAIG and the clinical characteristics. Additionally, we utilized the METABRIC cohort as the validation data set. The TIMER database is a comprehensive resource for performing systematic analyses of immune infiltrates across various malignancies. We evaluated the associations of immune signatures with several immune cells based on TIMER. Furthermore, we used the CIBERSORT algorithm to determine the fractions of immune cells in each sample and compared the differential distributions of immune infiltrates between two TAIG groups using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test.


Results
A total of 1,178 samples were obtained from the TCGA-BRCA database, but only 1,045 breast tumour samples were matched with complete transcriptome expression data. Meanwhile, we collected a total of 1,094 BC patients from the METABRIC cohort. We found a list of 1,399 differential immune signatures associated with survival, and functional analysis revealed that these genes participated in cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions, Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation and the JAK-STAT signalling pathway. The TAIG risk model was established from the multivariate Cox analysis, and we observed that high TAIG levels correlated with poor survival outcomes based on Kaplan-Meier analysis. The Kruskal-Wallis test suggested that high TAIG levels correlated with high AJCC-TNM stages and advanced pathological stages (P<0.01). We validated the well robustness of TAIG in METABRIC cohort and 5-year AUC reached up to 0.829. Moreover, we further uncovered the associations of hub immune signatures with immune cells and calculated the immune cell fractions in specific tumour samples based on gene signature expression. Last, we used the Wilcoxon rank-sum test to compare the differential immune density in the two groups and found that several immune cells had a significantly lower infiltrating density in the high TAIG groups, including CD8+ T cells (P=0.031), memory resting CD4+ T cells (P=0.026), M0 macrophages (P=0.023), and M2 macrophages (P=0.048).


Conclusions
In summary, we explored the immune signature of BC and constructed a TAIG risk model to predict prognosis. Moreover, we integrated the identified immune signature with tumour-infiltrating immune cells and found adverse associations between the TAIG levels and immune cell infiltrating density.",2019,Annals of translational medicine

Exploring the use of machine learning for risk adjustment: A comparison of standard and penalized linear regression models in predicting health care costs in older adults,"BACKGROUND
Payers and providers still primarily use ordinary least squares (OLS) to estimate expected economic and clinical outcomes for risk adjustment purposes. Penalized linear regression represents a practical and incremental step forward that provides transparency and interpretability within the familiar regression framework. This study conducted an in-depth comparison of prediction performance of standard and penalized linear regression in predicting future health care costs in older adults.


METHODS AND FINDINGS
This retrospective cohort study included 81,106 Medicare Advantage patients with 5 years of continuous medical and pharmacy insurance from 2009 to 2013. Total health care costs in 2013 were predicted with comorbidity indicators from 2009 to 2012. Using 2012 predictors only, OLS performed poorly (e.g., R2 = 16.3%) compared to penalized linear regression models (R2 ranging from 16.8 to 16.9%); using 2009-2012 predictors, the gap in prediction performance increased (R2:15.0% versus 18.0-18.2%). OLS with a reduced set of predictors selected by lasso showed improved performance (R2 = 16.6% with 2012 predictors, 17.4% with 2009-2012 predictors) relative to OLS without variable selection but still lagged behind the prediction performance of penalized regression. Lasso regression consistently generated prediction ratios closer to 1 across different levels of predicted risk compared to other models.


CONCLUSIONS
This study demonstrated the advantages of using transparent and easy-to-interpret penalized linear regression for predicting future health care costs in older adults relative to standard linear regression. Penalized regression showed better performance than OLS in predicting health care costs. Applying penalized regression to longitudinal data increased prediction accuracy. Lasso regression in particular showed superior prediction ratios across low and high levels of predicted risk. Health care insurers, providers and policy makers may benefit from adopting penalized regression such as lasso regression for cost prediction to improve risk adjustment and population health management and thus better address the underlying needs and risk of the populations they serve.",2019,PLoS ONE
The Iterated Lasso for High-Dimensional Logistic Regression By,"We consider an iterated Lasso approach for variable selection and estimation in sparse, high-dimensional logistic regression models. In this approach, we use the Lasso (Tibshirani 1996) to obtain an initial estimator and reduce the dimension of the model. We then use the Lasso as the initial estimator in the adaptive Lasso (Zou 2006) to obtain the final selection and estimation results. We provide conditions under which this two-step approach possesses asymptotic oracle selection and estimation properties. One important aspect of our results is that the total number of covariates can be larger than the sample size. Simulation studies indicate that the iterated Lasso has superior performance in variable selection relative to the standard Lasso. A data example is used to illustrate the proposed approach.",2008,
Analyzing Large Workersâ€™ Compensation Claims Using Generalized Linear Models and Monte Carlo Simulation,"Insurance practitioners rely on statistical models to predict future claims in order to provide financial protection. Proper predictive statistical modeling is more challenging when analyzing claims with lower frequency, but high costs. The paper investigated the use of predictive generalized linear models (GLMs) to address this challenge. Workersâ€™ compensation claims with costs equal to or more than US$100,000 were analyzed in agribusiness industries in the Midwest of the USA from 2008 to 2016. Predictive GLMs were built with gamma, Weibull, and lognormal distributions using the lasso penalization method. Monte Carlo simulation models were developed to check the performance of predictive models in cost estimation. The results show that the GLM with gamma distribution has the highest predictivity power (R2 = 0.79). Injury characteristics and workerâ€™s occupation were predictive of large claimsâ€™ occurrence and costs. The conclusions of this study are useful in modifying and estimating insurance pricing within high-risk agribusiness industries. The approach of this study can be used as a framework to forecast workersâ€™ compensation claims amounts with rare, high-cost events in other industries. This work is useful for insurance practitioners concerned with statistical and predictive modeling in financial risk analysis.",2018,Safety
A regression approach for explaining manifold embedding coordinates,"Manifold embedding algorithms map high dimensional data, down to coordinates in a much lower dimensional space. One of the aims of the dimension reduction is to find the {\em intrinsic coordinates} that describe the data manifold. However, the coordinates returned by the embedding algorithm are abstract coordinates. Finding their physical, domain related meaning is not formalized and left to the domain experts. This paper studies the problem of recovering the domain-specific meaning of the new low dimensional representation in a semi-automatic, principled fashion. We propose a method to explain embedding coordinates on a manifold as {\em non-linear} compositions of functions from a user-defined dictionary. We show that this problem can be set up as a sparse {\em linear Group Lasso} recovery problem, find sufficient recovery conditions, and demonstrate its effectiveness on data.",2018,ArXiv
QSS-dissipativity and feedback QS-passivity of nonlinear discrete-time systems,"Dissipativity and feedback passivity properties in nonlinear multiple-inputmultiple-output (MIMO) discrete-time systems are examined. Three main results are presented. First, necessary and sufficient conditions for the characterization of a class ofdissipative nonlinear MIMO discrete-time systems in general form are proposed. The classof dissipativity treated is referred to as Quadratic Storage Supply-dissipativity. The conditionsexisting in the literature, addressed as Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov conditions, for thedissipative, passive or lossless cases, are derived from the proposed dissipativity characterization. Second, some relative degree-related properties of nonlinear MIMO QuadraticStorage-passive systems which are affine in the input are stated. Third, the problem of rendering a nonlinear affine-in-input MIMO discrete-time system passive using the propertiesof the relative degree and zero dynamics is analyzed. Quadratic Storage-passive systemsare considered. The feedback passivity methodology is illustrated by means of a class ofsystems modelling different discrete dynamics with physical interpretation.",2007,Dynamics of Continuous Discrete and Impulsive Systems-series B-applications & Algorithms
The joint graphical lasso for inverse covariance estimation across multiple classes.,"We consider the problem of estimating multiple related Gaussian graphical models from a high-dimensional data set with observations belonging to distinct classes. We propose the joint graphical lasso, which borrows strength across the classes in order to estimate multiple graphical models that share certain characteristics, such as the locations or weights of nonzero edges. Our approach is based upon maximizing a penalized log likelihood. We employ generalized fused lasso or group lasso penalties, and implement a fast ADMM algorithm to solve the corresponding convex optimization problems. The performance of the proposed method is illustrated through simulated and real data examples.",2014,"Journal of the Royal Statistical Society. Series B, Statistical methodology"
Climate Change Is Not a Problem: Speculative Realism at the End of Organization,"In this paper, we trace the compounding and escalation of frames to try and encompass the reality of climate change. These frames capture significant aspects, revealing new contours and extreme organizational challenges. However, what if climate change is unframeable? We locate three ontological dimensions of climate change â€“ its unboundedness, incalculability and unthinkability â€“ that make this case. This means that climate change is not a problem that organizations can encompass, divide or draw lines around â€“ some â€˜thingâ€™ that can be recuperated into existing institutional, infrastructural and interpersonal frameworks. Instead, it is calling forth forms of organization without any precedent. We argue that the philosophy of speculative realism, specifically the work of Quentin Meillassoux, reveals climate change as a new World for which we do not have categories. We deploy Meillassouxâ€™s concepts which are non-human and rational to think through what climate change is ontologically. Meillassouxâ€™s work is characterized as the reintroduction of the old philosophical idea of the absolute, and we use it as a possible way to overcome the equivocal status of climate change without succumbing to despondency and passivity. Rather than a negative, overwhelming threat, climate change gives us what we call a bleak optimism: the realization that climate change has already happened, and that human civilization must learn how to die in a way that is a creative and just foreclosure of the Earthâ€™s organizational forms.",2019,Organization Studies
"Coastal fish diversity of the Socotra Archipelago, Yemen.","The Socotra Archipelago, located in the eastern Gulf of Aden, has a unique marine environment which combines tropical and 'pseudo-temperate' elements. Studies on the fish biogeography of the archipelago, partially framed in regional studies, have substantially outpaced critical elementary research on the archipelago's fish diversity. The present study seeks to close this gap and identifies the Socotra Archipelago as a major hotspot of coastal fish diversity in the Indian Ocean.Â Â Â Â Â Â  The archipelago supports unique coastal fish assemblages which are predominantly composed of coral-associated (""reef"") species, in spite of the limited biogenic reef frameworks. A Preliminary Checklist comprises 682 species with confirmed records and a ""Working List"" includes an additional 51 records, totalling 733 faunal records in 108 families. The family Labridae is the most speciose, followed by Gobiidae, Pomacentridae, Serranidae and Chaetodontidae. The species richness of the archipelago is the highest when compared to adjacent Arabian ecoregions. The richness of the Acanthuridae, Chaetodontidae, Labridae, Pomacentridae and Pseudochromidae stand out as particularily high, and the richness of several families is as high as or higher than in the entire Red Sea. The total archipelagic richness is extrapolated at up to 875 species based on incidence-based richness models and expert opinion. Inshore fish inventories, covering 497 species, found between 14 and 132 species per site (xÌ„ = 66). Site diversity decreased across the archipelago from west to east and from north to south. Total fish diversity was highest around Socotra Island, followed by Abd al-Kuri Kal Farun and Darsa Samha. Occurrence frequencies were very unevenly distributed and dominated by Pomacentrus caeruleus and Thalassoma lunare, whilst many species were infrequent. The fish assemblages are dominated by species from the Indo-West Pacific and the north-western Indian Ocean. The assemblages are rich in rare species and hybrids, and include a low number of endemics (4-5), and a high number of species with far-reaching and Western Indian Ocean ranges.",2019,Zootaxa
Produzione e caratterizzazione di schiume bidimensionali,"Una schiuma acquosa e una dispersione concentrata di bolle gassose in una soluzione 
liquida di acqua e particolari sostanze, dette surfattanti, che facilitano la formazione e la stabilizzazione della schiuma stessa. 
Un parametro che caratterizza significativamente la struttura e il comportamento di una schiuma e la sua frazione di liquido, pari al rapporto tra volume di liquido e volume totale della schiuma. Al tendere a zero della frazione di liquido, le bolle assumono forma sempre piu poliedrica e la schiuma in questione e detta ""dry foam''. 
Caratteristica ineluttabile delle schiume acquose, e l'instabilita. La loro evoluzione temporale volge irreversibilmente verso la diminuzione del numero totale di bolle e del volume della schiuma fino al loro totale collasso. Inoltre, l'elevato numero di interfacce liquido-gas in una schiuma fa si che la luce venga riflessa e rifratta numerose volte nell'attraversare il sistema: sono quindi necessarie specifiche tecniche di visualizzazione per l'osservazione di sistemi tridimensionali, altrimenti opachi. Si possono pero realizzare anche schiume bidimensionali. Queste risultano molto piu stabili di quelle 3D e piu facili da visualizzare. Questa rete di interfacce e anche responsabile di un gran numero di complesse proprieta. Ad essere sfruttate sono soprattutto le proprieta reologiche uniche delle schiume. Queste infatti, possono comportarsi come un solido elastico o plastico, ma anche come un liquido viscoso a seconda di come vengono manipolate. 
Le proprieta fisiche di una schiuma dipendono in modo cruciale dalle caratteristiche della sua struttura. In passato si e sviluppato un gran numero di diverse tecniche di produzione per avere controllo su di esse. Nel caso in esame, l'interesse e lo studio del flusso di sistemi bidimensionali di schiume in canali microfluidici in presenza di ostacoli di dimensione comparabile a quella delle bolle. Per poter fare cio, si e dovuta individuare una tecnica che permettesse di ottenere una schiuma sufficientemente stabile da supportare il flusso per tutta la durata delle misure e tale da avere: bolle di dimensione uniforme (altrimenti non sarebbe possibile la distribuzione della schiuma su un unico strato), frazione di liquido trascurabile (altrimenti la dinamica di scorrimento sarebbe sostanzialmente dominata dalla fase liquida), bolle di dimensione sulla scala del micrometro. 
A tal fine si sono tentate due diverse tecniche, che hanno portato ad avvicinarsi sempre di piu al risultato cercato, seppur con qualche aspetto ancora da chiarire. Il primo metodo, sfrutta due siringhe con le uscite connesse una contenente aria e l'altra la soluzione acquosa. Premendo alternatamente gli stantuffi si viene a creare una schiuma. Con il secondo metodo invece, si generano le singole bolle direttamente nella soluzione liquida immettendo aria, tramite un generatore di pressione costante, da un capillare di dimensioni micrometriche e realizzando cosi un gorgogliatore. 
Lo scopo della presente tesi e descrivere tali metodi testati e analizzare i risultati ottenuti da ciascuno di essi al fine di individuarne le problematiche e progettare ulteriori possibili migliorie. 
 
[An aqueous foam is a concentrated dispersion of gaseous bubbles in a solution 
liquid water and special substances, called surfactants, which facilitate the formation and stabilization of the foam itself. 
A parameter that significantly affects the structure and behavior of a foam is its liquid fraction, which is the ratio between the volume of liquid and the total volume of the foam. As the liquid fraction tends to zero, bubbles take on an increasingly polyhedral shape and the foam becomes a ""dry foam"". 
An inevitable feature of aqueous foams is instability. Their ageing causes a decrease in the total number of bubbles and in the volume of foam until eventually the foam collapses completely. 
Furthermore, the high number of liquid-gas interfaces in a foam causes the light to be reflected and refracted numerous times when crossing the system: specific visualization techniques are thus necessary for the observation of three-dimensional systems, otherwise opaque. However, there are also two-dimensional foams which are much more stable than 3D ones and easier to visualize. This network of interfaces is also responsible for a great number of complex properties. The most interesting are their unique rheological properties. As a matter of fact, foams can behave as both an elastic or plastic solid, but also as a viscous liquid depending on how they are handled. 
The physical properties of a foam are strongly linked to their structure. In the past, many different production techniques have been developed to control them. In this case, the objective is the study of the flow of two-dimensional foam systems in microfluidic channels in the presence of obstacles of size comparable to that of bubbles. In order to do this, it was necessary to identify a technique that would allow to obtain a sufficiently stable foam to support the flow for the whole duration of the measurements. Such a foam would also need to have: bubbles of uniform size (otherwise it would not be possible to distribute the foam on a single layer), small liquid fraction (otherwise the flow dynamics would be substantially dominated by the liquid phase), bubbles size on the scale of the micrometer. 
In order to obtain such a foam, two different techniques have been adopted, leading closer and closer to the result sought, though some aspects have yet to be clarified. The first method uses two syringes with their exits connected. One contains air and the other the aqueous solution. Pressing the plungers alternately creates a foam. With the second method, the individual bubbles are generated directly in the liquid solution by introducing air, via a constant pressure generator, from a capillary of micrometric dimensions. 
The purpose of this thesis is to describe these tested methods and analyze the results obtained with each of them in order to identify the problems and plan further possible improvements.]",2019,
In Search for Symbolic Qualities of Iron: The Metal of Life,"Iron, classically known as the Metal of Mars, has been universally perceived as the symbol of human strength, obstinacy, fortitude, honor, courage, sharpness (of body and mind), tenacity, and confidence in power. Legendary personalities like the knight GÃ¶tz von Berlichingen (the one with prosthetic iron hands) or Margaret Thatcher (the iron lady) epitomized the metal properties in human character. However, it was in Rudyard Kiplingâ€™s poem â€œCold Ironâ€ that a pugnacious Baron elevates iron to a supreme level by proclaiming â€œcold iron asmaster of them allâ€ (leaving gold for the mistress and silver for the maid). Ironically, the Baronâ€™s strong belief in iron supremacy leads him to wage war against the King, but ends up defeated and humiliated. Although pardoned despite of betraying the King, he rather adheres to his original â€œiron masterâ€ creed to be sentenced with â€œiron out of Calvary is master of them all.â€ It is a question of interpretation whether or not the poem conveys a theological message or a metaphor for a feigned feeling of supremacy, its recurrent use by â€œsiderophilesâ€ as a symbol of ironâ€™s preponderance in living organisms is perplexing (Beutler, 2002; Sheftel et al., 2012). Shouldnâ€™t a more benevolent â€œmaster ironâ€ icon be adopted to represent iron as the metal of life? We learn from history that a symbolism based on genuine iron master qualities was proposed more than a quarter of a millennium ago (RodrÃ­guez MarÃ­n, 1925; Lasso de la Vega y Cortezo, 1988; Beutler, 2002; Sheftel et al., 2012; Beecher, 2015; Olmedilla y Puig, 2015). It was in 1574, in the town of Seville, the gateway to the recently discovered and conquered New World, where El SeÃ±or Doctor NicolÃ¡s Monardes (1493/1508?-1588) made public an essay entitled â€œDialogue about the grandeur of ironâ€ (which excels over other metals and is in highest demand to human service and of great medicinal qualities) (Monardes, 1549/1574) (Figure 1). The essay appears as a separate section in the Medicinal History of Plants Imported from the New World published together with two (previously published) sections and a new appended one (Monardes, 1549/1574)1. The author is a graduate in Arts and Philosophy (and later in Medicine) from the famous Universidad de AlcalÃ¡ de Henares, who excelled in the practice and writing of Medicine, Botany, and Alchemy. His contributions earned him honorary titles such as â€œFather of Spanish Pharmacologyâ€ and â€œDiscoverer of Fluorescence.â€ His associations with colonial traders of medicinal plants and minerals were instrumental in his scientific career as a botanist and in his medical practice. However, commercial misfortunes with overseas traders led him to declare bankruptcy and hide for a decade in a monastery, before managing to repay his creditors and to openly resume his medical practice and scientific endeavors. Monardes collected, studied, cataloged, and grew in his own garden some rare plants from which he made extracts that were applied to patients. He practiced medicine using classical books as well as novel information gathered from the American natives as guidelines. On the basis of Galenic medical reasoning",2016,Frontiers in Pharmacology
Geno- and Cyto-toxicity in Free-Living Rodent Mus spretus Exposed to Simulated Onshore Oil Spill,"AbstractThis study investigated geno- and cyto-toxic damage in the free-living rodent, Mus spretus after exposure to a simulated spill of crude oil on soil. The results revealed increased mutagenicity and cytotoxicity in bone marrow cells and increased DNA damage in blood cells. Exposure to crude oil increased sperm abnormalities, with lasso-like folds being the most common. These results point to the value of this rodent in serving as a sentinel species for the monitoring and prediction of environmental hazards.

Meaningful Prediction Parameters for Evaluating the Suitability of Power Tools for Usage,"Abstract During the usage of power tools, user and power tool are interacting strongly with each other, which is why the working result depends heavily on the usability of a power tool depending on the application (Suitability of Usage (SoU)). The optimization of power tools, in terms of the user-centered design, therefore aims at an increase of the SoU. So far, the acquisition of the SoU is done within broad application tests, with several users and different application situations. Hereby, problems occur because it is often difficult to find an adequate mix of professional trained participants, which are able to evaluate the SoU objectively. To investigate the differences between professional power tool users and trained non-professional users, a study has been performed. In this study, 20 professional and 19 non-professional users tested power tools (cordless screwdrivers and impact wrenches, three different manufacturer each) and evaluated the handles of these systems according to fourteen test items, divided into an observation and a usage phase. By the use of statistical variance analysis, the captured data has been analyzed to investigate the influence on the evaluation through the usage experience of the users. Results indicates a strong influence within the evaluation categories where evaluations are done which rely on long term experiences, like the evaluation of the distributed force on the fingers. To produce further increase in efficiency and objectivity, a categorical regression by the use of Lasso models has been performed to identify the most meaningful influencing predictors for the SoU level. The investigation is carried out using the example of the evaluation of discomfort on the handle. Results indicates that the most meaningful predictor for the evaluation of the handle is the circumference of the handle at the position of the middle finger.",2018,Procedia CIRP

Preliminary study on vertical distribution of microorganisms in the Bannock Basin waters (Eastern Mediterranean Sea),"Preliminary data are presented on microbial distribution in the Bannock Basin, a hypersaline and anoxic depression in the lower 3300 m of the water column. Epifluorescence microscopy was suitable for a first approach to enumeration of the microbial mass in water samples from this peculiar marine environment. Progressive increase in total microbial numbers occurs in the anoxic layer, with the highest value at 3331 m. Autofluorescing rnlcroorganlsms are also present. The Bannock Basin is an anoxic deep (ca 3790 m) basin, with gypsum precipitation and cold brines, situated in the Ionian Basin close to the Sirte Abyssal Plane (34"" 18' lat. N, 20"" 00' long. E) in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. The oxic-anoxic interface lies at ca 3300 m, at which depth oxygen is depleted and salinity and density are unusually high. Stratification prevents vertical mixing and results in an increase of hydrogen sulphide, probably due to bacterial activites. The Bannock Basin brine is the most concentrated of any other anoxic hypersaline basin known so far: Red Sea, Orca Basin and Tyro Basin. Moreover, it is the only one where gypsum precipitation is not due to hydrothermal activity. Previous research on water samples from the Bannock Basin and the overlying water reveals 4 layers with different characteristics. We report depths as pressure values (dbar), just Like the multiparameter probe measured, because the conversion equation to metres cannot be correctly applied in exceptionally high salinities and densities. In the first layer (from 0 to 3300 dbar), water shows the typical features of the Eastern Mediterranean Sea; in the second one (from 3300 to 3327 dbar), oxygen values fall instantaneously to zero, whereas salinity, nitrates, nitrites and phosphates increase and, in the deeper part of the layer, hydrogen sulphide begins to occur; the third layer (from 3327 to 3370 dbar) is characterized by a sharp increase in salinity (to 300%o), density and hydrogen O Inter-ResearchIPrinted in Germany sulphide, as well as absence of oxygen; it represents the first brine layer; the last layer (from 3370 dbar to the bottom) represents the brine body with chemical parameters similar to the foregoing layer with a maximum of 325.3 %D (Bregant et al. 1990). During a 1987 cruise, preliminary investigations revealed a normal distribution of culturable bacteria in the oxygenated layer of the Bannock Basin, but sporadic colonies grew from the anoxic and hypersaline samples (De Domenico & De Domenico 1989). In such extreme environments microbial populations should be highly specialized and differentiated; hence it is very difficult to enumerate them accurately by cultural methods. During a cruise in 1988, in order to estimate the total microbial number in the Bannock Basin (sub-basin Libeccio) and in the overlying water, a quantitative investigation applying a microscopic method was carried out. Microbial cells were enumerated using the ASTM method (1985), modified according to La Ferla et al. (1990). The number of autofluorescent microbial cells (photopicoplankton) was determined. Such microorganisms are part of the total microbial population and participate in the primary production of the sea (Fogg 1986, Li & Platt 1987). Such cells were detected according to El Hag & Fogg (1986). The saltiest samples caused methodological problems in cell counting, a s already mentioned by Harvey (1987) who studied meromictic saline lakes. In order to avoid these problems, several rinses on the filter or dilutions of the samples were carried out. Our results demonstrate the presence of an abundant microbial flora in Bannock Basin. The total microbial counts in the whole water column vary from 4.1 X 105 to 1.1 X 106 cells ml-l, with a n average of 7.2 X 105 cells ml-' (Fig. l). Autofluorescent microorganism counts range between 1.8 X 10' and 1.9 X 104 cells ml-l, with 310 Mar. Ecol. Prog.

Such organisms constitute approximately 0.6 O/O of the total microbial population. Regarding the microbial distributions in the water column, it is usual for microorganisms to decrease with increasing depth. However, microbial distributions are also related to the organic matter concentration and to hydrological phenomena such as the interface of water masses with different densities. Thus, the higher counts at 100 dbar (8.5 X lo5 cells ml-l) correspond with the DOC increase found by Henneke & de Lange (1989) during the same cruise. The increase in microbial abundance at 1000 dbar (9.5 X 105 cells ml-') is related to the different density of the deepest Mediterranean Sea water compared to the middle Levantine one (De Domenico et al. 1990). In the anoxic layer there is a progressive increase in the total number of microorganisms, with the highest value at 3331 dbar, l . e . higher than in the superficial layer The presence of brines corroborates this result and agrees with POC distribution a t the same depth (Henneke & d e Lange 1989). These authors hypothesize that the density discontinuity between oxic and anoxic waters allows the organic matter to accumulate at the interface. The importance of oceanic discontinuities (e. g. thermoclines, pycnoclines, ocean fronts, water mass interfaces) for production and maintenance of subsurface zones of elevated microbial biomass and activity is well known. Thus interfaces support the development of heterotrophic and, in this case, chemoautotrophic populations. Finally, the slight increase in values in the deepest sample is a normal phenomenon near the bottom in aquatic environments. La Ferla & Crisafi Vertical distribution of n~icroorganlsms in the Eastern Mediterranean 31 1 The number of phototrophic microorganisms is below normal values for oceanic sea waters (about 10' cells ml-l). The total microbial counts in relation to the autofluorescent cells reveal opposite trends from the surface to 400 dbar. According to Fogg (1986), the phototrophic picoplankton and the heterotrophic bacteria constitute a basic and ubiquitous planktonic community, and densities of both are determined by the dynamic balance between their growth in a closed selfsustaining cycle. The presence of autofluorescent cells at great depth is of particular ecological interest. The occurrence of these organisms with photosynthetic pigments below the photic zone is surprising. We suppose that these organisms are cyanobacteria, because they contain phycoerithrin as an intracellular nitrogen reserve to be used in case of need (Li & Platt 1987). The specific set of filters that we used permits counting of unicellular phycoerythrin-containing cyanobacteria, which can unambiguously be distinguished from other phytoplankton or bacteria by their characteristic orange autofluorescence, as asserted by Waterbury et al. (1979) and by El Hag & Fogg (1986). The ecological significance of such a pigment may not be limited to its functional photosynthetic role; its presence implies the existence of quiescent and conservative forms, sinking from euphotic layers. Further sampling is needed to confirm the preliminary data reported here. Acknowledgements.

Active Set Algorithms for the LASSO,"This thesis disserts on the computation of the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and derivate problems, in regression analysis. This operator has drawn increasing attention since its introduction by Robert Tibshirani in 1996, for its ability to provide or recover sparse linear models from noisy observations, sparsity meaning that only a few of possibly many explaining variables are selected to appear in the model. The selection is a result of adding to the least-squares method a constraint or minimization on the sum of absolute values of the linear coeffcients, otherwise called the l1 norm of the coefficient vector. After recounting the motivations, principles and problematics of regression analysis, linear estimators, least-squares minimization, model selection, and regularization, the two equivalent formulations of the LASSO constrained or regularized are presented, that both define a non-trivial computation problem to associate an estimator to a set of observations and a selection parameter. A brief history of algorithms for solving these problems is given, as well as the two possible approaches for handling the non differentiability of the l1 norm, and the equivalence to a quadratic program is explained. The second part focuses on practical algorithms for solving the LASSO. An algorithm proposed in 2000 by Michael Osborne is reformulated. This reformulation consists in giving a general definition and explanation of the active set method, that generalizes the simplex algorithm to convex programming, then specifying it to the LASSO program, and separately addressing linear algebra optimizations. Although it describes the same algorithm in essence, the presentation given here aims at exhibiting clearly its mechanisms, and uses different variables. In addition to helping understand and use this algorithm that seemed to be underrated, the alternative view taken here brings light on the possibility and advantages, not foreseen by the authors, to use the method for the regularized (and more practical) problem, as well as for the constrained one. The popular homotopy (or LAR-LASSO) method is then derived from this active set method, yelding also an alternative and somewhat simplifed view of this algorithm that can compute the operator for all values of its parameter (LASSO path). Practical implementations following these formulations are shown to be the most efficient methods of LASSO-path computation, contrasting with a recent study of Jerome H. Friedman suggesting that a coordinate descent method improves by far the state-of-the-art results of homotopy, interms of speed. The third part examines how these three algorithms (active set, homotopy, and coordinate descent) can handle some limit cases, and can be applied to extended problems. The limit cases include degeneracies, like duplicated or lin- early dependent variables, or simultaneous selections/deselections of variables. The latter issue, that was dismissed in previous works, is explained and given a simple solution. Another limit case is the use of a very large, possibly infinite number of variables to select from, where the active set method presents a major advantage over the homotopy. A first extension to the LASSO is its transposition in online learning settings, where it is necessary or desirable to solve for a growing or changing observation set. Again, the lack of flexibility of the homotopy method discards it in profit of the other two. The second extension is the use of l1 penalization with other loss function than the squared residual, or together with other penalization terms, and we summarize or state to which extent and how each algorithm can be transposed for these problems.",2011,
Genomic-Enabled Prediction Based on Molecular Markers and Pedigree Using the Bayesian Linear Regression Package in R.,"The availability of dense molecular markers has made possible the use of genomic selection in plant and animal breeding. However, models for genomic selection pose several computational and statistical challenges and require specialized computer programs, not always available to the end user and not implemented in standard statistical software yet. The R-package BLR (Bayesian Linear Regression) implements several statistical procedures (e.g., Bayesian Ridge Regression, Bayesian LASSO) in a unifi ed framework that allows including marker genotypes and pedigree data jointly. This article describes the classes of models implemented in the BLR package and illustrates their use through examples. Some challenges faced when applying genomic-enabled selection, such as model choice, evaluation of predictive ability through cross-validation, and choice of hyper-parameters, are also addressed.",2010,The plant genome
Network estimation in econometrics,This work proposes novel network analysis techniques for time series. We define the network of a multivariate time series as an undirected graph where nodes denote the components of the process and edges denote nonzero long run partial correlation between two components. Long run partial correlation is a comprehensive measure of cross-sectional conditional dependence for time series capturing contemporaneous as well as lead/lag relations. The procedure is based on a two step LASSO regression of the VAR approximation of the process.,2013,"Advances in Latent Variables - Methods, Models and Applications"
Identification of Critical-to-quality Characteristic in Complex Products Based on the Adaptive-Lasso Method,"Targeting the problem of the redundancy in complex product quality characteristics, the Adaptive-Lasso method is introduced into the identification of Critical-to-quality Characteristic. By using the Adaptive-Lasso method to filter variables, reduce the dimensions of the original quality data sample set, and obtain the order of the correlation between the quality Characteristics in the sample set and the quality category, the quality Characteristics with the highest classification correct ratio are selected to form the Critical-to-quality Characteristic subset. On this basis, the classification correct ratio of the selected Characteristic subset is tested by using the support vector machine. The example shows that compared with the traditional ReliefF method and Lasso method, this method can effectively remove the irrelevant and redundant features in the original data set to achieve the purpose of identifying the Critical-to-quality Characteristic.",2019,"2019 IEEE 4th Advanced Information Technology, Electronic and Automation Control Conference (IAEAC)"
Ultrahigh Dimensional Variable Selection for Mapping Soil Carbon,"Modern soil mapping is characterised by the need to interpolate samples of geostatistical response observations and the availability of relatively large numbers of environmental characteristics for consideration as covariates to aid this interpolation. We demonstrate the efficiency of the Least Angle Regression algorithm for Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) penalized multiple linear regression at selecting covariates to aid the spatial interpolation of geostatistical soil carbon observations under an ultrahigh dimensional scenario. Where an exhaustive search of the models that could be constructed from 800 potential covariate terms and 60 observations would be prohibitively demanding, LASSO variable selection is accomplished with trivial computational investment.",2016,
Group lassoing change-points in piecewise-constant AR processes,"Regularizing the least-squares criterion with the total number of coefficient changes, it is possible to estimate time-varying (TV) autoregressive (AR) models with piecewise-constant coefficients. Such models emerge in various applications including speech segmentation, biomedical signal processing, and geophysics. To cope with the inherent lack of continuity and the high computational burden when dealing with high-dimensional data sets, this article introduces a convex regularization approach enabling efficient and continuous estimation of TV-AR models. To this end, the problem is cast as a sparse regression one with grouped variables, and is solved by resorting to the group least-absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso). The fresh look advocated here permeates benefits from advances in variable selection and compressive sampling to signal segmentation. An efficient block-coordinate descent algorithm is developed to implement the novel segmentation method. Issues regarding regularization and uniqueness of the solution are also discussed. Finally, an alternative segmentation technique is introduced to improve the detection of change instants. Numerical tests using synthetic and real data corroborate the merits of the developed segmentation techniques in identifying piecewise-constant TV-AR models.",2012,EURASIP Journal on Advances in Signal Processing
The Sea: Thalassography and Historiography,"The Sea brings together a group of noted contributors to evaluate the different ways in which seas have served as subjects in historiography and asks how this has changed---and will change---the way history is written. The essays in this volume provide exemplary demonstrations of how a sea-based history-writing that focuses on connectivity, networks, and individuals describes the horizons and the potential of thalassography---the study of the world made by individuals imbedded in networks of motion. As Peter Miller contends in his introduction, writing about the sea, today, is a way of partaking in the wider historiographical shift toward microhistory; exchange relations; networks; and, above all, materiality, both literally and figuratively. The Sea focuses not on questions of discipline and professionalisation as much as on the practice of scholarship: the writing, and therefore the planning and organising, of histories of the sea.",2013,
A gymnosperm affinity for Ricciisporites tuberculatus Lundblad: implications for vegetation and environmental reconstructions in the Late Triassic,"Ricciisporites tuberculatus Lundblad is a prominently sculptured palynomorph that is dispersed at maturity as tetrads. It has a wide geographic distribution and reaches a stratigraphically important acme in the Norian and Rhaetian of Europe. As it has not yet been found in situ in a fossilized reproductive structure, its botanical affinity is poorly understood. Recent work on the morphology and ultrastructure of R. tuberculatus favours an affinity with gymnosperms rather than spore plants. In the present contribution, we re-evaluate Triassicâ€“Jurassic (Tr-J) palynological records and discuss the consequences of a gymnosperm affinity for R. tuberculatus for Late Triassic vegetation reconstruction, as well as inferred palaeoecological interpretations. At a Tr-J boundary locality in East Greenland, the relative abundance of R. tuberculatus through time is similar to the Bennettitales Anomozamites and Pterophyllum. We suggest that R. tuberculatus may have been produced by a gymnosperm characterised by an herbaceous ruderal life habit. The poor preservation potential of the vegetative structures of such a plant may explain why R. tuberculatus has not yet been found in situ in a fossil reproductive structure. Moreover, principal component analysis of Late Triassic palynological records show that the vectors of R. tuberculatus and the common pollen type Classopollis plot in opposite directions. We suggest that the parent plants of R. tuberculatus and Classopollis (the Cheirolepidiaceae) may have had different ecological and/or climatological preferences.",2014,Palaeobiodiversity and Palaeoenvironments
Influenza A virus induces regulated T cell-driven B cell responses,"Protection from influenza A virus (IAV) challenge requires switched, high affinity Abs derived from long-lived memory B cells and plasma cells. These subsets are generated in germinal centers (GCs), hallmark structures of T helper cell-driven B cell immunity. A full understanding of the acute and persistent GC B cell reaction following respiratory IAV infection is lacking, as is the characterization of IAV-induced T follicular helper (TFH) cells that support GCs. Additionally, it remains unclear as to whether IAV-induced GC B cells are subject to control by regulatory T cells (Tregs). To address this, GC B cell and TFH cell responses were analyzed in mice following pulmonary challenge with IAV. Studies demonstrated that marked GC reactions were induced in lung-draining lymph nodes (dLNs), lung, spleen and nasalassociated lymphoid tissue (NALT), although the magnitude, kinetics, and isotype switching patterns of the response was site-specific, and largely depended on the magnitude of IAV-induced TFH cell populations. TFH cell magnitude peaked prior to that of GC B cells in all tissues, and TFH cells purified from dLNs generated IL-21 and IFNÎ³ upon activation, although CD4CXCR5 T effector cells produced higher levels of all cytokines. IgA GC B cells were infrequent in most sites, but composed a significant subset of the switched GC population in NALT. Further, splenectomized mice withstood a lethal recall challenge, suggesting the spleen to be unnecessary for long-term protection. Additionally, GC B cell populations were analyzed at distal time points to assess the understudied, persistent GC B cell response after IAV infection. Our analysis demonstrated that persistent GC B cell populations in mouse lungs directly correlated with infectious dose, pathogenicity of the virus, as well as the presence of long-term CD4 T cell help. Finally, experiments showed that Tregs contribute to the control of GCs induced in the spleen by IAV challenge. This was demonstrated by a marked increase in the",2012,

Density evolution of sparse source signals,"A sequential Bayesian approach to density evolution for sparse source reconstruction is proposed and analysed which alternatingly solves a generalized LASSO problem and its dual. Waves are observed by a sensor array. The waves are emitted by a spatially-sparse set of sources. A weighted Laplace-like prior is assumed for the sources such that the maximum a posteriori source estimate at the current time step is the solution to a generalized LASSO problem. The posterior Laplace-like density at step k is approximated by the corresponding dual solution. The posterior density at step k leads to the prior density at k+1 by applying a motion model. Thus, a sequence of generalized LASSO problems is solved for estimating the temporal evolution of a sparse source field.",2015,"2015 3rd International Workshop on Compressed Sensing Theory and its Applications to Radar, Sonar and Remote Sensing (CoSeRa)"

"On the return of the (media) author: Michel Houellebecq, Ã©crivain mÃ©diatique","This article argues that Michel Houellebecq is an Ã©crivain mÃ©diatique, a media author, and examines how and why he engages in a type of authorial strategy that relies on more than the text and presents the author as a multimedia, visible and culturally relevant figure. It will address how Houellebecq attempts to situate and justify this media-focused and author-centric strategy, showing how this reflects a broader sociocultural shift. The article will first deal with the concept of media authorship, defining and situating it, to show how Houellebecq can productively be understood as an Ã©crivain mÃ©diatique. The type of authorship that Houellebecq represents through use of more than the text but media activities and opportunities for visibility presents us with an epistemological need to reassess literary authorship in the media age. This article engages with critical tools that are able to address new authorial strategies. Firstly, this article will address JÃ©rÃ´me Meizozâ€™s concept of posturing (2007) as a productive lens through which to understand Houellebecq's polemical public persona as it oscillates in and out of his novels. In doing so, the article considers how his posturing indicates a reliance on visibility for success in the contemporary sociocultural context. Secondly, the article examines the range of Houellebecqâ€™s multimedia activities and creations beyond the text, including adaptations, albums, exhibitions, films, photography, and media appearances, decentring the text as part of a broader transmedial whole, using Richard Saint-Gelaisâ€™ concept of transmediality (2011). This will show how Houellebecq is producing a multimedia world beyond the text and constructing himself as more than an author. Finally, this article discusses the evocation of social discourse, to use Marc Angenotâ€™s term (1989), in Houellebecqâ€™s works as a means to present a digital and mass media orientated cultural context in order to justify and rationalise his media-focused acts. These tools provide a framework that enables us to better evidence and understand Houellebecqâ€™s focus beyond the text. This strategy for successful authorship, reliant on mediatisation and multimedia, reflects the challenges of the cultural domination of mass media and new technologies of the Digital Age and indicates that the autonomy of the literary field is diminishing as it comes under the increased influence of industry, and other media forms and cultural fields. This article will show how a superficially transgressive engagement with the media and multimedia in fact reflects consent to the dynamics and values of the contemporary sociocultural context. On the Return of the (Media) Author: Michel Houellebecq, Ã©crivain mÃ©diatique On January 4th 2019, Michel Houellebecqâ€™s novel SÃ©rotonine was released to much media fanfare. Prior to its release, magazines including Les Inrockuptibles and Lâ€™Obs defied Flammarionâ€™s embargo on the publication of articles on the novel in December. Within two days, 90,000 copies were sold and the novel topped the French literary sales lists, adding to Houellebecq's total sales of over five million copies of his texts. Despite this excitement around the novel and its successful sales, Houellebecq was not on the literary scene and did not commit to a single interview to discuss this work. Instead, his presence was asserted in other ways and places unrelated to the novel. Indeed, he penned a polemical article in English on American politics for Harperâ€™s January edition entitled â€˜Donald Trump is a Good Presidentâ€™ (Houellebecq and Cullen, 2019). He also released the official photographs from his marriage, following the unofficial photographs shared by guest Carla Bruni-Sarkozy in October 2018. Additionally, details were published about Houellebecqâ€™s role in a film directed by Nicloux, entitled Thalasso, depicting Houellebecq and GÃ©rard Depardieuâ€™s fictionalised stay at a health spa.1 Reflecting this mediatisation and multimedia engagement, magazine Les Inrockuptibles marked SÃ©rotonineâ€™s publication by releasing a collection of their collaborations with Houellebecq, one that presented an author who has for a long time been seeking to engage with more than the novel, including an interview with Iggy Pop, his chanson franÃ§aise playlist, and an interview with Emmanuel Macron where itâ€™s unclear who is interviewing whom (Les Inrockuptibles, 2019).2 Despite this absence of engagement with his new novel, or in fact instead of engagement with it, Houellebecq still commanded a widespread media presence. This article seeks to explain how and why mediatisation and multimedia are central to Houellebecq's strategy for success. This article argues that Michel Houellebecq is an Ã©crivain mÃ©diatique, a media author, and examines how and why he engages in a type of authorial strategy that relies on more than the text and presents the author as a multimedia, visible and culturally relevant figure. It will address how Houellebecq attempts to situate and justify this media-focused and author-centric strategy, showing how this reflects a broader sociocultural shift. This strategy for successful authorship, reliant on mediatisation and multimedia, reflects the challenges of the cultural domination of mass media and new technologies of the Digital Age and indicates that the autonomy of the literary field is diminishing as it comes under the increased influence of industry, other cultural fields and media forms.

I will first deal with the concept of media authorship, defining and situating it, to show how Houellebecq can productively be understood as an Ã©crivain mÃ©diatique. The type of authorship that Houellebecq represents through use of more than the text but media activities and opportunities for visibility presents us with an epistemological need to reassess literary authorship in the media age. New critical tools able to address new authorial strategies are needed. I will engage with three such tools that can enable us to approach Houellebecq (and peers), as an Ã©crivain mÃ©diatique, to elucidate what he is doing and the motivations for this. Firstly, this article will address Meizozâ€™s concept of posturing (2007) as a productive lens through which to understand Houellebecq's polemical public persona as it oscillates in and out of his novels. In doing so, I will consider how his posturing indicates a reliance on visibility for success in the contemporary sociocultural context.

Finally, I will discuss the evocation of social discourse, to use Angenotâ€™s term (1989), in Houellebecqâ€™s works as a means to present a digital and mass media orientated cultural context in order to rationalise his media-focused acts. These tools provide a framework that enables us to better evidence and understand his focus beyond the text. This is the first study to focus on the role, signification and relevance of the concept of the media author3 in the contemporary French literary field.4 It analyses the notion of the media writer as an authorial strategy and posture, and its creative consequences. This article seeks to contribute to current scholarship in several ways; first, it adds to current academic work on Houellebecq, illustrating a new way of understanding the interest in the author figure and filling gaps in research in regard to his posttextuality, mediatisation and media usage. Since its very beginnings, the polemical nature of Houellebecqâ€™s novels and interviews, and the extensive press coverage of these, has resulted in academic interest in reception, authorial intention and the role of the author.5 Critics have made value judgements on his work, some criticizing6 and some defending him.7 This tropisme de lâ€™opinion is exceptional, as Estier (2013:106) has noted: â€˜Houellebecq tend Ã  apparaÃ®tre comme un Ã©crivain hors-normes, difficile Ã  situer, ambigu, ambivalent, paradoxal, iconoclaste.â€™ This article seeks to respond by situating Houellebecq as a media author, showing how this helps us better understand his strategies in and out of the novel. The article tackles the scarcity of critical writing on Houellebecq's use of media,8 despite his vast range of multimedia engagements. Secondly, this article addresses contemporary authorship from fresh socio-literary perspectives, contributing to the bourgeoning study of posturing, transmediality, and social discourse, applying these methods in new ways to current examples and translating them for use in anglophone scholarship. Thirdly, the article extends beyond French Literary Studies into other disciplines including Sociocultural and Media Studies, proving its relevance to other fields. Finally, it produces a methodological framework to be applied to other media authors in other comparative cultural contexts. Media Authorship: Michel Houellebecq, Ã©crivain mÃ©diatique In 1986, Pierre Nora published the second volume of Les Lieux de mÃ©moire, a collective history of the sites de mÃ©moire where French collective memory has crystallized around significant places, events and objects.

A Bayesian network analysis of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms in adults reporting childhood sexual abuse,"ABSTRACT Background: The network approach to mental disorders offers a novel framework for conceptualizing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a causal system of interacting symptoms. Objective: In this study, we extended this work by estimating the structure of relations among PTSD symptoms in adults reporting personal histories of childhood sexual abuse (CSA; N = 179). Method: We employed two complementary methods. First, using the graphical LASSO, we computed a sparse, regularized partial correlation network revealing associations (edges) between pairs of PTSD symptoms (nodes). Next, using a Bayesian approach, we computed a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to estimate a directed, potentially causal model of the relations among symptoms. Results: For the first network, we found that physiological reactivity to reminders of trauma, dreams about the trauma, and lost of interest in previously enjoyed activities were highly central nodes. However, stability analyses suggest that these findings were unstable across subsets of our sample. The DAG suggests that becoming physiologically reactive and upset in response to reminders of the trauma may be key drivers of other symptoms in adult survivors of CSA. Conclusions: Our study illustrates the strengths and limitations of these network analytic approaches to PTSD.",2017,European Journal of Psychotraumatology
"Syphilis among Female Sex Workers: Results of Point-of-Care Screening during a Cross-Sectional Behavioral Survey in Burkina Faso, West Africa","Background
Syphilis among female sex workers (FSW) remains a public health concern due to its potential impact on their health and the possibility of transmission to their clients, partners, and children. Recent data on the prevalence of syphilis in the population in West Africa are scarce. The objective of this study was to measure the seroprevalence of syphilis serological markers among female sex workers in Burkina Faso.


Methods
We conducted a cross-sectional survey among FSW between February 2013 and May 2014. Participants were recruited using respondent-driven sampling (RDS) methods in five cities of Burkina Faso (Ouagadougou, Bobo-Dioulasso, Koudougou, Ouahigouya, and Tenkodogo). FSW were enrolled and screened for syphilis using a syphilis serological rapid diagnostic test. Data from all cities were analyzed with Stata version 14.0.


Results
A total of 1045 FSW were screened for syphilis. Participants' mean age was 27.2 Â± 0.2 years. The syphilis serological markers were detected in 5.6% (95% CI: 4.4-7.2) of the participants whereas active syphilis was seen in 1.4% (95% CI: 0.9-2.4). RDS weighted prevalence of syphilis serological markers and active syphilis by city were, respectively, estimated to be 0.0% to 11.0% (95% CI: 8.1-14.7) and 0.0% to 2.2% (95% CI: 1.1-4.4). No syphilis markers were found among Ouahigouya FSW. Low education level and high number of clients were factors associated with syphilis markers among the FSW.


Conclusion
The prevalence of syphilis markers was high during this study among FSW. This highlights the need to reinforce the comprehensive preventive measures and treatment of syphilis in this population.",2018,International Journal of Microbiology
Simulation Screening Experiments Using Lasso-optimal Supersaturated Design and Analysis : a Maritime Operations Application,"Screening methods are beneficial for studies involving simulations that have a large number of variables where a relatively small (but unknown) subset is important. In this paper, we show how a newly proposed Lasso-optimal screening design and analysis method can be useful for efficiently conducting simulation screening experiments. Our approach uses new criteria for generating supersaturated designs, and a new algorithm for selecting the optimal tuning parameters for Lasso model selection. We generate a 24x69 Lasso optimal supersaturated design, illustrate its potential with a numerical evaluation, and apply it to an agent-based simulation of maritime escort operations in the Strait of Gibraltar. This application is part of a larger project that seeks to leverage simulation models during the ship design process, and so construct ships that are both cost effective and operationally effective. The supersaturated screening design has already proved beneficial for model verification and validation.",2015,

The Generalized Lasso for Sub-gaussian Observations with Dithered Quantization,"In the problem of structured signal recovery from high-dimensional linear observations, it is commonly assumed that full-precision measurements are available. Under this assumption, the recovery performance of the popular Generalized Lasso (G-Lasso) is by now well-established. In this paper, we extend these types of results to the practically relevant settings with quantized measurements. We study two extremes of the quantization schemes, namely, uniform and one-bit quantization; the former imposes no limit on the number of quantization bits, while the second only allows for one bit. In the presence of a uniform dithering signal and when measurement vectors are sub-gaussian, we show that the same algorithm (i.e., the G-Lasso) has favorable recovery guarantees for both uniform and one-bit quantization schemes. Our theoretical results, shed light on the appropriate choice of the range of values of the dithering signal and accurately capture the error dependence on the problem parameters. For example, our error analysis shows that the G-Lasso with one-bit uniformly dithered measurements leads to only a logarithmic rate loss compared to the full- precision measurements.",2018,"2018 56th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)"

Des approches statistiques classique (modele de Cox) et innovantes (Bayesian Lasso [BL] et Bayes A [BA], association mesuree en pourcentage) ont ete appliquees pour evaluer lâ€™association des variants avec le risque de recidive et de progression. La capacite discriminative des modeles a ete evaluee avec lâ€™index de concordance (c-index). Resultats Deux cent soixante-huit recidives et 76Â progression ont ete observees au cours dâ€™un suivi moyen de 82,7Â mois (2,5â€“117,6Â mois). RecidiveÂ : aucune association nâ€™a ete identifiee avec le Cox. Trois variants dans les genes TNIP1, CD5Â et JAK3Â ont montre une tres forte association avec le risque de recidive avec les methodes BL et BA (>Â 90Â %). ProgressionÂ : un variant dans le gene CD3G etait significativement associe au risque de progression avec la methode de Cox (HRÂ =Â 2,69Â ; p Â =Â 1,55Â Ã—Â 10 âˆ’5 ) et deux variants dans MASP1Â et AIRE etaient fortement associes en utilisant BA et BL (>Â 80Â %). Apres validation interne, lâ€™ajout des variants a augmente la capacite discriminative des variables cliniques de 58,4Â % a 60,5Â % et de 72,1Â % a 72,8Â % pour le risque de recidive et de progression respectivement. Conclusion Lâ€™utilisation de methodes statistiques innovantes a permis lâ€™identification dâ€™une association entre variants des genes de lâ€™inflammation et pronostic des TVNIM. Bien quâ€™une validation externe soit indispensable, lâ€™ajout des variants a permis dâ€™ameliorer la capacite discriminative des modeles cliniques.",2015,Progres En Urologie
Group LASSO for Structural Break Time Series,"Consider a structural break autoregressive (SBAR) process where j = 1, â€¦, m + 1, {t1, â€¦, tm} are change-points, 1 = t0 < t1 < â‹…â‹…â‹… < tm + 1 = n + 1, Ïƒ( Â· ) is a measurable function on , and {Ïµt} are white noise with unit variance. In practice, the number of change-points m is usually assumed to be known and small, because a large m would involve a huge amount of computational burden for parameters estimation. By reformulating the problem in a variable selection context, the group least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) is proposed to estimate an SBAR model when m is unknown. It is shown that both m and the locations of the change-points {t1, â€¦, tm} can be consistently estimated from the data, and the computation can be efficiently performed. An improved practical version that incorporates group LASSO and the stepwise regression variable selection technique are discussed. Simulation studies are conducted to assess the finite sample performance. Supplementary materials for this article are av...",2014,Journal of the American Statistical Association

An iterative contractive framework for probe methods: LASSO,"[1]Â We present a new iterative approach called Line Adaptation for the Singular Sources Objective (LASSO) to object or shape reconstruction based on the singular sources method (or probe method) for the reconstruction of scatterers from the far-field pattern of scattered acoustic or electromagnetic waves. The scheme is based on the construction of an indicator function given by the scattered field for incident point sources in its source point from the given far-field patterns for plane waves. The indicator function is then used to drive the contraction of a surface which surrounds the unknown scatterers. A stopping criterion for those parts of the surfaces that touch the unknown scatterers is formulated. A splitting approach for the contracting surfaces is formulated, such that scatterers consisting of several separate components can be reconstructed. Convergence of the scheme is shown, and its feasibility is demonstrated using a numerical study with several examples.",2011,Radio Science
Simultaneous variable selection for joint models of longitudinal and survival outcomes.,"Joint models of longitudinal and survival outcomes have been used with increasing frequency in clinical investigations. Correct specification of fixed and random effects is essential for practical data analysis. Simultaneous selection of variables in both longitudinal and survival components functions as a necessary safeguard against model misspecification. However, variable selection in such models has not been studied. No existing computational tools, to the best of our knowledge, have been made available to practitioners. In this article, we describe a penalized likelihood method with adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (ALASSO) penalty functions for simultaneous selection of fixed and random effects in joint models. To perform selection in variance components of random effects, we reparameterize the variance components using a Cholesky decomposition; in doing so, a penalty function of group shrinkage is introduced. To reduce the estimation bias resulted from penalization, we propose a two-stage selection procedure in which the magnitude of the bias is ameliorated in the second stage. The penalized likelihood is approximated by Gaussian quadrature and optimized by an EM algorithm. Simulation study showed excellent selection results in the first stage and small estimation biases in the second stage. To illustrate, we analyzed a longitudinally observed clinical marker and patient survival in a cohort of patients with heart failure.",2015,Biometrics
"Metals, Salt, and Slaves: Economic Links Between Gaul and Italy From the Eighth to the Late Sixth Centuries BC","Summary.Â  This paper discusses the role of metals, salt, textiles, and slaves in the development of networks of reciprocal exchange that interlinked the elites of Etruscan Italy and Early Iron Age Gaul between the eighth and sixth centuries BC. Maritime and transalpine contact are considered separately. Certain regional specialisms in Gaul are discussed: metals in the west and centre, supporting prosperous HaD elites around the rim of the Massif Central, salt on coasts and in the east, perhaps in exchange for Italian textiles, and slaves perhaps especially from the sixth-century BC Aisneâ€“Marne/Mont Lassois complex. A principal point is to establish the ubiquity and economic importance of women and children as domestic slaves both in Italy and Gaul and their consequent significance as valuable objects of elite exchange. Development in patterns of slave procurement during this period are considered.",2003,Oxford Journal of Archaeology

(1993)a classificationof imageregistrationmethodsis given accordingto a numberof discerningcriteria. Themaincriteriaare: Dimensionality (2D/3D/4D),natureof matchedproperties(extrinsic methodsusingartificial objects asstereotacticframes,heador dentalmolds,skinmarkers;andintrinsicmethodsus3.2Multimodality imageregistration 23 ing imagedataonly),elasticityof thetransformations(rigid/affine/projecti ve/curved), andinteraction(interacti ve/semi-automatic/automatic). This sectiondiscussesrigid registrationof multimodalvolumetricbrain images. In keepingwith thecategorization,theapproachesaredividedinto extrinsic andintrinsicmatching.Extrinsicregistrationmethodsaresubdi videdaccordingto thetype of artificialmarkeremployed,intrinsicmethodsaresubdi videdaccordingto thepropertyof theimagedatausedfor matching. 3.2.1 Extrinsic matching Thethreeapproachesclassifiedunderextrinsic matchinghave in commonthat they donotadmitof retrospecti vematching,whichentailsthattheclinical protocolsmust takeaccountof therequirementsof thematchingprocedures. Consequently , animage that was acquiredbeforethe necessityof multimodality integration is recognized, cannotbeincludedin thematchingprocedureif extrinsicapproachesareused. 3.2.1.1 Stereotacticframe / skull screws In stereotacticneurosur gery, a rigid frameis attachedto the headof the patientto guidethesurgical instruments.In theimageacquisitionstage,localizerframescontainingpoint markersor line markers(rods)areattachedto thesterotacticframein order to provide a referencesystemfor all imagingmodalities. Consequently , an accurateregistrationof all multimodalimagesfor surgery planningis ensured.We usethe terminologystereotacticframeexclusively for a framewhich is fixated to theskull by screws (Lunsford1988,Vandermeulen1991). Non-invasive moldsand adaptersaretreatedunderthenext heading.Stereotacticframebasedregistrationis theleastpatientfriendly of all imageintegrationapproaches. It hasa high degreeof reproducibility, andapplyingit is ratherlaborintensi ve. For a long time,stereotactic framebasedmatchinghasbeenthegold standardfor imageintegration. This holds no longertrue. Even thoughthe accuracy of stereotacticframebasedmethodscan be increasedby knowledgebasedmethods(Wanget al. 1994), thereis increasing evidencethatintrinsicmethodscanattainahigheraccuracy, while they arealsomore attracti veby any otherof thecriteriaused.This issuewill befurtherdiscussedbelow. 3.2.1.2 Non-invasively fixated mold or frame Non-invasively fixatedalternati vesto thestereotacticframeareathermoplasticmask (Schadet al. 1987), a dentalmold (Hawkes et al. 1992), a combinationof these (Greitz et al. 1980),andan adapterwith a nasionsupportandearplugs(Laitinen et al. 1985).

Non-invasive framesaresuitedprimarily for radiotherapy purposes(registrationof CT with treatmentbeams);they have little usein functional imaging,and thus in functional-anatomical imageintegration. 3.2.1.3 Skin markers Imageregistrationusingskinmarkersis patientfriendly andapplicableto all clinical imagingmodalities. The reproducibility is goodfor brief time intervals, in which casethereferencepointsof themarkerscanbemarkedwith (if necessary , invisible) ink; for long time intervals,thereproducibilityis at bestfair. Theaccuracy of point marker basedmatchingmaybequitegoodunderidealcircumstances, i.e., whenthe tomographicimageslicesarethin andinterslicegapsarenarrow or absent,andwhen the referencepointsare insidethe scannedvolume. The methodis not very labor intensi ve if thenumberof markersis limited to four or five (Lehmannet al. 1991). For imageprotocolswith thick slicesand/orlarge interslicegaps,the accuracy of pointmarker basedregistrationis poor. Arrow-shapedskinmarkerswereintroduced in VandenElsenetal. (1991)to combineEEGor MEG derived3D dipoledatawith tomographic(CT, MRI) imagedataof thesamepatient(seealsoFigure3.7). Subsequently , this typeof marker wasusedfor variousimage-to-imagematchingprocedures(Knufmanetal.1992,VandenElsenandViergever1994).Themainadvantage of arrow-shapedmarkersoverpoint-shapedmarkersis thatthey canbelocatedin tomographicimageswith subsliceaccuracy, which makesthemsuperiorespeciallyin matchingdatasetswith aninferior samplingin theaxial direction. Furthermore,the markerscanindicatepointsslightly outsidethescannedvolume. 3.2.2 Intrinsic matching The threemethodsclassifiedunderintrinsic matchinghave two propertiesin common. Thefirst is the retrospecti ve natureof thematch;the imagingprotocolsneed not make provisionsfor the matchingprocedure.The secondcommonpropertyis, accordingly, the extremepatientfriendlinessof the approaches.The key problem of intrinsic matchingmethodsis theselectionof the imagepropertieson which the matchis based.Thesehave to bederivedfrom quitedissimilarimages,which poses achallengingtask. 3.2.2.1 Anatomical landmarks Imageregistrationusinganatomicallandmarksis generallya ratherlabor intensi ve process,sincethe landmarkshave to be pointedout interacti vely (seee.g., (Evans etal. 1989,Schiersetal. 1989,Hill etal. 1991)).While afirst guessmaybeprovided by automaticmeans,no fully automatedlandmarkextractionalgorithmshave been 3.2Multimodality imageregistration 25 reported.Consequently , theapproachhasa low degreeof reproducibility. Theaccuracy is fair andincreaseswith thenumberof landmarksuseduntil a certainlimit is reached(typically at around20 25 landmarks(Timmens1991)).Landmarkmatching is applicableto all tomographicimagingmodalitiesandcanreadilybeextended to nonlinear(curved) matching. This latter propertyis sharedonly by voxel based methods. 3.2.2.2 Structures/ objects Object basedimagematchinghas becomepopularby the work of Pelizzari and coworkers(Chenet al. 1987,Pelizzariet al. 1989,Levin et al. 1989).

PÃºrpura trombocitopÃªnica idiopÃ¡tica e linfoma nÃ£o-Hodgkin de cÃ©lulas T na infÃ¢ncia,"Abstract Lymphomas represent 10% of all malignant tumors in childhoodand from these non-Hodgkin's lymphomas are the most frequent.Children who have autoimmune diseases have a higher probabilityof developing lymphoproliferative diseases, which can happenbefore, during or after the appearance of the neoplasia. Theassociation between idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura andlymphomas is not common (3%) especially in children. Twotheories try to explain the origin of this association. In the firstone, the thrombocytopenia would be a result of an autoantibodyanti-blood platelet production by the tumoral clone. In the secondone, the idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura would be a result ofa persistent antigenic stimulus subordinate to a disorder in thelymphoid proliferation. The aim of this work is to report the unusualassociation between idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in childhood. Rev. bras. hematol.hemoter. 2006; 28 (1):73-75.

Influence of marine reserves on reef fish recruitment in the upper Florida Keys,"Coral reef fish recruitment to the upper Florida Keys was monitored monthly for 7Â years (2003â€“2009) to establish a baseline and test whether recruitment varied between reserve and non-reserve sites. Recruits <30Â days old were surveyed in two primary habitat types (reef and rubble) in each of two replicate reserve and non-reserve sites. Recruitment of all fish species peaked in the summer and early fall; winter recruitment was consistently low. Some interannual recruitment patterns were roughly similar among species, with recruitment generally lower in 2004 for several taxa, possibly reflecting a system-wide process. During 7 peak recruitment months each year, overall recruitment to reef habitat was significantly higher in non-reserve sites in 2 of 7Â years. In contrast, recruitment to rubble habitat was significantly higher in reserves in 3 of 7Â years. Specific fish taxa had variable patterns of recruitment to reserves and non-reserves: Despite high interannual variation in recruitment magnitude, Scaridae (parrotfish) densities were significantly higher in reserves than in non-reserves. Densities of two abundant goby taxa (Gnatholepis thompsoni and Coryphopterus spp.) were also higher in reserves than in non-reserves, but the magnitude varied among years. Recruitment of the bicolor damselfish, Stegastes partitus, did not differ consistently between reserves and non-reserves. Densities of Thalassoma bifasciatum had an opposite trend relative to other taxa, with densities typically higher in non-reserves than in reserves (in 6 of 7Â years; significant in only 2Â years). Higher recruit densities (scarids, gobies, and all rubble taxa together) within reserves were coupled with significantly lower densities of intermediate-sized piscivores and significantly greater cover of Dictyota spp. macroalgae and turfs relative to non-reserves. Reserves may be areas of relative refuge from predation for some fish recruits due to a combination of reduced predator abundance and enhanced small-scale structural habitat.",2012,Coral Reefs
Seminal human immunodeficiency virus blips and structured natural conception in serodiscordant couples.,"TO THE EDITORâ€”As the prognosis for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)â€“ infected patients has improved with effective therapies, the prospect of raising children has become a realistic expectation among many serodiscordant couples. For seronegative women, structured natural conception can offer an appealing (and affordable) balance between getting pregnant and avoiding infection from their seropositive male partner. However, despite sustained long-term suppression of plasma viremia by antiretroviral therapy below the level of detection, some HIV-infected men intermittently and unpredictably have detectable free or cell-associated HIV in their semen, independent of drug regimen or seminal drug levels [1â€“4]. Shedding has been associated with transient increases in T-cell activation confined to the male genital tract [4â€“6]. The finite (albeit quite small) possibility of infecting a seronegative partner during intercourse even when the seropositive patient has plasma virus fully suppressed looms over structured natural conception initiatives for discordant heterosexual couples wanting offspring [1, 7, 8]. Unfortunately, an absolute zero risk for a coital act seems theoretically unattainable, given the limitations of current interventions, since elimination of cellassociated HIV is not yet achievable [9]. Integrated proviral DNA lies dormant in compartmentalized cellular reservoirs, prominently including the neurological and genitourinary compartments. When HIV-harboring cells within a compartment are stimulated, site-specific viral blips occur irrespective of systemic events in blood and elsewhere. Restricted by their specific mechanism of action, drugs targeting isolated intracellular steps in the preintegration viral life cycle cannot interfere with release of virus during the first ensuing cycle after activation [10]. Even when pregnancy is the goal, unprotected intercourse should be avoided in the presence of recognized sexually transmitted diseases or other genitourinary infections; however, self-limited productive HIV infection is likely more often triggered by subclinical and, thus, unsuspected inflammation (such as asymptomatic shedding of herpesviruses) [5, 6, 11, 12]. The very small residual risk of HIV transmission associated with structured natural conception may be acceptable to qualifying and well-informed couples (especially when other options are unavailable or impractical), but the ultimate decision maker must always be the unharassed female partner [13â€“15].",2013,The Journal of infectious diseases
"Ã‰volution de lâ€™Ã©tat nutritionnel et des troubles de la dÃ©glutition au cours des accidents vasculaires cÃ©rÃ©braux, en milieu hospitalier au Burkina Faso","Le Burkina Faso (BF) connait les phenomenes de transitions nutritionnelle et epidemiologique. Les hospitalisations pour AVC ou pour HTA et diabete sont en augmentation progressive, atteignant en 2016 trois fois les valeurs de 2012. Pour reduire la morbi-mortalite liee aux AVC, il faut reduire lâ€™incidence des troubles de la deglutition (TD) et la denutrition liee a la maladie. Les donnees sur ces sujets sont rares ou absentes en Afrique subsaharienne et au BF. Les objectifs des travaux etaient de i) determiner la prevalence des troubles nutritionnels et des TD a lâ€™admission pour AVC au BF, ainsi que leur evolution dans les 14 premiers jours de suivi ii) explorer au premier niveau de soins les connaissances et attitudes des infirmiers concernant les TD et les troubles nutritionnels des patients hemiplegiques, potentiellement victimes dâ€™AVC. Lâ€™etat nutritionnel et les TD de 222 patients victimes dâ€™AVC consecutivement admis aux CHU de Ouagadougou et de Bobo-Dioulasso etaient etudies a lâ€™inclusion J0, au 8eme jour J8, et au 14eme jour J14. Les prevalences de la denutrition etaient respectivement de 25,2%, 29,4% et 31,0%, et celles des TD de 37,4%, 28,4% et 15,8%. Tous les criteres anthropometriques baissaient entre J0 et J14. A J14, les facteurs associes a la presence dâ€™une denutrition etaient le sexe feminin (OR=7,01; IC95% :1,51-32,56), le faible poids a J0 (OR=0,69; IC95%: 0,60- 0,79), et le faible pli cutane tricipital tricipital a J0 (OR=0,85; IC95%: 0,74-0,99). La denutrition etait un probleme de sante important des J0 chez ces patients, et les personnes de sexe feminin et les patients les plus denutries a J0 devraient etre particulierement surveillees et pris en charge. Un questionnaire dâ€™exploration des connaissances et pratiques concernant les TD et les troubles nutritionnels etait administre a 125 infirmiers de centres de soins primaires urbains travaillant dans les centres dont le niveau de reference recoit le plus de patients hemiplegiques au BF. 57% des infirmiers avaient des connaissances modestes sur le role du cerveau dans le controle de la deglutition et la survenue dâ€™une hemiplegie. Concernant le depistage des TD, 58,4% donnaient de bonnes reponses sur le chapitre portant sur la toux et 56,0% sur le chapitre portant sur la voix. 42,3% des infirmiers faisaient le lien entre pneumopathie dâ€™inhalation et TD, 36,0% connaissaient une manoeuvre dâ€™urgence a appliquer en cas de fausse route tracheale. Seulement 1,6% des infirmiers savaient que les adaptations des textures, les modifications de gout ou de temperature des boissons pouvaient influer sur les TD, et 65,6% reconnaissaient lâ€™impact des adaptations posturales. Lâ€™impact des TD sur lâ€™etat nutritionnel etaient connu par 39,2% des infirmiers. Pour depister un TD, seulement 11,6% des infirmiers utilisaient a la fois un interrogatoire et un test de realimentation. 30,1% des infirmiers ne prodiguaient pas de conseils hygieno-dietetiques aux patients. Lors du transfert du malade vers lâ€™echelon superieur, 41,7% ne renseignaient jamais lâ€™existence ou non des TD. En multivarie, seule la bonne connaissance du chapitre voix etait associee a la capacite de detecter un TD (OR=3,5; IC95%: 1,4-8,1). Les elements du cursus professionnel des infirmiers nâ€™intervenaient pas. Lâ€™enseignement de neurologie et celui portant sur la nutrition des patients hemiplegiques devrait integrer des donnees specifiques sur les TD, avec en particulier leurs modalites de depistage et des conseils simples de textures et de postures. Ces etudes ont permis de preciser pour la premiere fois lâ€™etat nutritionnel et la prevalence des TD chez les patients post-AVC au BF. Elles suggerent que les parcours de soins des patients pourraient etre securises, grÃ¢ce en particulier a la mise en place de programmes de formations des personnels de sante, a une meilleure information des patients, quand câ€™est possible, et des entourages, et egalement a la mise a disposition de materiels et techniques simples.",2017,
Identification of axiomatic relations from unstructured texts using named entity recognition,"Domain ontologies facilitate the organization, sharing and reuse of domain knowledge. The construction of ontologies from text deals with the extraction of concepts and relations from a text collection. A huge challenge is the learning of more expressive ontologies which includes relations such as disjointness or equivalence between classes. In this paper, we propose a method for recognition of named entities, which operates on the levels of instance and class. Firstly, at the instance level, using a named entity recognition tool named entities from unstructured texts are extracted. In addition, the type and subtype of the extracted named entity are identified. Secondly, at the class level, for each class a set of instances that allow characterizing the class is associated. Then, using the type and the set of instances of each class, the proposed method can identify the axiomatic relation. The different axiomatic relations that approach identifies can be subClassOf, disjointWith, and equivalentClass. The evaluation of the method for named entity recognition proposed was performed using a data set of 3542 English text documents.",2017,Polibits
Fast and accurate detection of evolutionary shifts in Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck models,"Summary 
 
The detection of evolutionary shifts in trait evolution from extant taxa is motivated by the study of convergent evolution, or to correlate shifts in traits with habitat changes or with changes in other phenotypes. 
We propose here a phylogenetic lasso method to study trait evolution from comparative data and detect past changes in the expected mean trait values. We use the Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck process, which can model a changing adaptive landscape over time and over lineages. 
Our method is very fast, running in minutes for hundreds of species, and can handle multiple traits. We also propose a phylogenetic Bayesian information criterion that accounts for the phylogenetic correlation between species, as well as for the complexity of estimating an unknown number of shifts at unknown locations in the phylogeny. This criterion does not suffer model overfitting and has high precision, so it offers a conservative alternative to other information criteria. 
Our re-analysis of Anolis lizard data suggests a more conservative scenario of morphological adaptation and convergence than previously proposed. Software is available on GitHub.",2016,Methods in Ecology and Evolution
Synergistic effect of nanoparticles and Thalassospira sp. isolated from Bahregan area in biodegradation of oil sludge,"ABSTRACTOil sludge is obtained from the contaminated site of Bahregan area in the Persian Gulf in Iran. Chemotaxis was used for the isolation of alkane-degrading bacteria from oil sludge and the alk genes were determined with specific primers. bac1 identified in Thalassospira was selected as a powerful strain for biodegradation of oil sludge. Biodegradation of oil sludge by bac1 in the presence of nanoparticles was investigated by GC-MS analysis. Synergistic effect of Fe2O3 and Fe3O4 nanoparticles on bacteria increases the biodegradation of oil sludge and produces cyclosiloxane compound which is used in the field of medicine; however, the Thalassospira reduced its toxicity in the environment.",2017,Petroleum Science and Technology
Characterization of Telemedicine Use Among US Emergency Departments: 3EMF,"Study Objectives: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is strongly associated with adverse clinical outcomes including prolonged hospitalization, progression to CKD, and death. Diagnosis of AKI relies on detection of changes in serum creatinine (sCr) and urine output, both of which lag days behind renal injury and are unreliable at initial presentation. Here, we utilized data mining and machine learning methods to develop a predictive model for AKI with capacity for identifying ED patients at high risk for development of AKI within 7 days of their ED visit. Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional cohort of ED visits from 3 hospitals over 2 years was generated and used for model derivation and out-of-sample validation. Clinical data for all adult ED visits where initial sCr measurements were available at index visit and again within 7 days of EDdeparturewere extracted froma relational database that underlies our electronic health record (EHR) by an experienced data user. Primary outcome for prediction was Stage 2 AKI within 7 days of ED visit, defined according to sCr-based Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria (sCr increase to 2 times baseline). Secondary outcomes included KDIGO Stage 1 AKI (sCr increase of 0.3mg/dl above baseline or 1.5 times baseline) and Stage 3 AKI (sCr increase to 3 times baseline or to 4.0 mg/dl). Predictor variables extracted from the EHR included vital signs, laboratory results, chief complaints, demographics, past medical history, active problems, home medications and EDmedication administrations. Only EHR data available prior to prediction, made at time of first metabolic panel result, was included. Predictor variables were normalized as follows: ED vital signs and laboratory results were processed to minimum and maximum values, nephrotoxic and nephroprotective medications were grouped by pharmacologic class and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) feature selection processing applied to chief complaints and active problems identify variables with predictive value for AKI.Multiple machine learning models (logistic regression, decision tree, linear discriminant analysis, support vector machine, and random forest) were generated and tested in the prediction of our primary outcome. All were developed using a training dataset comprised of 90% of encounters and evaluated in the remaining encounters using 10-fold cross validation. Performance of each model was assessed using binary classification measures and receiver operator curve (ROC) analyses. Results: Our final cohort included 127,183 ED visits by 72,539 unique patients. Median age was 58 years (IQR: 43-71) and most common high-risk comorbidities were hypertension (51.8%) and heart failure (9.8%). Incidence of AKI in our cohort was as follows: Stage 1: 12.4%, Stage 2: 1.5%, Stage 3: 1.0%. Predictive model performance as measured by area under the ROC analysis ranged from 0.661 (95% CI: 0.637 0.685) using decision tree to 0.771 (95% CI: 0.759 0.783) using random forest. Conclusions: Machine learning methods applied to EHR data identified ED patients at high risk for AKI well before patients met diagnostic criteria. The model developed here, when paired with nephroprotective point-of-care clinical decision support, has potential to improve outcomes for this patient population.",2018,Annals of Emergency Medicine
Bayesian model selection in logistic regression for the detection of adverse drug reactions.,"Spontaneous adverse event reports have a high potential for detecting adverse drug reactions. However, due to their dimension, the analysis of such databases requires statistical methods. In this context, disproportionality measures can be used. Their main idea is to project the data onto contingency tables in order to measure the strength of associations between drugs and adverse events. However, due to the data projection, these methods are sensitive to the problem of coprescriptions and masking effects. Recently, logistic regressions have been used with a Lasso type penalty to perform the detection of associations between drugs and adverse events. On different examples, this approach limits the drawbacks of the disproportionality methods, but the choice of the penalty value is open to criticism while it strongly influences the results. In this paper, we propose to use a logistic regression whose sparsity is viewed as a model selection challenge. Since the model space is huge, a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm carries out the model selection by maximizing the BIC criterion. Thus, we avoid the calibration of penalty or threshold. During our application on the French pharmacovigilance database, the proposed method is compared to well-established approaches on a reference dataset, and obtains better rates of positive and negative controls. However, many signals (i.e., specific drug-event associations) are not detected by the proposed method. So, we conclude that this method should be used in parallel to existing measures in pharmacovigilance. Code implementing the proposed method is available at the following url: https://github.com/masedki/MHTrajectoryR.",2016,Biometrical journal. Biometrische Zeitschrift
Recovery of Structured Signals From Corrupted Non-Linear Measurements,"This paper studies the problem of recovering a structured signal from a relatively small number of corrupted non-linear measurements. Assuming that signal and corruption are contained in some structure-promoted set, we suggest an extended Lasso to disentangle signal and corruption. We also provide conditions under which this recovery procedure can successfully reconstruct both signal and corruption.",2019,2019 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)
Machine-learning and Statistical Subgroup Analyses of Vasopressor Choice for the Treatment of Non-traumatic Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Using Electronic Health Records,"Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a life-threatening stroke caused by bleeding in the subarachnoid space. Delayed cerebral ischemia, a risk factor for death during non-traumatic SAH treatment, is often prevented by inducing hemodynamic augmentation through the administration of vasopressors. The three common vasopressors administrated to SAH patients are dopamine, phenylephrine, and norepinephrine. A recent study using Electronic Health Records (EHR) of nontraumatic SAH patients identified that the administration of phenylephrine is associated with lower hospital mortality; however, this study did not consider heterogeneity in treatment effects. Therefore, the goal of this paper is to study the heterogeneity in vasopressor treatment effects by exploratory subgroup analyses. The subgroups were identified by studying the vasopressor and pretreatment covariates interaction effects. We employed a machine learning and a generalized linear model approach to study the interaction effects. We also employed propensity scoring and inverse probability weighting to minimize the confounding and selection biases in treatment effect estimates due to inherent pretreatment group differences in the data. Our results showed that dopamine had the highest mortality among those who did not have ondansetron ( a pretreatment medication used to prevent nausea) compared to phenylephrine and norepinephrine; whereas norepinephrine has the highest mortality among those who had ondansetron compared to phenylephrine and dopamine. However, for the subgroup who did not have ondansetron but had fentanyl and lidocaine, there was no significant difference in the mortality rate between vasopressor treatment group. Overall, those who had ondansetron had better survival compared to those who did not have ondansetron with respect to all the three vasopressors.

Blind identification of sparse dynamic networks and applications,"This paper considers the problem of identifying the topology of a sparsely interconnected network of dynamical systems from experimental noisy data. Specifically, we assume that the observed data was generated by an underlying, unknown graph topology where each node corresponds to a given time-series and each link to an unknown autoregressive model that maps those time series. The goal is to recover the sparsest (in the sense of having the fewest number of links) structure compatible with some a-priori information and capable of explaining the observed data. Contrary to related existing work, our framework allows for (unmeasurable) exogenous inputs, intended to model relatively infrequent events such as environmental or set-point changes in the underlying processes. The main result of the paper shows that both the network topology and the unknown inputs can be identified by solving a convex optimization problem, obtained by combining Group-Lasso type arguments with a re-weighted heuristics. As shown here, this combination leads to substantially sparser topologies than using either group Lasso or orthogonal decomposition based algorithms. These results are illustrated using both academic examples and several non-trivial problems drawn from multiple application domains that include finances, biology and computer vision.",2011,IEEE Conference on Decision and Control and European Control Conference
LASSO based stimulus frequency recognition model for SSVEP BCIs,"Abstract Steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) has been increasingly used for the study of brainâ€“computer interface (BCI). How to recognize SSVEP with shorter time and lower error rate is one of the key points to develop a more efficient SSVEP-based BCI. To achieve this goal, we make use of the sparsity constraint of the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) for the extraction of more discriminative features of SSVEP, and then we propose a LASSO model using the linear regression between electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings and the standard square-wave signals of different frequencies to recognize SSVEP without the training stage. In this study, we verified the proposed LASSO model offline with the EEG data of nine healthy subjects in contrast to canonical correlation analysis (CCA). In the experiment, when a shorter time window was used, we found that the LASSO model yielded better performance in extracting robust and detectable features of SSVEP, and the information transfer rate obtained by the LASSO model was significantly higher than that of the CCA. Our proposed method can assist to reduce the recording time without sacrificing the classification accuracy and is promising for a high-speed SSVEP-based BCI.",2012,Biomed. Signal Process. Control.

Genetics and population analysis EBglmnet : a comprehensive R package for sparse generalized linear regression models Anhui,"Summary: EBglmnet is an R package implementing empirical Bayesian method with both lasso (EBlasso) and elastic net (EBEN) priors for generalized linear models. In our previous studies, both EBlasso and EBEN outperformed other state-of-the-art methods such as lasso and elastic net in inferring sparse genotype and phenotype associations, in which the number of covariates is typically much larger than the sample size. While high density genetic markers can be easily obtained nowadays in genetics and population analysis thanks to the advancements in molecular high throughput technologies, EBglmnet will be a very useful tool for statistical modeling in this area.

Detecting genetic associations with brain imaging phenotypes in Alzheimer's disease via a novel structured SCCA approach,"Brain imaging genetics becomes an important research topic since it can reveal complex associations between genetic factors and the structures or functions of the human brain. Sparse canonical correlation analysis (SCCA) is a popular bi-multivariate association identification method. To mine the complex genetic basis of brain imaging phenotypes, there arise many SCCA methods with a variety of norms for incorporating different structures of interest. They often use the group lasso penalty, the fused lasso or the graph/network guided fused lasso ones. However, the group lasso methods have limited capability because of the incomplete or unavailable prior knowledge in real applications. The fused lasso and graph/network guided methods are sensitive to the sign of the sample correlation which may be incorrectly estimated. In this paper, we introduce two new penalties to improve the fused lasso and the graph/network guided lasso penalties in structured sparse learning. We impose both penalties to the SCCA model and propose an optimization algorithm to solve it. The proposed SCCA method has a strong upper bound of grouping effects for both positively and negatively highly correlated variables. We show that, on both synthetic and real neuroimaging genetics data, the proposed SCCA method performs better than or equally to the conventional methods using fused lasso or graph/network guided fused lasso. In particular, the proposed method identifies higher canonical correlation coefficients and captures clearer canonical weight patterns, demonstrating its promising capability in revealing biologically meaningful imaging genetic associations.",2020,Medical image analysis

Improved nearest neighbor classifiers by weighting and selection of predictors,"Nearest neighborhood classification is a flexible classification method that works under weak assumptions. The basic concept is to use the weighted or un-weighted sums over class indicators of observations in the neighborhood of the target value. Two modifications that improve the performance are considered here. Firstly, instead of using weights that are solely determined by the distances we estimate the weights by use of a logit model. By using a selection procedure like lasso or boosting the relevant nearest neighbors are automatically selected. Based on the concept of estimation and selection, in the second step, we extend the predictor space. We include nearest neighborhood counts, but also the original predictors themselves and nearest neighborhood counts that use distances in sub dimensions of the predictor space. The resulting classifiers combine the strength of nearest neighbor methods with parametric approaches and by use of sub dimensions are able to select the relevant features. Simulations and real data sets demonstrate that the method yields better misclassification rates than currently available nearest neighborhood methods and is a strong and flexible competitor in classification problems.",2016,Statistics and Computing
From Trade Reciprocity to Alliance Debts: Anti-Oedipus and Political Economy in â€œPrimitiveâ€ Societies,"The aim of the present article is to pinpoint the issues involved in the analysis of the economy of â€œprimitiveâ€ societies, as carried out by Deleuze and Guattari in Anti-Oedipus. To do so it focuses on a logic of debt (Nietzsche) rather than on a logic of reciprocity (Levi-Strauss). Deleuze and Guattariâ€™s critical discussion of Levi-Straussâ€™s ethnology can thus be related to the problematization of kinship, understood as a system of alliance and filiation relationships, which is formulated within French Marxist anthropology (E. Terray, C. Meillassoux) on the one hand, and Edmund Leachâ€™s critical anthropology on the other. This double mediation helps to show that in Anti-Oedipus, what Deleuze and Guattari seek to identify are the political strategies at work in economic relations. In the present instance, this means the finite alliance strategies operating in â€œprimitiveâ€ societies and which are deeper than trade and production relationships.",2012,Actuel Marx
Impressions of a Middle Grades STEM Integration Program,"Educators share lessons learned from the implementation of a middle grades STEM curriculum model. Our ever-changing, increasingly global society faces many problems that are multidisciplinary, and solving them requires the integration and application of multiple science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) concepts and skills. Yet, science and mathematics, too often, are taught as isolated subjects in school, and too few students choose to pursue studies in STEM disciplines (Chen & Weko, 2009; Farmer, 2009; Laird, Alt, & Wu, 2009; Lips & McNeill, 2009; Moore, 2007; National Science Board [NSB], 2007). Moreover, there is alarming evidence that U.S. students are receiving insufficient academic preparation in STEM education (Farmer, 2009; Laird, Alt, & Wu, 2009; Lips & McNeill, 2009; NSB, 2007; Starkman, 2007). National test scores suggest that many students in the United States finish the middle grades underprepared in STEM subjects. For example, on the 2005 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) science test, 41% of eighth graders scored below basic level (National Center for Educational Statistics [NCES], 2006), and 29% of eighth graders scored below basic on the 2007 NAEP mathematics test (NCES, 2007). The National Science Board's (NSB) national action plan for STEM echoes these concerns: The United States possesses the most innovative, technologically capable economy in the world, and yet its science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education system is failing to ensure that all American students receive the skills and knowledge required for success in the 21st century workforce."" (NSB, 2007, p. 1) What can be done to help increase the number of adequately prepared students entering STEM fields? Recent efforts have focused on developing highquality STEM education, such as the National Science Foundation's Mathematics Science Technology Partnership (MSTP) project or widening and strengthening the STEM pathways from primary through postsecondary education (Chen & Weko, 2009; National Academy of Science, 2007). One way to increase student interest, engagement, and achievement in STEM disciplines may be through a more realistic, integrated approach to learning. Interdisciplinary or integrated education is ""a holistic approach that links the disciplines so that the learning becomes connected, focused, meaningful, and relevant to learners"" (Smith & Karr-Kidwell, 2000, p. 22). Integrated STEM education can thus be understood as interdisciplinary education that seeks to combine science, technology, engineering, and mathematics in one course. While integrated curriculum is not a new idea, integrated STEM curriculum is relatively new, and there is a need for research to improve and describe the impact of integrated STEM education curricula. This article describes the experiences of one Minnesota middle school that implemented a yearlong integrated STEM program with the cooperation of graduate student fellows from a local university. The authors, two of whom were among the graduate students involved in the project, describe their impressions of the program, share some lessons they and their schoolbased partners learned along the way, and offer some implications and recommendations for other schools considering STEM programs. Integrated curriculum and STEM Integrated curriculum has long been recommended at the middle level (National Middle School Association, 2010), as such an approach ""provides opportunities for more relevant, less fragmented, and more stimulating experiences for learners"" (Furner & Kumar, 2007, p. 186). However, a common and explicit understanding of integration continues to be a significant obstacle to effective implementation (Berlin & White, 1995; Frykholm & Glasson, 2005; Stinson, Harkness, Meyer, & Stallworth, 2009). For example, many terms in the literature refer to integration, such as cross-disciplinary, interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary, and fused (e. â€¦",2011,Middle School Journal

Feature-specific inference for penalized regression using local false discovery rates,"Penalized regression methods, most notably the lasso, are a popular approach to analyzing high-dimensional data. An attractive property of the lasso is that it naturally performs variable selection. An important area of concern, however, is the reliability of these variable selections. Motivated by local false discovery rate methodology from the large-scale hypothesis testing literature, we propose a method for calculating a local false discovery rate for each variable under consideration by the lasso model. These rates can be used to assess the reliability of an individual feature, or to estimate the model's overall false discovery rate. The method can be used for all values of $\lambda$. This is particularly useful for models with a few highly significant features but a high overall Fdr, which are a relatively common occurrence when using cross validation to select $\lambda$. It is also flexible enough to be applied to many varieties of penalized likelihoods including GLM and Cox models, and a variety of penalties, including MCP and SCAD. We demonstrate the validity of this approach and contrast it with other inferential methods for penalized regression as well as with local false discovery rates for univariate hypothesis tests. Finally, we show the practical utility of our method by applying it to two case studies involving high dimensional genetic data.",2018,arXiv: Methodology
Urinary Tract Infection among Pregnant Women at Bobo-dioulasso : Epidemiological and Bacteriological Aspects,"Urinary tract infections are the first infections in pregnant women and can cause serious complications during pregnancy.

Development of a recommender system for dental care using machine learning,"Resource mismanagement along with the underutilization of dental care has led to serious health and economic consequences. Artificial intelligence was applied to a national health database to develop recommendations for dental care. The data were obtained from the 2013â€“2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey to perform machine learning. Feature selection was done using LASSO in R to determine the best regression model. Prediction models were developed using several supervised machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest, and classification and regression tree. Feature selection by LASSO along with the inclusion of additional clinically relevant variables identified 8 top features associated with recommendation for dental care. The top 3 features include gum health, number of prescription medications taken, and race. Gum health shows a significantly higher relative importance compared to other features. Demographics, healthcare access, and general health variables were identified as top features related to receiving additional dental care, consistent with prior research. Practicing dentists and other healthcare professionals can follow this model to enable precision dentistry through the incorporation of our algorithms into computerized screening tool or decision tree diagram to achieve more efficient and personalized preventive strategies and treatment protocols in dental care.",2019,SN Applied Sciences

Towards this end, we performed an untargeted metabolomic analysis of breast ductal fluid using an ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a quadrupole time-of-light (UPLC-QTOF) mass spectrometer. We investigated the metabolomic profiles of breast tumors using ductal fluid samples collected by ductal lavage (DL). We studied fluid from both the affected breasts and the unaffected contralateral breasts (as controls) from 43 women with confirmed unilateral breast cancer. Using this approach, we identified 1560 ions in the positive mode and 538 ions in the negative mode after preprocessing of the UPLCâ€‘QTOF data. Paired t-tests applied on these data matrices identified 209 ions (positive and negative modes combined) with significant change in intensity level between affected and unaffected control breasts (adjusted p-values <0.05). Among these, 83 ions (39.7%) showed a fold change (FC) >1.2 and 66 ions (31.6%) were identified with putative compound names. The metabolites that we identified included endogenous metabolites such as amino acid derivatives (N-Acetyl-DL-tryptophan) or products of lipid metabolism such as N-linoleoyl taurine, trans-2-dodecenoylcarnitine, lysophosphatidylcholine LysoPC(18:2(9Z,12Z)), glycerophospholipids PG(18:0/0:0), and phosphatidylserine PS(20:4(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z). Generalized LASSO regression further selected 21 metabolites when race, menopausal status, smoking, grade and TNM stage were adjusted for. A predictive conditional logistic regression model, using the LASSO selected 21 ions, provided diagnostic accuracy with the area under the curve of 0.956 (sensitivity/specificity of 0.907/0.884). This is the first study that shows the feasibility of conducting a comprehensive metabolomic profiling of breast tumors using breast ductal fluid to detect changes in the cellular microenvironment of the tumors and shows the potential for this approach to be used to improve detection of breast cancer.",2016,International Journal of Oncology
Diffusion Indexes with Sparse Loadings,"The use of large-dimensional factor models in forecasting has received much attention in the literature with the consensus being that improvements on forecasts can be achieved when comparing with standard models. However, recent contributions in the literature have demonstrated that care needs to be taken when choosing which variables to include in the model. A number of different approaches to determining these variables have been put forward. These are, however, often based on ad-hoc procedures or abandon the underlying theoretical factormodel. In this paper we will take a different approach to the problem by using the LASSO as a variable selection method to choose between the possible variables and thus obtain sparse loadings from which factors or diffusion indexes can be formed. This allows us to build a more parsimonious factor model which is better suited for forecasting compared to the traditional principal components (PC) approach.We provide an asymptotic analysis of the estimator and illustrate its merits empirically in a forecasting experiment based on US macroeconomic data. Overall we find that compared to PC we obtain improvements in forecasting accuracy and thus find it to be an important alternative to PC.",2013,
