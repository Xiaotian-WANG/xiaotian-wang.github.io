Identifying prognostic intratumor heterogeneity using pre- and post-radiotherapy 18F-FDG PET images for pancreatic cancer patients.,"BACKGROUND
To stratify risks of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PA) patients using pre- and post-radiotherapy (RT) PET/CT images, and to assess the prognostic value of texture variations in predicting therapy response of patients.


METHODS
Twenty-six PA patients treated with RT from 2011-2013 with pre- and post-treatment 18F-FDG-PET/CT scans were identified. Tumor locoregional texture was calculated using 3D kernel-based approach, and texture variations were identified by fitting discrepancies of texture maps of pre- and post-treatment images. A total of 48 texture and clinical variables were identified and evaluated for association with overall survival (OS). The prognostic heterogeneity features were selected using lasso/elastic net regression, and further were evaluated by multivariate Cox analysis.


RESULTS
Median age was 69 y (range, 46-86 y). The texture map and temporal variations between pre- and post-treatment were well characterized by histograms and statistical fitting. The lasso analysis identified seven predictors (age, node stage, post-RT SUVmax, variations of homogeneity, variance, sum mean, and cluster tendency). The multivariate Cox analysis identified five significant variables: age, node stage, variations of homogeneity, variance, and cluster tendency (with P=0.020, 0.040, 0.065, 0.078, and 0.081, respectively). The patients were stratified into two groups based on the risk score of multivariate analysis with log-rank P=0.001: a low risk group (n=11) with a longer mean OS (29.3 months) and higher texture variation (>30%), and a high risk group (n=15) with a shorter mean OS (17.7 months) and lower texture variation (<15%).


CONCLUSIONS
Locoregional metabolic texture response provides a feasible approach for evaluating and predicting clinical outcomes following treatment of PA with RT. The proposed method can be used to stratify patient risk and help select appropriate treatment strategies for individual patients toward implementing response-driven adaptive RT.",2017,Journal of gastrointestinal oncology
Feature Selection for Neural Networks Using Group Lasso Regularization,"We propose an embedded/integrated feature selection method based on neural networks with Group Lasso penalty. Group Lasso regularization is considered to produce sparsity on the inputs to the network, i.e., for selection of useful features. Lasso based feature selection using a multi-layer perceptron usually requires an additional set of weights, while our Group Lasso formulation does not require that. However, Group Lasso penalty is non-differentiable at the origin. This may lead to oscillations in numerical simulations and make it difficult to analyze theoretically. To address this issue, four smoothing Group Lasso penalties are introduced. A rigorous proof for the convergence of the proposed algorithm is presented under suitable assumptions. To verify the effectiveness, a three-step algorithmic architecture is adopted in implementation. Experimental results on several datasets validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the competitive performance of the proposed method.",2020,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering
Roman trade relationships at Sagalassos (Turkey) elucidated by ancient DNA of fish remains,"The excavations of Roman and Early Byzantine contexts at the town of Sagalassos (Turkey) yielded fish remains belonging to species that do not occur near the site. The modern geographical distribution of the identified fish indicates trade with various regions of Anatolia, the Mediterranean coast, Egypt and/or the Levant. Trade with Levant and Egypt is evident throughout the period by the presence of Clarias, a catfish living amongst others in the Nile and Levant. Mitochondrial DNA analysis was successfully carried out on modern populations of this species from Turkey, Syria, Israel and Egypt. Several variable regions were discovered on the mitochondrial control region containing polymorphisms that distinguish the haplotypes. Primer sets were designed to amplify small fragments of ancient DNA containing these informative regions. Ancient fish DNA could be successfully extracted, amplified and sequenced. The analyses indicate that the catfish bones belong to Clarias gariepinus and that they originated from the lower Nile. In addition, this study sheds light on the understanding of the modern distribution of C. gariepinus in Anatolia.",2003,Journal of Archaeological Science
[Predictive mortality factors and the development of major complications in non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage].,"Our aim was to analyze death prognostic factors in the first six months or the development of major neurological complications (delayed brain ischaemia and rebleeding) or general complications (cardiorespiratory, hydroelectrolytic or infectious) in non-traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage. We carried out an observational study of a historical cohort of 111 patients admitted consecutively to our Centre between 1986 and 1992 and who were diagnosed as having subarachnoid haemorrhage based upon clinical data and confirmed in all cases by brain computerized tomography (CT) scan and/or lumbar puncture. Clinical variables upon admission were collected prospectively and radiological data were obtained retrospectively. We performed a logistic regression analysis which showed as significant predictive variables for death in the first six months a score on the Hunt-Hess scale greater than 2, a score on the Glassow scale of less than 9, female, aged over 50 and rebleeding. As predictive factors for delayed brain ischaemia we identified the female sex and the existence of earlier general complications. In the development of rebleeding a significant predictive factor was high blood pressure antecedents although this may have been controlled upon admission. For the appearance of general complications, significant predictive factors were more than 2 on the Hunt-Hess scale and hypertension antecedents. The use of these predictive parameters may help evaluate a prognosis in subarachnoid haemorrhage patients and also help make decisions in the management of this pathology.",1996,Revista de neurologia
Least Squares Estimation in High Dimensional Sparse Heteroscedastic Models,"This contribution gives a brief review on penalized least squares methods in sparse linear regression models with a specific focus on heteroscedastic data structures. We discuss the well known bridge estimators, Lasso and adaptive Lasso and a new class of weighted penalized least squares methods, which address the problem of heteroscedasticity. We give a careful explanation on how the choice of the regularizing parameter affects the quality of the statistical inference (such as conservative or consistent model selection). The new estimators are asymptotically (pointwise) as efficient as estimators which are assisted by a model selection oracle. The results are illustrated by means of a small simulation study and the analysis of a data example.",2013,

Late Aptian (Cretaceous) climate changes in northeastern Brazil: A reconstruction based on indicator species analysis (IndVal),"Abstract The flora preserved in upper Aptian rocks of South America and Africa is typical of warm climate conditions and commonly associated with semi-arid to arid climate. Warmth-loving conifers of the family Cheirolepidiaceae and their pollen Classopollis are recorded in upper Aptian rocks in most of the South Atlantic margin basins. However, an increase in indicators of humid conditions (e.g., ferns) is recorded in most sedimentary basins of Brazil. The method of indicator species analysis (IndVal) was applied as a tool for reconstructing the vegetation during the late Aptian. The IndVal index expresses which taxa are strongly associated with particular groups of samples. The vegetation reflects climate changes, and the IndVal indices illustrate how the taxa interacted through time and reveal patterns in the changing composition of the vegetation. The material studied derives from two well sections drilled through the Riachuelo Formation in the Sergipe Basin, GTP-17-SE (Angico Member, 70 samples) and GTP-24-SE (Taquari Member, 108 samples). The indicator species are strongly associated with particular stratigraphic intervals. IndVal indices for the Angico section indicate seven taxa associated with four intervals, viz. Classopollis classoides (Interval AS-1); Callialasporites segmentatus and Cicatricosisporites avnimelechi (Interval AS-2); Verrucosisporites spp. and Cicatricosisporites microstriatus (Interval AS-3); Araucariacites australis and Cyathidites spp. (Interval AS-4). Values for the Taquari section indicate nine taxa associated with four intervals, viz. Classopollis classoides (Interval TS-1); Uesuguipollenites callosus, Callialasporites segmentatus Bennettitaepollenites regaliae, Cyathidites spp., Cicatricosisporites spp. and Araucariacites australis (Interval TS-2); Retitriletes spp. (Interval TS-3); Araucariacites australis and Verrucosisporites spp. (Interval TS-4). Two phases, dry and wet, are recognized in both sections. The dry phase is characterized by high to very high abundance of Classopollis classoides. A conspicuous change in vegetation is recorded, with an increase in ferns and upland flora, in particular Araucariacites australis. A. australis is the second most abundant terrestrial palynomorph. In the late Aptian of South America and Africa Araucariacites is generally associated with an upland flora and warm and humid climates, which may explain its association with fern spores. The replacement of Classopollis by Araucariacites and ferns reflects a change from a dry to wet phase. The change in flora may be the result of dislocation of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and a relative sea-level rise.",2017,"Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology"
University of Southern Denmark De novo pathway-based biomarker identification,"Gene expression profiles have been extensively discussed as an aid to guide the therapy by predicting disease outcome for the patients suffering from complex diseases, such as cancer. However, prediction models built upon single-gene (SG) features show poor stability and performance on independent datasets. Attempts to mitigate these drawbacks have led to the development of network-based approaches that integrate pathway information to produce meta-gene (MG) features. Also, MG approaches have only dealt with the two-class problem of good versus poor outcome prediction. Stratifying patients based on their molecular subtypes can provide a detailed view of the disease and lead to more personalized therapies. We propose and discuss a novel MG approach based on de novo pathways, which for the first time have been used as features in a multi-class setting to predict cancer subtypes. Comprehensive evaluation in a large cohort of breast cancer samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed that MGs are considerably more stable than SG models, while also providing valuable insight into the cancer hallmarks that drive them. In addition, when tested on an independent benchmark non-TCGA dataset, MG features consistently outperformed SG models. We provide an easy-touse web service at http://pathclass.compbio.sdu.dk where users can upload their own gene expression datasets from breast cancer studies and obtain the subtype predictions from all the classifiers. INTRODUCTION High-throughput gene expression profiling from DNA microarrays in combination with machine learning techniques is a widespread approach to identify genes that can be used to stratify patients into groups with distinct clinical outcome. These so-called gene expression panels (GEPs) can then be used to guide clinicians in selecting the appropriate therapy in complex diseases, for example, lupus (1), Chronâ€™s disease (2) or Parkinsonâ€™s (3). Commercialized GEPs have already been developed for outcome prediction in cancer: MammaprintÂ® (4), a set of 70 genes for lowor high-risk prediction in breast cancer, DecipherÂ® (5), a panel of 22 RNA markers to predict risk of metastases in prostate cancer and OncoType DXÂ® panels for tumor profiling in breast (6), prostate (7) and colon (8) cancer. Although GEPs have shown relative success in cancer prognosis, it was demonstrated that their predictive performance is not consistent across datasets (9). An insufficient number of samples, inherent noise in the experiments and the heterogeneity of cancer patients have been pointed out as main reasons for the lack of feature stability and prediction accuracy. Moreover, cross validation shows that even on a single dataset, the size and composition of the selected gene panels varies strongly (10). The large number of features, which are often correlated, pose a significant challenge in cancer subtyping when only comparably few samples are available (p n problem). Complex diseases such as cancer have thus driven the need for more â€˜systemsâ€™-based approaches that elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the disorder rather than the effect of individual genes. Hence, recent efforts to predict outcome in cancer exploit the wealth of information about proteinâ€“protein interactions, gene regulations, *To whom correspondence should be addressed.

In the context of patient outcome prediction, a popular approach is to aggregate groups of biologically related genes into gene sets with a summary activity score, often called meta-genes (11) (MGs). They are hence also called â€˜composite-featuresâ€™ (12), which are used in supervised learning methods in the expectation that they will provide improved prediction performance and higher feature stability compared with singlegene (SG) panels (i.e. sets of genes treated as a priori unrelated and independent). MGs can also be used to group highly correlated genes and reduce the overall feature number, thus alleviating the p n problem. In addition, MGs representing pathways can provide a higher level of interpretation and help biomedical researchers to identify novel biomarkers and drug targets. To obtain a set of predictive MGs in cancer, some approaches (13,14) use predefined pathways or gene sets expertly curated and stored in public databases (e.g. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) (15), Reactome (16)). However, most a priori defined pathways are not disease-specific and are thus only partially affected during the course of the disease in question. Despite continuous improvement over the years, interaction databases are still biased toward well-understood biological processes and few pathways are compiled and annotated for rare or specific (sub-)types of diseases (17). Other methods (18,19) extract a new list of case-specific pathways by searching for connected subnetworks in a large interaction network. The top ranking subnetworks are then selected and used as MG features for the classification procedure. We previously termed this pathway extraction step as de novo pathway enrichment, (20), although other terms exist as well such as functional module detection or connected subnetwork extraction. Various de novo pathway enrichment methods have been proposed (e.g. (21â€“26)) differing in subnetwork scoring function, optimization criteria or search method. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, popular and well-established methods have never been used in the context of pathwaybased prediction. We believe this is due to limiting factors such as high runtime, low robustness (27), unintuitive parameters or lack of a publicly available software package or web service (23,28) that can be easily integrated into the classification pipeline. For these reasons, it is understandable that most MG classifiers extract subnetworks using simple but fast search heuristic methods (19,29) that may be prone to overlook relevant genes or interactions. Even though previous studies employing MG classifiers report an improvement over SG classifiers, other evaluations (30â€“33) have challenged such claims. In more rigorous and exhaustive simulations performed on larger datasets, Staiger et al. (32) demonstrated that MGs do not outperform SGs in prediction performance or stability over a range of different networks, gene sets or classifiers. In a more recent study (34), Allahyar et al. identified shortcomings that could lead to loss of predictive power of MG classifiers evaluated by Staiger et al. In particular, they argued that using simple averaging operators to produce a MG score can lead to loss of predictive power, while performing feature extraction and feature ranking for selection in separate steps can produce unstable features. Allahyar et al. show that by introducing certain improvements to the MG classifiers that mitigate these problems, their performance increases and in some cases achieve equal or better results than SG classifiers. Allahyar et al. further introduce FERAL, a method that produces multiple MGs from the same gene sets by using multiple aggregation operators. FERAL then implements a sparse group lasso approach that simultaneously selects the features and integrates them into the prediction model, thus avoiding the separate feature selection and ranking procedure. Although the authors report higher prediction accuracy with FERAL compared with other known MG classifiers as well as SGs, improvement over SGs is modest and it becomes evident that cancer outcome prediction based on gene expression might not have the potential to improve significantly regardless of the features, datasets or techniques used to build the classifiers (34). Cancers are often characterized by the occurrence of subtypes with distinct clinical outcome. One example is found in breast cancer, in which clinically relevant subtypes have been defined that show significant differences in terms of their incidence, risk factors, prognosis and treatment sensitivity (35). In clinical practice, breast cancer is classified based on the estrogen and progesterone receptor status, as well as the expression of the Her2 gene. Nevertheless, histopathological classification of the tumor samples is prone to human error given that it must be performed by a skilled pathologist (36). In an effort to more reliably assign subtypes to cancer patients, the PAM50 (37) GEP was developed, a set of 50 genes stratifying patients into five â€˜intrinsicâ€™ molecular subtypes: Basal, Her2, LumA, LumB and Normal-like. Although efforts have been made to obtain smaller gene sets based on gene expression (38), the PAM50 gene panel currently remains the quasi-gold standard for breast cancer subtype classification and has been used, for instance, by The Cancer Genome Atlas (18) (TCGA). In this article, we focus on a pathway-based prediction of cancer subtypes, as opposed to previous MG classifiers, which have only addressed the two class problem of good versus bad outcome prediction (based on time of death, recurrence or metastasis) in cancer patients. We propose a novel pipeline that extracts subtype-specific pathways su",2017,

Regularized logistic regression for obstructive sleep apnea screening during wakefulness using daytime tracheal breathing sounds and anthropometric information,"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a prevalent health problem. Developing a technology for quick OSA screening is momentous. In this study, we used regularized logistic regression to predict the OSA severity level of 199 individuals (116 males) with apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) â‰¥ 15 (moderate/severe OSA) and AHI < 5 (non-OSA) using their tracheal breathing sounds (TBS) recorded during daytime, while they were awake. The participants were guided to breathe through their nose, and then through their mouth at their deep breathing rate. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) feature selection approach was used to select the discriminative features from the power spectra of the TBS and the anthropometric information. Using a five-fold cross-validation procedure, five different training sets and their corresponding blind-testing sets were formed. The average blind-testing classification accuracy over the five different folds was found to be 79.3% Â± 6.1 with the sensitivity (specificity) of 82.2% Â± 7.2% (75.8% Â± 9.9%). The accuracy for the entire dataset was found to be 81.1% with sensitivity (specificity) of 84.4% (77.0%). The feature selection and classification procedures were intelligible and fast. The selected features were physiologically meaningful. Overall, the results show that TBS analysis can be used as a quick and reliable prediction of the presence and severity of OSA during wakefulness without a sleep study.

Penalized regression via the restricted bridge estimator.,"This article is concerned with the Bridge Regression, which is a special family in penalized regression with penalty function $\sum_{j=1}^{p}|\beta_j|^q$ with $q>0$, in a linear model with linear restrictions. The proposed restricted bridge (RBRIDGE) estimator simultaneously estimates parameters and selects important variables when a prior information about parameters are available in either low dimensional or high dimensional case. Using local quadratic approximation, the penalty term can be approximated around a local initial values vector and the RBRIDGE estimator enjoys a closed-form expression which can be solved when $q>0$. Special cases of our proposal are the restricted LASSO ($q=1$), restricted RIDGE ($q=2$), and restricted Elastic Net ($1< q < 2$) estimators. We provide some theoretical properties of the RBRIDGE estimator under for the low dimensional case, whereas the computational aspects are given for both low and high dimensional cases. An extensive Monte Carlo simulation study is conducted based on different prior pieces of information and the performance of the RBRIDGE estiamtor is compared with some competitive penalty estimators as well as the ORACLE. We also consider four real data examples analysis for comparison sake. The numerical results show that the suggested RBRIDGE estimator outperforms outstandingly when the prior is true or near exact",2019,arXiv: Statistics Theory
Semantic binary coding for visual recognition via joint concept-attribute modelling,"Recent years have witnessed the unprecedented efforts of visual representation for enabling various efficient and effective multimedia applications. In this paper, we propose a novel visual representation learning framework, which generates efficient semantic hash codes for visual samples by substantially exploring concepts, semantic attributes as well as their inter-correlations. Specifically, we construct a conceptual space, where the semantic knowledge of concepts and attributes is embedded. Then, we develop an effective on-line feature coding scheme for visual objects by leveraging the inter-concept relationships through the intermediate representative power of attributes. The code process is formulated as an overlapping group lasso problem, which can be efficiently solved. Finally, we may binarize the visual representation to generate efficient hash codes. Extensive experiments have been conducted to illustrate the superiority of our proposed framework on visual retrieval task as compared to state-of-the-art methods.",2018,Multimedia Tools and Applications
Characterization of a prognostic four-gene methylation signature associated with radiotherapy for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) remains one of the most common malignancies associated with poor prognosis. DNA methylation has emerged as an important mechanism underlying the radioâ€‘resistance of tumors. Prognostic biomarkers based on radiotherapyâ€‘related aberrant DNA methylation are limited. Methylation profiles of 388Â patients with HNSCC were acquired from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) portal. Genes with differentially methylated CpG sites (DMGs) were screened between patients with a favorable and poor prognosis with or without radiotherapy. A weight gene coâ€‘methylation network was constructed using a Weighted Gene Coâ€‘expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) package. A lasso Coxâ€‘PH model was used to identify the optimal panel of genes with the ability to predict survival in these patients. Prognostic performance of the multiâ€‘gene methylation signature was assessed in a training set and confirmed in a validation set. A total of 976Â DMGs were observed between favorable and poor prognostic samples. Four DMGâ€‘enriched coâ€‘methylation modules were identified. A fourâ€‘gene methylation signature was determined by the lasso Coxâ€‘PH model that consisted of ZNF10, TMPRSS12, ERGIC2, and RNF215. The risk score based on the fourâ€‘gene signature was able to divide the training or validation set into two risk groups with significantly different overall survival. Thus, the present study revealed a radiotherapyâ€‘related fourâ€‘gene methylation signature to predict survival outcomes of patients with HNSCC, providing candidate therapeutic targets for novel therapy against HNSCC. However, substantial validation experiments are required.",2019,Molecular Medicine Reports
The Density of Linear-Time Properties,"Finding models for linear-time properties is a central problem in verification and planning. We study the distribution of linear-time models by investigating the density of linear-time properties over the space of ultimately periodic words. The density of a property over a bound n is the ratio of the number of lasso-shaped words of length n, that satisfy the property, to the total number of lasso-shaped words of length n. We investigate the problem of computing the density for both linear-time properties in general and for the important special case of \(\omega \)-regular properties. For general linear-time properties, the density is not necessarily convergent and can oscillates indefinitely for certain properties. However, we show that the oscillation is bounded by the growth of the sets of bad- and good-prefix of the property.

They are from ribosomal origin and are post-translationally modified by two enzymes (B and C), one of which shares little similarity to enzymes outside of lasso peptide biosynthetic gene clusters and as such is a useful target for genome mining. In this study, we demonstrate a B protein-centric genome mining approach through which we were able to identify 102 putative lasso peptide biosynthetic gene clusters from a total of 87 different proteobacterial strains. Ten of these clusters were cloned into the pET41a expression vector, optimized through incorporation of a ribosomal binding site and heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). All 12 predicted lasso peptides (namely burhizin, caulonodin I, caulonodin II, caulonodin III, rhodanodin, rubrivinodin, sphingonodin I, sphingonodin II, syanodin I, sphingopyxin I, sphingopyxin II, and zucinodin) were detected by high-resolution Fourier transform mass spectrometry and their proposed primary structure was confirmed through tandem mass spectrometry. High yields (ranging from 0.4 to 5.2 mg/L) were observable for eight of these compounds, while thermostability assays revealed five new representatives of heat labile lasso peptides.",2013,Biopolymers
Paralysie des muscles intrinsÃ¨ques des doigts longs,"Resume Les muscles intrinseques des doigts longs sont les interosseux, les lombricaux et les hypothenariens. Leur action essentielle est la flexion metacarpophalangienne (MP) et lâ€™extension interphalangienne (IP) des doigts. Sur un doigt dont les muscles extrinseques sont actifs, la paralysie intrinseque entraine une deformation en griffeÂ : hyperextension MP et flexion IP. La manÅ“uvre de Bouvier est dite positive si lâ€™extension active IP est possible quand on previent lâ€™hyperextension MP. Les interventions palliatives passives du traitement de la griffe sont les tenodeses et les capsuloplasties. Les palliatifs actifs sont soit a action proximale (restauration de la seule flexion MP par lasso ou par reactivation directe des interosseux), soit a action distale, ayant pour but de restaurer aussi lâ€™extension IP. Lorsque la manÅ“uvre de Bouvier est positive, une deformation en griffe souple peut etre traitee par un palliatif passif et/ou par un palliatif actif a action proximale. Ce dernier est a utiliser en priorite sur lâ€™index et le medius lorsque le nombre des moteurs est reduit. Lorsque la griffe est compliquee de raideur MP en extension, câ€™est lâ€™indication dâ€™une capsulectomieâ€“capsuloplastie. Lorsque la manÅ“uvre de Bouvier est negative, et si les IP sont souples, câ€™est lâ€™indication dâ€™un palliatif actif a action distale, cheminant de preference a la face palmaire du poignet. Meme lorsquâ€™il nâ€™existe pas de griffe, la paralysie intrinseque peut justifier un palliatif actif a action proximale pour stabiliser la prehension et les pinces.

Reconstructing ecological networks with hierarchical Bayesian regression and Mondrian processes,"Ecological systems consist of complex sets of interactions among species and their environment, the understanding of which has implications for predicting environmental response to perturbations such as invading species and climate change. However, the revelation of these interactions is not straightforward, nor are the interactions necessarily stable across space. Machine learning can enable the recovery of such complex, spatially varying interactions from relatively easily obtained species abundance data. Here, we describe a novel Bayesian regression and Mondrian process model (BRAMP) for reconstructing species interaction networks from observed field data. BRAMP enables robust inference of species interactions considering autocorrelation in species abundances and allowing for variation in the interactions across space. We evaluate the model on spatially explicit simulated data, produced using a trophic niche model combined with stochastic population dynamics. We compare the modelâ€™s performance against L1-penalized sparse regression (LASSO) and non-linear Bayesian networks with the BDe scoring scheme. Finally, we apply BRAMP to real ecological data.",2013,
Predicting the risk of sarcopenia in elderly patients with patellar fracture: Development and assessment of a new predictive nomogram,"Purpose This study was aimed at developing a risk prediction model for postoperative dysplasia in elderly patients with patellar fractures in China. Patients and methods We conducted a community survey of patients aged â‰¥55 years who underwent surgery for patellar fractures between January 2013 and October 2018, through telephone interviews, community visits, and outpatient follow-up. We established a predictive model for assessing the risk of sarcopenia after patellar fractures. We developed the prediction model by combining multivariate logistic regression analysis with the least absolute shrinkage model and selection operator regression (Lasso analysis). The predictive quality and clinical utility of the predictive model were determined using C-index, calibration plots, and decision curve analysis. We conducted internal sampling methods for qualitative assessment. Result We recruited 61 participants (males: 20, mean age: 68.1 years). Various risk factors were assessed, and low body mass index and diabetes mellitus were identified as the most important risk factors (P<0.05). The model showed a good prediction rate (C-index: 0.909; 95% confidence interval: 0.81â€“1.00) and good correction effect. The C-index remained high (0.828) even after internal sample verification. Decision curve analysis showed that the risk of sarcopenia was 8.3â€“80.0%, suggesting good clinical practicability. Conclusion Our prediction model shows promise as a cost-effective tool for predicting the risk of postoperative sarcopenia in elderly patients based on the following: advanced age, low body mass index, diabetes, longer postoperative hospital stay, no higher education, no postoperative rehabilitation, removal of internal fixation, and less outdoor exercise.",2019,bioRxiv
Characterization and Comparison of Prokaryotic Epiphytes Associated with Three East African Seagrasses1,"Prokaryotic epiphytes on leaves of three seagrass species, Thalassodendron ciliatum, Thalassia hemprichii, and Cymodocea rotundata, from two Kenyan coastal sites, Nyali (a high-nutrient site) and Vipingo (a low-nutrient site), were characterized genetically and morphologically. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and clone libraries of PCR-amplified 16S rRNA gene fragments were used to study prokaryotes associated with these seagrasses. In general, the epiphytic coverage was greater in the high-nutrient site, while the microbial diversity was linked to seagrass species rather than the study sites. Cytophagaâ€“Flavobacteriaâ€“Bacteroides (CFB) were associated with T.Â ciliatum and T.Â hemprichii mainly in the nutrient-poor site, while Î±-, Î²-, and Î³-proteobacteria were associated with all three species at the two study sites. Some bacteria phylotypes were closely related to sequences of microorganisms previously recovered from wastewaters or other contaminated sources, indicating the influx of land-based wastes into these coastal lagoon ecosystems. The abundance of potential nitrogen (N2)-fixing cyanobacteria on C.Â  rotundata, particularly in the low-nutrient site, suggested that this association may have been acquired to meet N demands. Unicellular cyanobacteria were dominant and associated with C.Â rotundata and T.Â hemprichii (with those on T.Â hemprichii being closely related to cyanobacterial symbiotic species), while T.Â ciliatum was almost devoid of cyanobacterial associations at the same site (Nyali), which suggests specificity in the cyanobacteriaâ€“seagrass associations. The abundance of prokaryotic epiphytes was considered to be linked to water depth and tidal exposure.",2007,Journal of Phycology

Relative-error inertial-relaxed inexact versions of Douglas-Rachford and ADMM splitting algorithms,This paper derives new inexact variants of the Douglas-Rachford splitting method for maximal monotone operators and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for convex optimization. The analysis is based on a new inexact version of the proximal point algorithm that includes both an inertial step and overrelaxation. We apply our new inexact ADMM method to LASSO and logistic regression problems and obtain somewhat better computational performance than earlier inexact ADMM methods.,2020,Comp. Opt. and Appl.
An efficient multi-locus mixed model framework for the detection of small and linked QTLs in F2,"In the genetic system that regulates complex traits, metabolites, gene expression levels, RNA editing levels and DNA methylation, a series of small and linked genes exist. To date, however, little is known about how to design an efficient framework for the detection of these kinds of genes. In this article, we propose a genome-wide composite interval mapping (GCIM) in F2. First, controlling polygenic background via selecting markers in the genome scanning of linkage analysis was replaced by estimating polygenic variance in a genome-wide association study. This can control large, middle and minor polygenic backgrounds in genome scanning. Then, additive and dominant effects for each putative quantitative trait locus (QTL) were separately scanned so that a negative logarithm P-value curve against genome position could be separately obtained for each kind of effect. In each curve, all the peaks were identified as potential QTLs. Thus, almost all the small-effect and linked QTLs are included in a multi-locus model. Finally, adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (adaptive lasso) was used to estimate all the effects in the multi-locus model, and all the nonzero effects were further identified by likelihood ratio test for true QTL identification. This method was used to reanalyze four rice traits. Among 25 known genes detected in this study, 16 small-effect genes were identified only by GCIM. To further demonstrate GCIM, a series of Monte Carlo simulation experiments was performed. As a result, GCIM is demonstrated to be more powerful than the widely used methods for the detection of closely linked and small-effect QTLs.",2019,Briefings in Bioinformatics
La polÃ­tica 2.0 como medio favorecedor para reforzar una serie de ideas y valores del electorado. Caso Guillermo Lasso en las elecciones presidenciales de Ecuador 2017,"The present work consists of analyzing from the perspective of political communication 2.0, the electoral campaign of the candidate Guillermo Lasso for the presidency of the Republic of Ecuador in 2017. The study focuses on the use of the social network Facebook, as the new space to design certain campaign strategies. The variables that intervened in the analysis were the Ecuadorian political context of 2017 and the electoral preferences of the citizens, the role played by Lenin Moreno and Cinthia Viteri, as candidates electorally winners, and the relationship between published content and the reinforcement of certain values and ideas of the Ecuadorian electorate. The results obtained showed that both the general perceptions of the electorate over the country situation, and the surveys of intention to vote, are key factors in the delineation of strategies. Likewise, as the campaign develops, the design of spots is accommodated to what the other candidates do or stop doing, applying, and an offensive or defensive strategy. A third result showed that the content is dependent on the values and general ideas that the electorate feels now. And finally, the 2.0 campaigns in Ecuador are neither determinant nor sufficient to achieve electoral objectives, so necessarily must be completed with the traditional campaign.",2017,
Thesis Abstract Incorporation of genetic marker information in beef cattle breeding programs,"The availability of molecular marker information has turned out to be an opportunity to improve animal breeding programs, by the inclusion of those effects in the estimation of breeding values. Along this perspective, the aims of present research were to compare genetic evaluation models that assume or not marker effects in the estimation of breeding values, as well as to estimate the allelic substitution effects of SNP markers, by applying six different methods (Bayesian multiple regression, Bayesian ridge regression, Bayes A, Bayes B, Bayes CÏ€, and Bayesian Lasso), and to evaluate the impact of these effects on the reliability of breeding values and the divergences in animal classification based on classical breeding values and markerassisted breeding values. Data of 83,404 animals belonging to a Nellore beef cattle (Bos indicus) selection program, measured for post-weaning gain, scrotal circumference and muscle score, and corresponding to 116,562 animals in the relationship matrix, were used. From these animals, a set of 3160 animals with phenotypic and genealogy data available were genotyped with a panel of 106 SNP markers.

Serum copper and ceruloplasmin in patients with psoriasis after helio- and thalassotherapy,"SummarySerum copper level and oxidase activity of ceruloplasmin were determined in psoriasis patients before and after active helio- and thalassotherapy. In a group of 30 patients of both sexes with psoriasis the serum copper level was 29,2% higher in comparison with 20 normal controls and oxidase activity of ceruloplasmin was 116.8% higher than in 100 normal controls. After 4 weeks-long thalassotherapy with 3â€“4 h insolation daily, in correlation with clinical improvement and complete disappearance of the psoriatic lesions, the serum copper level decreased by 28.3% in a statistically significant manner. The oxidase activity of ceruloplasmin decreased insignificantly. The pathogenesis of the psoriasis and the process of keratogenesis and melanogenesis in connection with the copper pathochemistry and the UV-irradiation are discussed.ZusammenfassungEs wurde bei Kranken mit Psoriasis das Kupfer und die OxidaseaktivitÃ¤t des Ceruloplasmins in Serum vor und nach aktiver Helio- und Thalassotherapie untersucht.

Weighted Least Absolute Deviation Lasso Estimator,"The linear absolute shrinkage and selection operator(Lasso) method improves the low prediction accuracy and poor interpretation of the ordinary least squares(OLS) estimate through the use of L1 regularization on the regression coefficients. However, the Lasso is not robust to outliers, because the Lasso method minimizes the sum of squared residual errors. Even though the least absolute deviation(LAD) estimator is an alternative to the OLS estimate, it is sensitive to leverage points. We propose a robust Lasso estimator that is not sensitive to outliers, heavy-tailed errors or leverage points.",2011,Communications for Statistical Applications and Methods
Can the Orion electrograms be the next shining star to help us navigate the pulmonary vein?,"Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) was first described in 1998 by Haissaguerre et al as a technique for ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF). Although multiple other techniques have been studied, either alone or in combination with PVI, PVI remains the primary end-point. With minor modifications in catheter design, circular catheters have been used almost exclusively for the past 20 years to evaluate pulmonary vein (PV) conduction, and the electrograms recorded postablation define successful PVI. Unfortunately, there remains a high recurrence of AF even after acute successful PVI, and, at repeat ablation procedures, the primary finding is recovery of PV conduction at sites previously targeted for ablation. Although the relevance of the recovery of PV conduction noted at repeat ablation procedures has been questioned, the majority of centers still guide the index and repeat ablation procedures based on the presumption that if there was no recovery of PV conduction, the rate of recurrent AF postablation would be significantly reduced. To this end, several techniques have been incorporated into a PVI procedure to assess for early recovery of PV conduction, including a 20to 30-minute wait period post-PVI and then repeat PV recordings, response to pharmacologic testing (isoproterenol; adenosine), and response to pacing (pacing along area of PVI to assess conduction exit block; differential pacing to discern local PV potentials vs far-field atrial recordings). Although acute confirmation of PVI is the currently accepted standard for most AF ablation procedures, a reliable method that would assure permanent PVI is critical to enhance long-term procedure outcome. In this issue of HeartRhythm, Anter et al describe the first comparison of PV recordings from the Lasso catheter (described as the â€œgold standardâ€) and a new minibasket catheter, the Orion catheter, in 12 patients (48 PVs) with AF (58% paroxysmal) undergoing either an index (75%) or repeat PVI procedure using radiofrequency ablation. There are several differences between these recording catheters. The Lasso consists of 20 electrodes, with 1-mm surface area, 3-mm interelectrode spacing, and maximal diameter of 25 mm. Orion has 8 splines with 8 electrodes on each spline.",2015,Heart rhythm
On Regularisation Methods for Analysis of High Dimensional Data,"High dimensional data are rapidly growing in many domains due to the development of technological advances which helps collect data with a large number of variables to better understand a given phenomenon of interest. Particular examples appear in genomics, fMRI data analysis, large-scale healthcare analytics, text/image analysis and astronomy. In the last two decades regularisation approaches have become the methods of choice for analysing such high dimensional data. This paper aims to study the performance of regularisation methods, including the recently proposed method called de-biased lasso, for the analysis of high dimensional data under different sparse and non-sparse situations. Our investigation concerns prediction, parameter estimation and variable selection. We particularly study the effects of correlated variables, covariate location and effect size which have not been well investigated. We find that correlated data when associated with important variables improve those common regularisation methods in all aspects, and that the level of sparsity can be reflected not only from the number of important variables but also from their overall effect size and locations. The latter may be seen under a non-sparse data structure. We demonstrate that the de-biased lasso performs well especially in low dimensional data, however it still suffers from issues, such as multicollinearity and multiple hypothesis testing, similar to the classical regression methods.",2019,Annals of Data Science
"The Volumes of the Royal Medical Society of France, 1776â€“1793: a Window into Innovation, Patronage and Experimentation","In 1776, Doctors Vicq dâ€™Azyr and Joseph de Lassone founded the Royal Medical Society of France and that same year the new Society began publishing an annual volume of news of medical interest, obituaries on the deaths of outstanding doctors and surgeons, articles on new medicine and drugs, on new operations as well as reflecting on the causes of different diseases and illnesses. Between 1776 and 1793, ten of these volumes were published under the title Histoire de la Societe Royale de Medecine: histoire et memoires. The Osler Library of the History of Medicine possesses four of them.

D-trace estimation of a precision matrix using adaptive Lasso penalties,"The accurate estimation of a precision matrix plays a crucial role in the current age of high-dimensional data explosion. To deal with this problem, one of the prominent and commonly used techniques is the $$\ell _1$$â„“1 norm (Lasso) penalization for a given loss function. This approach guarantees the sparsity of the precision matrix estimate for properly selected penalty parameters. However, the $$\ell _1$$â„“1 norm penalization often fails to control the bias of obtained estimator because of its overestimation behavior. In this paper, we introduce two adaptive extensions of the recently proposed $$\ell _1$$â„“1 norm penalized D-trace loss minimization method. They aim at reducing the produced bias in the estimator. Extensive numerical results, using both simulated and real datasets, show the advantage of our proposed estimators.",2018,Advances in Data Analysis and Classification
Bayesian Perspectives on Sparse Empirical Bayes Analysis (SEBA),"We consider a joint processing of n independent similar sparse regression problems.

The dimension p is large enough so that the empirical risk minimizer is not feasible. We consider, from a Bayesian point of view, three possible extensions of the lasso.

Understanding music-selection behavior via statistical learning,"Music psychological research has either focused on individual differences of music listening behavior or investigated situational influences. The present study addresses the question of how much of peopleâ€™s listening behavior in daily life is due to individual differences and how much is attributable to situational effects. We aimed to identify the most important factors of both levels (i.e., person-related and situational) driving peopleâ€™s music selection behavior. Five hundred eightyseven participants reported three self-selected typical music listening situations. For each situation, they answered questions on situational characteristics, functions of music listening, and characteristics of the music selected in the specific situation (e.g., fast slow, simple complex). Participants also reported on several person-related variables (e.g., musical taste, Big Five personality dimensions). Due to the large number of variables measured, we implemented a statistical learning method, percentile-Lasso, for variable selection, which prevents overfitting and optimizes models for the prediction of unseen data. Most of the variance in music selection behavior was attributable to differences between situations, while individual differences accounted for much less variance. Situation-specific functions of music listening most consistently explained which kind of music people selected, followed by the degree of attention paid to the music. Individual differences in musical taste most consistently accounted for person-related differences in music selection behavior, whereas the influence of Big Five personality was very weak. These results show a detailed pattern of factors influencing the selection of music with specific characteristics. They clearly emphasize the importance of situational effects on music listening behavior and suggest shifts in widely-used experimental designs in laboratory-based research on music listening behavior.",2018,
Sub-tidal seagrasses of the Torres Strait: spatial patterns and nutritional value for marine herbivores,"The distribution and nutritional attributes of sub-tidal seagrasses from the Torres Strait, a narrow stretch of water between Cape York (Queensland, Australia) and Papua New Guinea, are described in this report. This project, Understanding Ecosystem Processes, was a joint tender to CRC Torres Strait by the Queensland Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries (Marine Ecology Group), CSIRO, Geoscience Australia, and the Queensland Museum. 
 
Seagrasses analysed in this study were collected using a 1.5m epibenthic sled with net backing (10 mm square mesh) and using a stratified representative pattern during a broad scale survey conducted March - April 2005. Nutritional components of seagrass were analysed using near infrared reflectance spectroscopy. 
 
We examined the distribution and nutritional value of seagrasses in relation to depth and other physical characteristics to increase understanding of factors influencing seagrass distribution and spatial variation in the nutritional value of seagrasses to marine herbivores. Torres Strait seagrasses provide critical habitat for commercial and traditional fishery species including penaeid prawns, tropical rock lobster, dugong and green sea turtles. 
 
Seagrass was recorded at 33.3% of the 168 sub-tidal sites surveyed. The region was characterised by high species diversity with eleven species recorded: Halophila spinulosa, H. ovalis, H. decipiens, H. capricorni, Syringodium isoetifolium, Cymodocea serrulata, C. rotundata, Enhalus acoroides, Halodule uninervis (wide), Thalassia hemprichii, and Thalassodendron ciliatum. Sub-tidal seagrasses typically occurred in large multi-species meadows and displayed a clear east-west partitioning, being abundant in central and western Torres Strait and uncommon in the eastern Torres Strait. Seagrass was most likely to grow in sites where sediments were comprised primarily of muddy sand to gravelly sand. T. hemprichii, C. rotundata, H. uninervis and S. isoetifolium were recorded at depths greater than 25 m, considerably deeper than the 5 - 15 m range these species have previously been found. 
 
The nutritional value of the four most common sub-tidal seagrass species: H. spinulosa, H. ovalis, C. serrulata and S. isoetifolium, was examined. Composition of digestible cell contents (nitrogen, water soluble carbohydrates, starch) and indigestible cell wall components (neutral detergent fibre, acid detergent fibre, lignin) were evaluated as well as in vitro dry matter digestibility and organic matter. There were no significant effects of individual sample site or sample site latitude on the nutrient concentrations of individual seagrass species. When starch was mapped there were two distinct regions containing seagrasses with high nutritional value (north-central and south-western regions). With the exception of a negative linear relationship between starch concentration and water depth for S. isoetifolium, depth had no significant effect on any of the nutrient levels sampled across any seagrass species. 
 
The nutritional profiles of the four tropical seagrasses we sampled were consistent with previous studies of the same species. Significant variation for total starch, water-soluble carbohydrates, in vitro dry matter digestibility, organic matter, acid detergent fibre, neutral detergent fibre and lignin was recorded among the four species. Seagrass nitrogen and starch concentrations, the most important nutrients for marine herbivores, were significantly correlated with species and with plant component. For all seagrass species, the above-ground component (shoots and leaves) possessed greater nitrogen concentration than the below-ground component (roots and rhizomes), which possessed greater starch concentration. S. isoetifolium had the highest nitrogen concentration (1.40 Â± 0.05% DW). However, it also had higher fibre concentration (38.2 Â± 0.68% DW) relative to the other four species. H. ovalis possessed the highest starch concentration (2.76 Â± 0.12% DW) and highest digestibility (83.24Â± 0.66 % DW) as well as the lowest fibre (27.2 Â± 0.66% DW). The combination of broad geographic and depth distributions and nutritional superiority suggests H. ovalis and S. isoetifolium provide a potentially important food source for marine herbivores that forage sub-tidally in the Torres Strait. 
 
The area surveyed represents almost the entire Torres Strait region and provides a valuable snapshot of the distribution and nutritional value of sub-tidal seagrasses in this region. This study contributes to the maintenance of information on seagrass distribution in the Torres Strait, and provides the first baseline study of regional variation in nutritional composition of the four most common sub-tidal seagrasses in Torres Strait. This information can be used in developing Torres Strait environment and fisheries management plans.",2007,
Conformational Changes of the ABC Transporter McjD Revealed by Molecular Dynamics Simulations,"ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) transporters constitute one of the largest protein superfamilies and are involved in a variety of physiological processes such as drug resistance in cancer chemotherapy and maintaining of the blood-brain barrier. Mutations of these proteins are associated with many diseases including cystic fibrosis. ABC transporters utilize the energies of ATP hydrolysis to translocate ligands with diverse chemical properties (such as ions, lipids, and peptides) across the membrane bilayer. An alternating access mechanism has been proposed for their translocation mechanism, in which the protein switches between an inward-facing state and an outward-facing state. Although several ABC transporters have been crystallized in inward- or outward-facing states, the mechanism and extent of the conformational changes remains uncertain. The structure of the ABC exporter McjD from E. coli was recently published in an outward occluded conformation (PDB ID: 4PL0). McjD confers immunity to cells that are producing the antibacterial lasso peptide MccJ25. The cavity of the McjD is accessible from neither the intracellular side nor the extracellular side and may be an intermediate state between the inward- and outward-facing states.After manual docking of the MccJ25 peptide in the cavity of the McjD transporter [1], we applied steered molecular dynamics simulations to pull the ligand out of the extracellular side to investigate the conformational changes during this process. The resulting putative outward-facing state opens to a lesser degree than observed in outward-facing crystal structures. We repeated our simulations with different parameters and the results were reproducible. Therefore, we propose that the large conformational changes implied by some crystal structures are not necessary and that the transporter could accomplish the translocation process with minor structural changes.[1] H.

"Leaf production and nutrient contents of the seagrass Thalassodendron ciliatum in the proximity of a mangrove forest (Gazi Bay, Kenya)","Mangrove forests, seagrass meadows and coral reefs may occur as adjacent ecosystems in tropical coastal zones, where tide-mediated chemical fluxes allow one system to influence another. Previously, stable carbon isotope (13C12C) analyses have been used to show that outwelling of carbon from the mangrove forest of Gazi Bay (Kenya) was followed by trapping of this element in the adjacent seagrass zone. In the present study it was investigated whether the input of mangrove carbon coincides with shifts in functional and chemical characteristics of Thalassodendron ciliatum (Forsk.) den Hartog, the dominant subtidal seagrass. It appeared that the input of mangrove carbon did not coincide with enhanced leaf production of T. ciliatum, nor with consistent shifts in its nitrogen and phosphorus contents. Presumably, carbon outwelling from the mangrove coincides with an only limited export of nitrogen and phosphorus, and the restricted effects of these nutrients on the seagrasses (if any) are masked by other, local factors. The outwelling of mangrove carbon probably includes, in addition to particulate organic matter, dissolved inorganic compounds without nitrogen and phosphorus constituents, such as carbon dioxide and bicarbonate. Although in Gazi Bay seagrass beds are directly adjacent to a mangrove forest and connected with this forest via the shuttle movement of the tidal water, the influence of abiotic fluxes from the mangrove forest on the functioning of the seagrass beds appears to be inconspicuous.",1995,Aquatic Botany

Â«Speculations on Anonymous MaterialsÂ»: la especulaciÃ³n sobre la materialidad del capitalismo artÃ­stico como respuesta crÃ­tica a la estetizaciÃ³n de la vida cotidiana,"En septiembre del 2013 y hasta febrero del 2014, tuvo lugar la exposicion Â«Speculations on Anonymous MaterialsÂ», comisariada por Susanne Pfeffer, en el Museum Fridericianum de Kassel. Tomando tal evento como punto de partida, este texto intenta abordar algunos aspectos que considero cruciales respecto al arte y los futuros especulativos. Con mas de cincuenta obras realizadas por veinticinco artistas europeos y norteamericanos â€“en su mayoria hijos de inmigrantes de primera o de segunda generacionâ€“ la exposicion mostraba una nueva estetica eclectica que parece entrelazar el estilo pop con el post humanista, el post internet o el posdigital, con distintos matices que van desde lo abyecto hasta una cierta forma de futurismo contemporaneo.La exposicion exhibia un presente Â«futurizadoÂ» (o un futuro Â«presentizadoÂ»), al cual se le puede atribuir cierta reflexion acerca de la Â«hiperÂ» y Â«transÂ» estetizacion de lo cotidiano (Lipovetsky y Serroy) de la actual sociedad consumista y posfordista, sobre todo en su forma de capitalismo artistico, ultradigitalizado. Partiendo del materialismo/realismo especulativo (Meillassoux; Bryant; Harman) y el #ACCELERATE. Manifesto para una politica aceleracionista (Alex Williams; Nick Srnicek), se intentara contextualizar teoricamente la exposicion y profundizar conceptualmente en algunos de los artistas participantes, como Timur Si-Qin, Pamela Rosenkranz, Katja Novitskova, Josh Kline y Ryan Trecartin, entre otros.Estos artistas noveles trabajan con el aspecto material de las nuevas tecnologias industriales y digitales, y de los objetos cotidianos (plasticos, imagenes digitales, productos sinteticos, etc.), en obras cuya realidad fisica esta conformada por procesos digitales subliminales y evidencian asi la hiperrealidad en la que estamos sumergidos. Sus obras nacen de una reaccion a la complejidad de la sociedad capitalista contemporanea, a su paisaje cotidiano, y expresan el entorno real y virtual que las generaciones presentes y futuras se ven destinadas a habitar. Pero la exposicion expresa sobre todo, desde el punto de vista estetico y de teoria del arte contemporaneo, un cambio de paradigma onto epistemologico, que es un sintoma de una evolucion respecto a los paradigmas vigentes hasta ahora.",2017,
Pairwise Constraint-Guided Sparse Learning for Feature Selection,"Feature selection aims to identify the most informative features for a compact and accurate data representation. As typical supervised feature selection methods, Lasso and its variants using L1-norm-based regularization terms have received much attention in recent studies, most of which use class labels as supervised information. Besides class labels, there are other types of supervised information, e.g., pairwise constraints that specify whether a pair of data samples belong to the same class (must-link constraint) or different classes (cannot-link constraint). However, most of existing L1-norm-based sparse learning methods do not take advantage of the pairwise constraints that provide us weak and more general supervised information. For addressing that problem, we propose a pairwise constraint-guided sparse (CGS) learning method for feature selection, where the must-link and the cannot-link constraints are used as discriminative regularization terms that directly concentrate on the local discriminative structure of data. Furthermore, we develop two variants of CGS, including: 1) semi-supervised CGS that utilizes labeled data, pairwise constraints, and unlabeled data and 2) ensemble CGS that uses the ensemble of pairwise constraint sets. We conduct a series of experiments on a number of data sets from University of California-Irvine machine learning repository, a gene expression data set, two real-world neuroimaging-based classification tasks, and two large-scale attribute classification tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed methods, compared with several established feature selection methods.",2016,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics
Sparsity Is Better with Stability: Combining Accuracy and Stability for Model Selection in Brain Decoding,"Structured sparse methods have received significant attention in neuroimaging. These methods allow the incorporation of domain knowledge through additional spatial and temporal constraints in the predictive model and carry the promise of being more interpretable than non-structured sparse methods, such as LASSO or Elastic Net methods. However, although sparsity has often been advocated as leading to more interpretable models it can also lead to unstable models under subsampling or slight changes of the experimental conditions. In the present work we investigate the impact of using stability/reproducibility as an additional model selection criterion on several different sparse (and structured sparse) methods that have been recently applied for fMRI brain decoding. We compare three different model selection criteria: (i) classification accuracy alone; (ii) classification accuracy and overlap between the solutions; (iii) classification accuracy and correlation between the solutions. The methods we consider include LASSO, Elastic Net, Total Variation, sparse Total Variation, Laplacian and Graph Laplacian Elastic Net (GraphNET). Our results show that explicitly accounting for stability/reproducibility during the model optimization can mitigate some of the instability inherent in sparse methods. In particular, using accuracy and overlap between the solutions as a joint optimization criterion can lead to solutions that are more similar in terms of accuracy, sparsity levels and coefficient maps even when different sparsity methods are considered.",2017,Frontiers in Neuroscience
Robust Signed-Rank Variable Selection in Linear Regression,"The growing need for dealing with big data has made it necessary to find computationally efficient methods for identifying important factors to be considered in statistical modeling. In the linear model, the Lasso is an effective way of selecting variables using penalized regression. It has spawned substantial research in the area of variable selection for models that depend on a linear combination of predictors. However, work addressing the lack of optimality of variable selection when the model errors are not Gaussian and/or when the data contain gross outliers is scarce. We propose the weighted signed-rank Lasso as a robust and efficient alternative to least absolute deviations and least squares Lasso. The approach is appealing for use with big data since one can use data augmentation to perform the estimation as a single weighted L1 optimization problem. Selection and estimation consistency are theoretically established and evaluated via simulation studies. The results confirm the optimality of the rank-based approach for data with heavy-tailed and contaminated errors or data containing high-leverage points.",2016,
Forecasting Russia's Key Macroeconomic Indicators with the VAR-LASSO Model,"This paper examines an application of the VAR-LASSO model to Russia's key macroeconomic indicators: GDP, household consumption, fixed asset investment, exports, imports, and the rouble real exchange rate, along with oil prices (as an exogenous variable). The slowdown in the Russian economy following the 2008â€“2009 crisis is modelled as a structural break in the unconditional mean of growth rates of the time series under examination. The model is estimated with the assumption of a common growth rate for GDP, consumption, investment, exports and imports (any discrepancies in actual growth rates are due to changing oil prices and other shocks), which provides a solid foundation for balanced medium-term forecasts using an econometric specification that factors in this constraint. The model exhibits fairly good predictive power when pseudo real-time forecasts are benchmarked against the forecast by the Ministry of Economic Development and the forecast given by the BVAR model in Pestova and Mamonov (2016b), as well as against the best (based on the BIC criterion) VAR(1) model and the classical ARIMA model. The estimated model is used to study functions for impulse responses to oil price shocks and to build scenario-driven forecasts for 2019â€“2024.",2019,
Prognostic Value of a Long Non-coding RNA Signature in Localized Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma.,"BACKGROUND
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) can be used as prognostic biomarkers in many types of cancer.


OBJECTIVE
We sought to establish an lncRNA signature to improve postoperative risk stratification for patients with localized clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC).


DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS
Based on the RNA-seq data of 444 stage I-III ccRCC tumours from The Cancer Genome Atlas project, we built a four-lncRNA-based classifier using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operation (LASSO) Cox regression model in 222 randomly selected samples (training set) and validated the classifier in the remaining 222 samples (internal validation set). We confirmed this classifier in an external validation set of 88 patients with stage I-III ccRCC from a Japan cohort and using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in another three independent sets that included 1869 patients from China with stage I-III ccRCC.


OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Univariable and multivariable Cox regression, Harrell's concordance index (c-index), and time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curves were used to evaluate the association of the classifier with overall survival, disease-specific survival, and disease-free survival.


RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS
Using the LASSO Cox regression model, we built a classifier named RCClnc4 based on four lncRNAs: ENSG00000255774, ENSG00000248323, ENSG00000260911, and ENSG00000231666. In the RNA-seq and RT-PCR data sets, the RCClnc4 signature significantly stratified patients into high-risk versus low-risk groups in terms of clinical outcome across and within subpopulations and remained as an independent prognostic factor in multivariate analyses (hazard ratio range, 1.34 [95% confidence interval {CI}: 1.03-1.75; p=0.028] to 1.89 [95% CI, 1.55-2.31; p<0.001]) after adjusting for clinical and pathologic factors. The RCClnc4 signature achieved a higher accuracy (mean c-index, 0.72) than clinical staging systems such as TNM (mean c-index, 0.62) and the stage, size, grade, and necrosis (SSIGN) score (mean c-index, 0.64), currently reported prognostic signatures and biomarkers for the estimation of survival. When integrated with clinical characteristics, the composite clinical and lncRNA signature showed improved prognostic accuracy in all data sets (TNM + RCClnc4 mean c-index, 0.75; SSIGN + RCClnc4 score mean c-index, 0.75). The RCClnc4 classifier was able to identify a clinically significant number of both high-risk stage I and low-risk stage II-III patients.


CONCLUSIONS
The RCClnc4 classifier is a promising and potential prognostic tool in predicting the survival of patients with stage I-III ccRCC. Combining the lncRNA classifier with clinical and pathological parameters allows for accurate risk assessment in guiding clinical management.

ð“0 Regularized Structured Sparsity Convolutional Neural Networks,"Deepening and widening convolutional neural networks (CNNs) significantly increases the number of trainable weight parameters by adding more convolutional layers and feature maps per layer, respectively. By imposing inter- and intra-group sparsity onto the weights of the layers during the training process, a compressed network can be obtained with accuracy comparable to a dense one. In this paper, we propose a new variant of sparse group lasso that blends the $\ell_0$ norm onto the individual weight parameters and the $\ell_{2,1}$ norm onto the output channels of a layer. To address the non-differentiability of the $\ell_0$ norm, we apply variable splitting resulting in an algorithm that consists of executing stochastic gradient descent followed by hard thresholding for each iteration. Numerical experiments are demonstrated on LeNet-5 and wide-residual-networks for MNIST and CIFAR 10/100, respectively. They showcase the effectiveness of our proposed method in attaining superior test accuracy with network sparsification on par with the current state of the art.",2019,ArXiv
Single-port laparoscopic herniorrhaphy using a two-hooked cannula device with hydrodissection.,"BACKGROUND
Laparoscopic percutaneous extraperitoneal closure (LPEC) with variable devices seems to be one of the most simple and reliable methods. We described our modifications of single-port laparoscopic herniorrhaphy using an inner two-hooked cannula device with preperitoneal hydrodissection.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
1568 children with 2114 inguinal hernias were treated by single-port LPEC. Under laparoscopic visualization, the two-hooked cannula device carrying a silk suture was inserted at the point of the internal ring and could be readily kept in an identical path. The hernia orifice was completely lassoed extraperitoneally by the suture with the assistance of hydrodissection. Any huge hernias of more than 1.5â€¯cm were repaired with the incorporation of medial umbilical fold flap as reinforcement.


RESULTS
All hernia repairs were successfully performed by LPEC. 1022 patients had unilateral inguinal hernia repair, and 546 patients underwent bilateral inguinal hernia repair. Of these, additional medial umbilical flap reinforcement was necessary in 68 cases, and an assisted grasping instrument was used in 19 cases owing to omental adhesion or sliding hernia. Mean operating times for unilateral and bilateral inguinal hernia repairs were 9.8â€¯Â±â€¯2.1â€¯min and 13.6â€¯Â±â€¯2.2â€¯min, respectively. There were no operative complications. Two recurrences and three hydroceles were observed during 6 to 30â€¯months of follow-up.


CONCLUSIONS
One-puncture LPEC using the two-hooked cannula device with preperitoneal hydrodissection has proved to be a safe and effective procedure with excellent cosmetic results.

Patterns of nitrogenous waste excretion and gill urea transporter mRNA expression in several species of marine fish,"Abstract. Many prior studies of nitrogenous waste excretion in marine fish have examined excretion patterns for short time periods, and with relatively coarse sampling schemes (e.g., an initial and a final sample point). Recent studies of a ureotelic marine fish (the gulf toadfish, Opsanus beta) have demonstrated that urea excretion in this species occurs in brief but massive bursts, lasting from 0.5 to 3Â h, and often only once per day. The present study sought to determine if prior sampling protocols may have underestimated the amount of urea being excreted by marine fish. A survey of 16 marine species (the teleosts: Myoxocephalus octodecemspinosus, Scophthalamus aquosa, Cyclopterus lumpus, Lophius americanus, Aprodon cortezianus, Cymatogaster aggregatus, Parophrys vetulis, Microstomus pacificus, Hippoglossoides elassodon, Bathyagonus nigripinnus, Ophiodon elongatus, Hemilepidatus spinosus, Icelinus terrius; the elasmobranch: Raja rhina; and the hagfish: Eptatretus stoutii) was undertaken for ammonia-N and urea-N excretion using a long sampling period (48Â h) and hourly sample collection. Apart from the obvious exception of an elasmobranch, ammonia excretion was confirmed to be predominant in marine fish, with urea excretion constituting between 1.4 and 23.8% of the total of ammonia plus urea excreted. Notably, no pulses of urea excretion were detected. Despite the relatively low level of urea excretion, expression of urea transporter-like mRNA (detected using the toadfish urea transporter, tUT, cDNA as a probe) was discovered in gills of many of the species surveyed for nitrogen excretion patterns, although no signal was detected in the hagfish. These results suggest that urea excretion takes place through a specific transport pathway. Finally, more detailed analysis of nitrogen excretion in one of the surveyed species, the plainfin midshipman (Porichthys notatus) demonstrates that ""total"" nitrogen excretion estimated by summing ammonia and urea excretion underestimates true total nitrogen excretion by 37â€“51%.",2001,Marine Biology
"Sparse, Predictive, and Interpretable Functional Connectomics with UoILasso","Network formation from neural activity is a foundational problem in systems neuroscience. Functional networks, after downstream analysis, can provide key insights into the nature of neurobiological structure and computation. The validity of such insights hinges on accurate selection and estimation of the edges connecting nodes. However, commonly used statistical inference procedures generally fail to identify the correct features, and further introduce consequential bias in the estimates. To address these issues, we developed Union of Intersections (UoI), a flexible, modular, and scalable framework for enhanced statistical feature selection and estimation. Methods based on UoI perform feature selection and feature estimation through intersection and union operations, respectively. In the context of linear regression (specifically UoILasso), we summarize extensive numerical investigation on synthetic data to demonstrate tight control of false-positives and false-negatives in feature selection with low-bias and low-variance estimates of selected parameters, while maintaining high-quality prediction accuracy. We demonstrate, with UoILasso, the extraction of sparse, predictive, and interpretable functional networks from human electrocorticography recordings during speech production and the inference of parsimonious coupling models from nonhuman primate single-unit recordings during reaching tasks. Our results establish that UoILasso generates interpretable and predictive functional connectivity networks.",2019,2019 41st Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)
Block-diagonal covariance selection for high-dimensional Gaussian graphical models,"Gaussian graphical models are widely utilized to infer and visualize networks of dependencies between continuous variables. However, inferring the graph is difficult when the sample size is small compared to the number of variables. To reduce the number of parameters to estimate in the model, we propose a non-asymptotic model selection procedure supported by strong theoretical guarantees based on an oracle inequality and a minimax lower bound. The covariance matrix of the model is approximated by a block-diagonal matrix. The structure of this matrix is detected by thresholding the sample covariance matrix, where the threshold is selected using the slope heuristic. Based on the block-diagonal structure of the covariance matrix, the estimation problem is divided into several independent problems: subsequently, the network of dependencies between variables is inferred using the graphical lasso algorithm in each block. The performance of the procedure is illustrated on simulated data. An application to a real gene expression dataset with a limited sample size is also presented: the dimension reduction allows attention to be objectively focused on interactions among smaller subsets of genes, leading to a more parsimonious and interpretable modular network.",2015,ArXiv

The MR radiomic signature can predict preoperative lymph node metastasis in patients with esophageal cancer,"PurposeTo assess the role of the MR radiomic signature in preoperative prediction of lymph node (LN) metastasis in patients with esophageal cancer (EC).Patients and methodsA total of 181 EC patients were enrolled in this study between April 2015 and September 2017. Their LN metastases were pathologically confirmed. The first half of this cohort (90 patients) was set as the training cohort, and the second half (91 patients) was set as the validation cohort. A total of 1578 radiomic features were extracted from MR images (T2-TSE-BLADE and contrast-enhanced StarVIBE). The lasso and elastic net regression model was exploited for dimension reduction and selection of the feature space. The multivariable logistic regression analysis was adopted to identify the radiomic signature of pathologically involved LNs. The discriminating performance was assessed with the area under receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC). The Mann-Whitney U test was adopted for testing the potential correlation of the radiomic signature and the LN status in both training and validation cohorts.ResultsNine radiomic features were selected to create the radiomic signature significantly associated with LN metastasis (p < 0.001). AUC of radiomic signature performance in the training cohort was 0.821 (95% CI: 0.7042-0.9376) and in the validation cohort was 0.762 (95% CI: 0.7127-0.812). This model showed good discrimination between metastatic and non-metastatic lymph nodes.ConclusionThe present study showed MRI radiomic features that could potentially predict metastatic LN involvement in the preoperative evaluation of EC patients.Key Pointsâ€¢ The role of MRI in preoperative staging of esophageal cancer patients is increasing.â€¢ MRI radiomic features showed the ability to predict LN metastasis in EC patients.â€¢ ICCs showed excellent interreader agreement of the extracted MR features.",2018,European Radiology
Mobile target localization through low complexity compressed sensing with iterative alternate coordinates projections,"In this paper, we evaluate the potential of several compressed sensing (CS) techniques for localizing mobile targets within a wireless sensor network. First, we point out the limitations of popular algorithms enabling greedy s-sparse signal recovery, such as the recursive least-absolute shrinkage and selection operator (RLASSO) or the simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit (SOMP). Then, we adapt the previous methods, making use of their non-binary outputs as soft information while accounting for the presence of a mobile target over a 2D grid. We also reformulate the localization problem by considering separable coordinate-wise CS dictionaries and accordingly, we introduce a new iterative gradient descent based solver relying on alternate coordinates projections (IACP). In comparison with conventional approaches, the latter CS solution benefits from arbitrarily fine spatial granularity at very low computational complexity. Finally, we show how successive restrictions of the search area under mobility can contribute to achieve even better localization performance and lower complexity for two of the proposed CS algorithms.",2017,"2017 14th Workshop on Positioning, Navigation and Communications (WPNC)"

"A prospective, multicenter evaluation of ablating complex fractionated electrograms (CFEs) during atrial fibrillation (AF) identified by an automated mapping algorithm: acute effects on AF and efficacy as an adjuvant strategy.","BACKGROUND
Complex fractionated electrograms (CFEs) are continuous electrograms (EGMs) of very short cycle length (CL) representing substrate for atrial fibrillation (AF) perpetuation. Ablation of CFEs may result in AF slowing, termination, and prevention, but identifying them can be subjective.


OBJECTIVE
The purpose of this study was to prospectively assess (1) whether an automated algorithm can identify CFE regions, (2) the acute effects of ablating these regions on AF, and (3) the long-term efficacy as an adjuvant strategy to pulmonary vein antrum isolation (PVAI).


METHODS
Thirty-five patients (three centers, 61 +/- 9 years, left atrium [LA] 43 +/- 9 mm, ejection fraction 53% +/- 7%) with symptomatic paroxysmal (n = 21) or persistent (n = 14) AF were studied. A decapolar lasso (2-mm spacing) was used for mapping. A three-dimensional shell of the LA and pulmonary veins (PVs) was created. If not already in AF, AF was induced by burst pacing (with or without isoproterenol). Atrial EGMs during AF were mapped/analyzed using an automated CFE algorithm. The algorithm measures the time between discrete deflections in a local EGM over 5 seconds (based on selectable width and peak-to-peak [>0.03 mV] criteria). The mean CL of the local EGM is projected onto the LA shell as a color-coded display. Regions of CL <120 ms (published criteria) were targeted for ablation/elimination. Atrial fibrillation cycle length (AFCL) and regularity were measured from the CS. After CFE ablation, further ablation was done to achieve complete PVAI.


RESULTS
AF was spontaneous (n = 20) or induced (n = 15) in all patients. CFEs were most commonly found along the septum (97%), anterior LA (97%), PV antra (83%), base of appendage (83%), and annulus (71%). CFE ablation alone prolonged the AFCL (171 +/- 27 vs. 304 +/- 41 ms; P = .03) and regularized AF to left/right flutter (AFL) in 74% of patients. CFE ablation terminated AF/AFL in 19 patients (54%)-the other 16 were cardioverted-and AF became noninducible in 77%. CFE ablation alone did not cause PV isolation (0.1 +/- 0.3 PV isolated/patient). After combined CFE and PVAI ablation, the single-procedure, off-drug success rate was 83% (follow-up 13 +/- 4 months) versus 71% in matched controls who had PVAI alone (P = .045).


CONCLUSIONS
CFE ablation guided by an automated algorithm resulted in AFCL prolongation, regularization, and noninducibility in most patients. AF terminated in 54% of cases. PVAI with adjuvant CFE ablation has a high efficacy and may be superior to PVAI alone.",2008,Heart rhythm
On cross-validated Lasso in high dimensions.,"In this paper, we derive non-asymptotic error bounds for the Lasso estimator when the penalty parameter for the estimator is chosen using $K$-fold cross-validation. Our bounds imply that the cross-validated Lasso estimator has nearly optimal rates of convergence in the prediction, $L^2$, and $L^1$ norms. For example, we show that in the model with the Gaussian noise and under fairly general assumptions on the candidate set of values of the penalty parameter, the estimation error of the cross-validated Lasso estimator converges to zero in the prediction norm with the $\sqrt{s\log p / n}\times \sqrt{\log(p n)}$ rate, where $n$ is the sample size of available data, $p$ is the number of covariates, and $s$ is the number of non-zero coefficients in the model. Thus, the cross-validated Lasso estimator achieves the fastest possible rate of convergence in the prediction norm up to a small logarithmic factor $\sqrt{\log(p n)}$, and similar conclusions apply for the convergence rate both in $L^2$ and in $L^1$ norms. Importantly, our results cover the case when $p$ is (potentially much) larger than $n$ and also allow for the case of non-Gaussian noise. Our paper therefore serves as a justification for the widely spread practice of using cross-validation as a method to choose the penalty parameter for the Lasso estimator.",2020,arXiv: Statistics Theory
Review on Nowcasting using Least Absolute Shrinkage Selector Operator (LASSO) to Predict Dengue Occurrence in San Juan and Iquitos as Part of Disease Surveillance System,"Dengue which was first detected mainly in South East Asia during 1940s is now a serious public health concern across the subtropical and temperate regions of Americas, Europe and China due to the change in global climate and international travel. Hence, 3.9 billion people in 128 countries are exposed to the danger of potentially fatal dengue infection. This is a review paper of various dengue forecasting methodology to identify suitable models for predicting the disease occurrence in San Juan, Puerto Rico and Iquitos, Peru. Least Absolute Shrinkage Selector Operator (LASSO) model using climatic variables and Google Trends search terms as predictors was proposed to forecast dengue cases four weeks in advance. LASSOâ€™s flexibility in incorporating a variety of predictors and its ease of interpretation present LASSO as a compelling case against the general predictive models. Public health regulators could make use of such nowcasting model to facilitate the timing of vector control and public health campaigns along with the medical resource allocation to cope with potential dengue outbreaks.",2019,Periodicals of Engineering and Natural Sciences (PEN)
Improved method for extracting Fourier transformation infrared spectrum characteristic variable of multi-component gas by aid of TR (Tikhonov regularization),"The invention discloses an improved method for extracting Fourier transformation infrared spectrum characteristic variable of multi-component gas by aid of TR (Tikhonov regularization). The method includes resolving a characteristic variable extracting model into weight sum of the difference of multiple spectral line values; converting an original TR objective function into an objective function based on the model; then adding a bound term of the difference of spectral line positions in the objective function based on the model; realizing optimal functional solution by means of an LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) arithmetic based on an Engl's criterion so as to obtain the optimal value of a regressive vector; and obtaining the characteristic variable capable of overcoming interferences caused by spectrum baseline deviation. The accuracy of online multi-component gas analysis results can be improved by the aid of the improved method. The improved method for extracting Fourier transformation infrared spectrum characteristic variable of multi-component gas by aid of TR can be used for multi-component gas quantitative spectrometric analysis application in the fields of gas logging for petroleum and natural gas exploration, quality control and fault diagnosis of products, hardware, chemical engineering and environmental protection.",2012,
Quantification of plasmacytoid dendritic cells and type 1 myeloid dendritic cells in peripheral blood of renal transplant recipients with and without squamous cell carcinoma.,"Organ transplant recipients are at high risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (1â€“3). These viralassociated skin cancers cause severe morbidity and may also be life-threatening (4, 5). Thus, regular follow-up by a dermatologist is recommended. The time intervals of the examinations should be determined by the individualâ€™s risk for SCC development (6â€“8). One of the main risk factors is long-term immunosuppression (3, 9), leading to severe deficits in immunosurveillance. Dendritic cells (DC) play an important role in immuno surveillance, even though they constitute only 0.5% of the leukocytes in blood (10). Plasmacytoid DC (pDC) are a subset of DC. They produce interferon-alpha (IFN-Î±) and are considered to play a critical role in antiviral immunity (11). Type 1 myeloid DC (mDC1), another DC subset, are responsible for induction of Tcell responses (12). On the basis of the potential of DC to prevent cancer development, we wanted to determine whether renal transplant recipients (RTR) who develop SCC have a reduced quantity of these two DC subgroups in blood compared with RTR who do not develop SCC.",2012,Acta dermato-venereologica

C- Reactive Protein. A study on populations in a mediterranean region.
Summary
Introduction.
Cardiovascular diseases are associated to a high mortality rate in the western world. This study of the C-reactive protein (CRP) was motivated by the need to establish the levels of risk of contracting these diseases and their association with the inflammation process. The American Heart Association (AHA) has established criteria for determining clinical protocols and public health guidelines based on numerous studies on the risk of contracting these diseases, which is considered to be higher in patients with a higher concentration of CRP than those with lower concentrations. Three levels of risk have been identified (?1.0; 1.0-3.0; ?3.0 mg/L). However, there is also a need to know population differences when applying these criteria. This thesis aims to contribute to the knowledge of CRP in order to improve strategies for the prevention of the arteriosclerotic process and/or cardiovascular disease.
Study objectives.
(1) To evaluate a highly sensitive turbidimetric immunoassays for the measurement of using CPR concentrations. (2) To investigate chronological changes in the concentration of CPR in fertile women from preconception through the normal pregnancy term and to evaluate the associations of CRP with the Body Mass Index (BMI) and weight increase among other variables. (3) To establish reference values of CPR in a healthy population and to study the effects on CPR concentrations of nutrition and other factors connected to lifestyle choices. (4) To evaluate the association of CPR and the inflammatory protein MCP-1 in patients with a history of chronic hepatitis.
Conclusions.
On evaluating the hs-CPR method, a sensitivity of 0.3mg/L was found. There was no substancial nterference from hyperlipidemia (triglycerides ? 6 mmol/L), jaundice ( bilirubine ? 175 ?mol/L), haemoglobin ? 5 g/L, and paraproteins (IgG, IgA, IgM ? 20 g/L). In pregnant woman, the mothers weight influence the concentration of CRP. The BMI before conception is related to the levels of CPR in the first term of pregnancy, and the increase in the mothers body weight during pregnancy is associated to the CPR at the birth of the child.The second study, was representative of the healthy adult population in the Mediterranean area. CPR reference values obtained were similar to those of the population in Northern Europe and the USA. The association with nutritional habits were studied. A multivariate analysis between different nutrients and CRP demonstrated an association with the ingestion of folates. Thus, a type of diet (rich in fruit and vegetables) could be implicated to low values of CRP. In the third study, the MCP-1 marker involved in the inflamation process was also studied together with its association to CRP at different levels of inflammation defined in the histology. No association was found between the concentrations of CRP in the blood and the level of liver disfunction even though the values of MCP-1 were indeed related to the evolution of the illness.

Carbon and nitrogen translocation between seagrass ramets,"The spatial scale and the magnitude of carbon and nitrogen translocation was examined in 5 tropical (Cymodocea serrulata, Halophila stipulacea, Halodule uninervis, Thalassodendron cilia- tum, Thalassia hemprichii) and 3 temperate (Cymodocea nodosa, Posidonia oceanica, Zostera noltii) seagrass species using 13 Carbon ( 13 C) and 15 Nitrogen ( 15 N) as tracers in experiments conducted in situ. Seagrass leaf and rhizome production during the study period varied from <0.001 to 0.015 g DW shoot -1 d -1 and 0.002 to 0.017 g DW rhizome apex -1 d -1 , respectively. Based on measured leaf and rhi- zome growth rates, the demand of resources for leaf production varied from 0.19 to 4.99 mgC shoot -1 d -1 , and from 0.01 to 0.24 mgN shoot -1 d -1 , while the demand for rhizome production varied from 0.62 to 5.57 mgC rhizome apex -1 d -1 and from 0.02 to 0.12 mgN rhizome apex -1 d -1 . Seagrass leaves incor- porated the isotopes at rates ranging from 0.04 to 0.63 Âµg 13 C g DW -1 h -1 , and <0.01 to 0.35 Âµg 15 N g DW -1 h -1 . After 4 d, all incubated shoots had shared part of the incorporated 13 C and 15 N with ram- ets placed at maximum distances ranging from 2.7 (H. stipulacea) to 81 cm (C. nodosa), indicating that seagrass clonal integration may be maintained between 1.6 d (H. stipulacea) and 5.4 yr (P. ocean- ica). Resource translocation within seagrass clones was stimulated towards horizontal rhizome apices. Seagrass ramets, in 4 d, shared with their neighbours between 0.37 and 390 Âµg 13 C and between 0.02 and 178 Âµg 15 N. During the study period, resource translocation would supply <5% and up to 40% of the leaf carbon and nitrogen required by a neighbouring developing ramet, respec- tively, and <5% and up to 36% of the carbon and nitrogen required for rhizome growth; provided that the incorporated resources over 1 d were mobilised at similar rates over 4 d. These results con- clusively demonstrate physiological integration between seagrass ramets, and that resource translo- cation may be an important mechanism for young seagrass ramets to acquire resources and for sea- grass clones to expand and persist.",2002,Marine Ecology Progress Series
Selection of stable features for modeling 4-D affective space from EEG recording,"Recent advances in neuroscience made it possible to understand how the human brain processes emotions and affective states. However, the modeling of emotion remains elusive due to inherent ambiguity and complexity related to the perception of emotions, interpersonal variabilities, and context-specific interpretations. Here, we present a robust method of modeling 4-D continuous affective space (Valence, Arousal, Like, and Dominance). First, we determined the functional areas and frequency bands related to 4-D affective space. Second, we extracted and selected a set of stable features. For both steps, we used two different feature selection methods namely: Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and stability selection method. Moreover, compare their performances. For the RFE, we used Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Tree-based bagging, and for the stability selection, we used Randomized Lasso as an estimator. Empirical analysis on the DEAP data set shows that the stability selection method consistently provides relevant set of bands, electrode location and features over a range of model parameters. We also observed that only a small number of locations (40%â€“63%) and certain frequency bands specifically, gamma band frequency over Superior Temporal Gyrus, Supramarginal Gyrus, and Somatosensory Association Cortex were the highest ranked features across the affective dimensions. The selected features using the stability criteria were used to model 4-D affective space using SVR. Empirical analyses shows that the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for Valence, Arousal, Dominance, and Like are 2.13, 2.00, 2.07, and 2.11 respectively. In addition, we also compare the performance of this method with feature fusion and ensemble classification. It was observed that the SVR with selected features outperformed all other approaches. The predicted Valence-Arousal-Dominance were converted to categorical emotions for seamless interpretation.",2017,2017 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)

Rejoinder: The Dantzig selector: Statistical estimation when p is much larger than n,"First of all, we would like to thank all the discussants for their interest and comments, 
as well as for their thorough investigation. The comments all underlie the 
importance and timeliness of the topics discussed in our paper, namely, accurate 
statistical estimation in high dimensions. We would also like to thank the editors 
for this opportunity to comment briefly on a few issues raised in the discussions. 
Of special interest is the diversity of perspectives, which include theoretical, 
practical and computational issues. With this being said, there are two main points 
in the discussions that are quite recurrent: 
1. Is it possible to extend and refine our theoretical results, and how do they compare 
against the very recent literature? 
2. How does the Dantzig Selector (DS) compare with the Lasso? 
We will address these issues in this rejoinder but before we begin, we would like 
to restate as simply as possible the main point of our paper and put this work in a 
broader context so as to avoid confusion about our point of view and motivations.",2007,Annals of Statistics
Palestrina Pal: A Grammar Checker for Music Compositions in the Style of Palestrina,"We introduce Palestrina Pal, a Java-based analysis tool that automates Palestrina-style grammar checking, and that can improve composition, pedagogy, and musicological research (stylistic preferences and similarity assessment). Learning to compose in the style of Palestrina requires the strict adherence to numerous rules in order to achieve the stylistic effect. Palestrinaâ€™s set of counterpoint rules, or a subset thereof, persists in compositions even today. By automating the checking for rule violations, composers can focus on higherlevel issues of musical aesthetics. Palestrina Pal incorporates a graphical user interface for music input, and real-time error detection and visualization. The software uses the GUIDO music notation format, and an objectoriented design that mimics the human evaluation process. We demonstrate the systemâ€™s ability to detect grammar mistakes by testing it on Palestrinaâ€™s own compositions. In the first example, we deliberately introduced specific rule violations by altering a few notes. We show that Palestrina Pal detected all changes, and correctly labels the corresponding rule violations. Next, we evaluate Palestrinaâ€™s motet Sicut Cervus, and discuss Palestrinaâ€™s own rule violations. Finally, we use Palestrina Palâ€™s inbuilt statistical tools to analyze step-wise dissonances in Renaissance motets: five by Palestrina, seven by Lasso, three by Victoria, and two by Byrd. The analysis reveals that Palestrina uses passing tones, suspensions, neighbor notes, and anticipations in decreasing time proportions. A study of dissonance use by Palestrinaâ€™s contemporaries shows the same preference, with Victoria using the most dissonances after Palestrina. An analysis of the effect of voice density on dissonance use reveals some trends: passing tones mostly increase with voice density, with a local peak at three voices; suspensions are convex with a peak at three voices; neighboring tones mostly increase with a local peak at five voices; and anticipations increase monotonically. The distribution of dissonance use remains similar for all voice densities.",2005,

Fused Lasso approach in portfolio selection,"In this work we present a new model based on a fused Lasso approach for the multi-period portfolio selection problem in a Markowitz framework. In a multi-period setting, the investment period is partitioned into sub-periods, delimited by the rebalancing dates at which decisions are taken. The model leads to a constrained optimization problem. Two $$l_1$$l1 penalty terms are introduced into the objective function to reduce the costs of the investment strategy. The former is applied to portfolio weights, encouraging sparse solutions. The latter is a penalization on the difference of wealth allocated across the assets between rebalancing dates, thus it preserves the pattern of active positions with the effect of limiting the number of transactions. We solve the problem by means of the Split Bregman iteration. We show results of numerical tests performed on real data to validate our model.",2019,Annals of Operations Research
"Health Effects of PM 2 . 5 and Its Components on Mortality , Blood Pressure , and DNA Methylation","Epidemiological studies have examined the association between PM2.5 mass and mortality, but there remains uncertainty about the relative importance of species. PM2.5 contains various species, such as organic carbon, elemental carbon, and metals. Determining the differential toxicity of PM2.5 species and identifying species with greatest toxicity is of great importance to emissioncontrol strategies and regulations. In the dissertation thesis, effects of PM2.5 species on health outcomes on different levels were estimated. The first study examined the association between PM2.5 species and mortality on approximately 4.5 million deaths for all causes, cardiovascular diseases, myocardial infarction, stroke, and respiratory diseases in 75 U.S. cities for 2000-2006, using city-season specific Poisson regression and multivariate meta-regression controlled for infiltration. Since cardiovascular diseases are leading causes of death within U.S. population, the second study aimed to determine which PM2.5 species are associated with blood pressure, an indicator of cardiovascular health, in a longitudinal cohort. Linear mixed-effects models with the adaptive LASSO penalty were applied to longitudinal data from 718 elderly men in the Veterans Affairs Normative Aging Study (NAS),",2018,
Gaussian Copula Precision Estimation with Missing Values,"We consider the problem of estimating sparse precision matrix of Gaussian copula distributions using samples with missing values in high dimensions. Existing approaches, primarily designed for Gaussian distributions, suggest using plugin estimators by disregarding the missing values. In this paper, we propose double plugin Gaussian (DoPinG) copula estimators to estimate the sparse precision matrix corresponding to non-paranormal distributions. DoPinG uses two plugin procedures and consists of three steps: (1) estimate nonparametric correlations based on observed values, including Kendallâ€™s tau and Spearmanâ€™s rho; (2) estimate the nonparanormal correlation matrix; (3) plug into existing sparse precision estimators. We prove that DoPinG copula estimators consistently estimate the non-paranormal correlation matrix at a rate ofO( 1 (1 ) q logp n ), where is the probability of missing values. We provide experimental results to illustrate the effect of sample size and percentage of missing data on the model performance. Experimental results show that DoPinG is significantly better than estimators like mGlasso, which are primarily designed for Gaussian data.",2014,
Spike-and-Slab Group Lassos for Grouped Regression and Sparse Generalized Additive Models,"We introduce the spike-and-slab group lasso (SSGL) for Bayesian estimation and variable selection in linear regression with grouped variables. We further extend the SSGL to sparse generalized additive models (GAMs), thereby introducing the first nonparametric variant of the spike-and-slab lasso methodology. Our model simultaneously performs group selection and estimation, while our fully Bayes treatment of the mixture proportion allows for model complexity control and automatic self-adaptivity to different levels of sparsity. We develop theory to uniquely characterize the global posterior mode under the SSGL and introduce highly efficient coordinate ascent algorithms for maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. We further employ de-biasing methods to provide uncertainty quantification of our MAP estimates. Thus, implementation of our model avoids the computational intensiveness of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) in high dimensions. We derive posterior concentration rates for both grouped linear regression and sparse GAMs when the number of covariates grows at nearly exponential rate with sample size. Finally, we illustrate our methodology through extensive simulations and data analysis.",2019,arXiv: Methodology
On Cyclic Gradient Descent Reprojection,"In recent years, convex optimization methods were successfully applied for various image processing tasks and a large number of first-order methods were designed to minimize the corresponding functionals. Interestingly, it was shown recently by Grewenig et al. that the simple idea of so-called â€œsuperstep cyclesâ€ leads to very efficient schemes for time-dependent (parabolic) image enhancement problems as well as for steady state (elliptic) image compression tasks. The â€superstep cyclesâ€ approach is similar to the nonstationary (cyclic) 
Richardson method which has been around for over sixty years. 
In this paper, we investigate the incorporation of superstep cycles into the gradient descent reprojection method. We show for two problems in compressive sensing and image processing, namely the LASSO approach and the Rudin-Osher-Fatemi model that the resulting simple cyclic gradient descent reprojection algorithm can numerically compare with various state-of-the-art first-order algorithms. However, due to the nonlinear

Genetic risk assessment of the joint effect of several genes: Critical appraisal,"When assessing the combined action of genes on the quantitative or qualitative phenotype we encounter a phenomenon that could be named the â€œparadox of the risk score summation.â€ It arises when the search of risk allele and assessment of their combined action are performed with the same single dataset. Too often such methodological error occurs when calculating the so called genetic risk score (GRS), which refers to the total number of alleles associated with the disease. Examples from numerous published genetic association studies are considered in which the claimed statistically significant effects can be attributed to the â€œrisk score summation paradox.â€ In the second section of the review we discuss the current modifications of multiple regression analysis addressed to the so called â€œn â‰ª p problemâ€ (the number of points is much smaller than the number of possible predictors). Various algorithms for the model selection (searching the significant predictor combinations) are considered, beginning from the common marginal screening of the â€œtopâ€ predictors to LASSO and other modern algorithms of compressed sensing.",2016,Russian Journal of Genetics
Dynamic relations between oil and stock market returns: A multi-country study,"Abstract We study the relation between the BRENT and seventeen stock market indexes of important oil-dependent economies. We focus on connectedness between these markets and characterize the dynamics of transmission and reception. We use LASSO methods to shrink, select, and estimate the high dimensional network linking these markets between August, 1999 and March, 2018. This methodological innovation allows the inclusion of a significantly larger number of markets in the network, providing finer results regarding connectedness in the oil-stock market nexus. We show that transmission runs mainly from stock markets to the BRENT. Connectedness varies considerably over time, reaching peaks during times of financial distress. Dynamic predictive causality tests show evidence of time-varying bidirectional causality. Causality from stock markets to the BRENT is detected mostly for the last part of the sample period. This finding indicates that the impact of stock market developments on oil markets is growing over time.",2020,The North American Journal of Economics and Finance
Beating the NaÃ¯veâ€”Combining LASSO with NaÃ¯ve Intraday Electricity Price Forecasts,"In the last three decades the vast majority of electricity price forecasting (EPF) research has concerned day-ahead markets. However, the rapid expansion of renewable generationâ€”mostly wind and solarâ€”have shifted the focus to intraday markets, which can be used to balance the deviations between positions taken in the day-ahead market and the actual demand and renewable generation. A recent EPF study claims that the German intraday, continuous-time market for hourly products is weak-form efficient, that is, that the best predictor for the so-called ID3-Price index is the most recent transaction price. Here, we undermine this claim and show that we can beat the naive forecast by combining it with a prediction of a parameter-rich model estimated using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). We further argue, that that if augmented with timely predictions of fundamental variables for the coming hours, the LASSO-estimated model itself can significantly outperform the naive forecast.",2020,Energies

"Thalassospira lucentensis gen. nov., sp. nov., a new marine member of the alpha-Proteobacteria.","A novel bacterium from the Mediterranean Sea was isolated under oligotrophic conditions at in situ temperature after prolonged continuous culture. The isolates were initially characterized by partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Similarity searches of one of the isolates, QMT2T, indicated high sequence identity to the well-characterized Rhodospirillum rubrum, [Aquaspirillum] itersonii and [Oceanospirillum] pusillum micro-organisms, which are representatives of the alpha-subclass of the Proteobacteria. The highest level of similarity of the complete 165 rRNA gene with respect to these microorganisms was 89%. Features such as the low similarities of 165 rRNA of QMT2T with its phylogenetically close neighbours, the distinct G+C content, and the differences in phenotypic features, including pigmentation, fatty acid composition, salt tolerance, the lack of bacteriochlorophyll a, and the capacity to use carbohydrates as carbon sources, are indicative of the novel nature of the isolate QMT2T among the alpha-Proteobacteria.

eNetXplorer: an R package for the quantitative exploration of elastic net families for generalized linear models,"Background Regularized generalized linear models (GLMs) are popular regression methods in bioinformatics, particularly useful in scenarios with fewer observations than parameters/features or when many of the features are correlated. In both ridge and lasso regularization, feature shrinkage is controlled by a penalty parameter Î». The elastic net introduces a mixing parameter Î± to tune the shrinkage continuously from ridge to lasso. Selecting Î± objectively and determining which features contributed significantly to prediction after model fitting remain a practical challenge given the paucity of available software to evaluate performance and statistical significance. Results eNetXplorer builds on top of glmnet to address the above issues for linear (Gaussian), binomial (logistic), and multinomial GLMs. It provides new functionalities to empower practical applications by using a cross validation framework that assesses the predictive performance and statistical significance of a family of elastic net models (as Î± is varied) and of the corresponding features that contribute to prediction. The user can select which quality metrics to use to quantify the concordance between predicted and observed values, with defaults provided for each GLM. Statistical significance for each model (as defined by Î±) is determined based on comparison to a set of null models generated by random permutations of the response; the same permutation-based approach is used to evaluate the significance of individual features. In the analysis of large and complex biological datasets, such as transcriptomic and proteomic data, eNetXplorer provides summary statistics, output tables, and visualizations to help assess which subset(s) of features have predictive value for a set of response measurements, and to what extent those subset(s) of features can be expanded or reduced via regularization. Conclusions This package presents a framework and software for exploratory data analysis and visualization. By making regularized GLMs more accessible and interpretable, eNetXplorer guides the process to generate hypotheses based on features significantly associated with biological phenotypes of interest, e.g. to identify biomarkers for therapeutic responsiveness. eNetXplorer is also generally applicable to any research area that may benefit from predictive modeling and feature identification using regularized GLMs. Availability and implementation The package is available under GPL-3 license at the CRAN repository, https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=eNetXplorer",2018,bioRxiv
"Key Role of Alphaproteobacteria and Cyanobacteria in the Formation of Stromatolites of Lake Dziani Dzaha (Mayotte, Western Indian Ocean)","Lake Dziani Dzaha is a thalassohaline tropical crater lake located on the ""Petite Terre"" Island of Mayotte (Comoros archipelago, Western Indian Ocean). Stromatolites are actively growing in the shallow waters of the lake shores. These stromatolites are mainly composed of aragonite with lesser proportions of hydromagnesite, calcite, dolomite, and phyllosilicates. They are morphologically and texturally diverse ranging from tabular covered by a cauliflower-like crust to columnar ones with a smooth surface. High-throughput sequencing of bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA genes combined with confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) analysis revealed that the microbial composition of the mats associated with the stromatolites was clearly distinct from that of the Arthrospira-dominated lake water. Unicellular-colonial Cyanobacteria belonging to the Xenococcus genus of the Pleurocapsales order were detected in the cauliflower crust mats, whereas filamentous Cyanobacteria belonging to the Leptolyngbya genus were found in the smooth surface mats. Observations using CLSM, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Raman spectroscopy indicated that the cauliflower texture consists of laminations of aragonite, magnesium-silicate phase and hydromagnesite. The associated microbial mat, as confirmed by laser microdissection and whole-genome amplification (WGA), is composed of Pleurocapsales coated by abundant filamentous and coccoid Alphaproteobacteria. These phototrophic Alphaproteobacteria promote the precipitation of aragonite in which they become incrusted. In contrast, the Pleurocapsales are not calcifying but instead accumulate silicon and magnesium in their sheaths, which may be responsible for the formation of the Mg-silicate phase found in the cauliflower crust. We therefore propose that Pleurocapsales and Alphaproteobacteria are involved in the formation of two distinct mineral phases present in the cauliflower texture: Mg-silicate and aragonite, respectively. These results point out the role of phototrophic Alphaproteobacteria in the formation of stromatolites, which may open new perspective for the analysis of the fossil record.",2018,Frontiers in Microbiology
The nonlinear SchrÃ¶dinger equation in one dimension as a solvable model displaying certain basic features of the many-body problem in the thermodynamical limit,"SummaryThe eigenvalue problem characterized by the nonlinear one-dimensional SchrÃ¶dinger equation â€” [h2/(2m)]Ïˆnâ€³(x)+gf[|Ïˆn(x)|2]Ïˆn(x) = âˆ’É›nÏˆn(x), with boundary conditionsÏˆn(âˆ’L/2) =Ïˆn(L/2) = 0, and normalization

, is investigated, with particular attention to the behaviour in the limitNâ†’âˆž (withL=âˆž, or withL=N/Ï± and Ï± a finite constant). The analogy of this problem, and of the associated variational problem, to that ofN interacting quantal particles in vacuum or confined within a container of volumeV=L is discussed, and used to clarify (by analogy) certain basic features of the many-body problem in the thermodynamical (i.e. macroscopic) limit. In particular, if one assumes the (otherwise arbitrary) real functionf(y) to diverge to positive infinity asyâ†’+âˆž, to change sign at least once and to be finite valued for positivey, the phenomena of condensation (with proper saturation) and of collapse are displayed, corresponding respectively to positive or negative values of the â€œcoupling constantâ€g. In the former, and more interesting, case, the thermodynamical limit can be performed and it yields simple expressions for the quantities of physical interest. In particular the ground-state energy per particle turns out to be directly proportional tog, and the equilibrium density in the condensate to be independent ofg. This contradicts the popular inference of nonanalytic behaviour atg=0, based on the transition, for different signs ofg, from saturating to collapsing regime. The dependence of the ground-state energy per particle, and of the configuration of the system, upon the â€œmean density in the containerâ€ Ï± is also investigated. The possibility that, when compressed, the system separates in two distinct phases, is explicitly displayed in a simple example, and the corresponding behaviours of the energy per particle, and of the density, as a function of Ï±, are exhibited.RiassuntoSi considera il problema agli autovalori caratterizzato dallâ€™equazione di SchrÃ¶dinger non lineare ad una dimensione [h2/(2m)]Ïˆnâ€³(x)+gf[|Ïˆn(x)|2]Ïˆn(x) = âˆ’É›nÏˆn(x), con condizioni al contornoÏˆn(âˆ’L/2) =Ïˆn(L/2) = 0 e normalizzazione

, con particolare attenzione al limiteNâ†’âˆž (conL=âˆž, o conL=N/Ï±, essendo Ï± una costante finita). Si discute lâ€™analogia tra questo problema, espresso anche nella sua forma variazionale, ed il problema quantistico diN particelle interagenti nel vuoto o contenute in un volumeV=L; per analogia si illustrano quindi alcune caratteristiche fondamentali del problema a molti corpi nel limite termodinamico (cioÃ¨ macroscopico). In particolare, nellâ€™ipotesi che la funzione reale (largamente arbitraria)f(y) diverga positivamente quandoyâ†’+âˆž, cambi segno almeno una volta e che sia finita pery positivo, si mostra il fenomeno della condensazione (con relativa saturazione) e del collasso, corrispondenti rispettivamente ai valori positivi e negativi della Â«costante dâ€™accoppiamentoÂ»g. Nel primo caso, che Ã¨ il piÃ¹ interessante, il limite termodinamico si puÃ² calcolare e si ottengono semplici espressioni per le grandezze di interesse fisico. In particolare, lâ€™energia per particella nello stato fondamentale risulta essere direttamente proporzionale ag mentre la densitÃ  dâ€™equilibrio nel condensato risulta indipendente dag. Questo contraddice lâ€™argomento, comunemente accettato, in favore di un comportamento non analitico ag=0, basato sulla transizione, per differenti segni dig, dal regime di saturazione a quello di collasso. Si studia inoltre la dipendenza dellâ€™energia per particella nello stato fondamentale e della configurazione del sistema dalla Â«densitÃ  media nel contenitoreÂ» Ï±. Si mostra esplicitamente in un semplice esempio la possibilitÃ  che, quando compresso, il sistema si separi in due fasi distinte si danno anche i corrispondenti andamenti dellâ€™energia per particella e della densitÃ  in funzione di Ï±.Ð ÐµÐ·ÑŽÐ¼ÐµÐ˜ÑÑÐ»ÐµÐ´ÑƒÐµÑ‚ÑÑ Ð¿Ñ€Ð¾Ð±Ð»ÐµÐ¼Ð° ÑÐ¾Ð±ÑÑ‚Ð²ÐµÐ½Ð½Ñ‹Ñ… Ð·Ð½Ð°Ñ‡ÐµÐ½Ð¸Ð¹, ÑÐ²ÑÐ·Ð°Ð½Ð½Ð°Ñ Ñ Ð½ÐµÐ»Ð¸Ð½ÐµÐ¹Ð½Ñ‹Ð¼ Ð¾Ð´Ð½Ð¾Ð¼ÐµÑ€Ð½Ñ‹Ð¼ ÑƒÑ€Ð°Ð²Ð½ÐµÐ½Ð¸ÐµÐ¼ Ð¨Ñ€ÐµÐ´Ð¸Ð½Ð³ÐµÑ€Ð° [h2/(2m)]Ïˆnâ€³(x)+gf[|Ïˆn(x)|2]Ïˆn(x) = âˆ’É›nÏˆn(x) Ñ Ð³Ñ€Ð°Ð½Ð¸Ñ‡Ð½Ñ‹Ð¼ ÑƒÑÐ»Ð¾Ð²Ð¸ÐµÐ¼Ïˆn(âˆ’L/2) =Ïˆn(L/2) = 0 Ð¸ Ð½Ð¾Ñ€Ð¼Ð¸Ñ€Ð¾Ð²ÐºÐ¾Ð¹

Discriminative Sparse Inverse Covariance Matrix: Application in Brain Functional Network Classification,"Recent studies show that mental disorders change the functional organization of the brain, which could be investigated via various imaging techniques. Analyzing such changes is becoming critical as it could provide new biomarkers for diagnosing and monitoring the progression of the diseases. Functional connectivity analysis studies the covary activity of neuronal populations in different brain regions. The sparse inverse covariance estimation (SICE), also known as graphical LASSO, is one of the most important tools for functional connectivity analysis, which estimates the interregional partial correlations of the brain. Although being increasingly used for predicting mental disorders, SICE is basically a generative method that may not necessarily perform well on classifying neuroimaging data. In this paper, we propose a learning framework to effectively improve the discriminative power of SICEs by taking advantage of the samples in the opposite class. We formulate our objective as convex optimization problems for both one-class and two-class classifications. By analyzing these optimization problems, we not only solve them efficiently in their dual form, but also gain insights into this new learning framework. The proposed framework is applied to analyzing the brain metabolic covariant networks built upon FDG-PET images for the prediction of the Alzheimer's disease, and shows significant improvement of classification performance for both one-class and two-class scenarios. Moreover, as SICE is a general method for learning undirected Gaussian graphical models, this paper has broader meanings beyond the scope of brain research.",2014,2014 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
[Hereditary elliptocytosis in West Africa: frequency and repartition of spectrin variants].,"Hereditary Elliptocytosis (HE) is a hemolytic disorder inherited as autosomal-dominant trait and characterized by elliptically shaped erythrocytes. Preliminary studies in France have showed a high proportion of HE patients of black extraction (West Africa and Antilles). In order to confirm this prevalence, we made a systematic search for HE in West Africa: Benin, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Togo. The diagnosis of elliptocytosis was established by the observation of a high percentage (greater than 70%) of characteristic regular and symmetric elliptic red cells after fixation in 0.3% glutaraldehyde saline buffer. The diagnosis of HE was confirmed by cytological studies of related members and/or the discovery of a well defined molecular variant of spectrin, the main protein of erythrocyte membrane skeleton. We found: in Abidjan centre 6 HE out of 1,000 subjects representative of main ethnic groups; in Lome Centre 6 cases out of 750 subjects originated from the South or Central areas of Togo; in Cotonou Centre 5 cases out of 1,000 subjects originated from the South area of Benin; in Bobo Dioulasso centre 6 HE out of 700 subjects. From this multicentre studies HE appears roughly 10 times more frequent in West Africa than in Europe or USA where incidence was estimated at between 2.5 and 5 cases per 10,000. Tryptic digestion of spectrin revealed that: 10 patients from different ethnic groups have the most frequent variant found in our laboratory (21 kindreds) and named spectrin alpha I/65. Five cases originated from limited areas in the South of Benin and Togo and related to closed ethnic groups have the variant Sp alpha I/46.",1988,"Comptes rendus de l'Academie des sciences.

Tschuschke V (2011) Psychoonkologie. Psychologische Aspekte der Entstehung und BewÃ¤ltigung von Krebs,"Unbestritten hat die HÃ¤ufigkeit von Krebserkrankungen in westlichen LÃ¤ndern zugenommen und wird nach SchÃ¤tzungen der World Health Organization (WHO) bis 2030 um weitere 30% ansteigen. Der wachsenden Inzidenz steht eine seit Anfang der 1990er Jahre abnehmende MortalitÃ¤t gegenÃ¼ber mit der Folge zunehmend chronischer VerlÃ¤ufe und einem ebenso gesteigerten Inanspruchnahmeverhalten bezÃ¼glich psychosozialer Angebote. Das 2011 nunmehr in der 3. Auflage erschienene Buch (1. Aufl. 2002, 2. Aufl. 2005) wendet sich an Behandler und Wissenschaftler mit dem Ziel, nachweisbare psychosoziale Einwirkungen auf den Krankheitsund Gesundungsverlauf bei Krebs auf der Ebene unterschiedlicher QualitÃ¤ten subjektiven Erlebens Betroffener, ihrer jeweiligen GefÃ¼hle von Einflussnahme und erfahrbarer sozialer UnterstÃ¼tzung zu ordnen und damit dem Leser ein evidenzgesichertes Fundament dieser WirkmÃ¶glichkeiten im Beratungsund Behandlungsprozess an die Hand zu geben. Um es vorwegzusagen: Der Autor des Buches zeigt sich dabei als profunder Kenner der Studienlage, scheut jedoch vor kritischer Bewertung der Wissenschaftslandschaft nicht zurÃ¼ck und erlaubt dem Leser, diesen argumentativen Schritten nachvollziehbar zu folgen. Kapitel 1 breitet die Forschungslage hinsichtlich psychosozialer EinflÃ¼sse auf die Entstehung von Krebserkrankungen differenziert aus, verweist aber auch auf den konsenslichen Erkenntniswiderspruch, dass unbestritten die Mehrzahl der Krebserkrankungen zwar auf verhaltensbedingte Ursachen zurÃ¼ckzufÃ¼hren ist (lebensstiloder lebenswandelassoziiert), aber mit der geradezu apodiktisch vorgetragenen Ablehnung einer â€žKrebspersÃ¶nlichkeitâ€œ dem psychischen Teil dieses psychosozialen UrsachengefÃ¼ges der Boden geradezu wieder weggezogen wird. Tschuschke hÃ¤lt diese extrem vorsichtig distanzierte Haltung der europÃ¤ischen, besonders deutschsprachigen â€žscientific communityâ€œ gegenÃ¼ber psychischen EinflÃ¼ssen auf die Krebsentstehung fÃ¼r eine Mischung aus tatsÃ¤chlich geringer Signifikanz aufgrund methodisch zu grob und undifferenziert erfasster psychischer Merkmale in Studien (z. B. Fragebogen vs. differenzierte Interviewtechniken) und einer fast erschrockenen Abkehr vom frÃ¼heren â€žHurra-Stilâ€œ (S. 48) der ersten Psychoonkologen und deren vorzeitigen Schlussfolgerungen, die sich als unhaltbar erwiesen. Zum Lebensstil als pathogenem Oberfaktor werden vom Autor zahlreiche Studien zu Risikoverhaltensweisen bei Krebs (Rauchen, Alkohol, Bewegungsmangel) gelistet und wiederum vor dem Hintergrund des Ã¼bergreifenden Zusammenhangs gesellschaftlicher SchichtzugehÃ¶rigkeit (je niedriger die Schicht, desto schlechter die Prognose einer Krebserkrankung) diskutiert. Allerdings kommen Epidemiologen, die anhand von Wanderbewegungen ganzer Volksgruppen den kongruenten Verlauf von LebensstilverÃ¤nderung und Krebsinzidenz gut belegt haben, nicht zu Wort (z.B. Zeeb Spallek, Razum 2008), was die Schlussfolgerung des Autors, Krebs als eine Ã¼berwiegend gesellschaftlich mitbedingte Erkrankung anzusehen, vervollstÃ¤ndigen kÃ¶nnte.

Pediatric inguinal hernia repair with a single-incision approach using an Endo Closeâ„¢ suturing device,"BackgroundDiverse techniques have been described for pediatric inguinal hernia repair, based on extraperitoneal [1â€“4] and intraperitoneal [5â€“8] methodologies. In this video, we describe a novel technique to repair pediatric inguinal hernia using an Endo Closeâ„¢ suturing device by percutaneous puncture with a single incision.MethodsWith a transumbilical approach, a 5-mm trocar is inserted for a 30Â° laparoscope. A 3-mm incision is made, and the Endo Closeâ„¢ suturing device (Covidien, Minneapolis, MN, USA), with a 2â€“0 polypropylene suture retained by the stylet, is inserted perpendicularly to the skin. An extraperitoneal dissection is made on a side the inguinal ring and the needle of the device penetrates the peritoneum through the inferior border. Then, the stylet mechanism is pushed to free the lasso inside the cavity. At the same incision site, the needle of the Endo Closeâ„¢ is inserted again, but an extraperitoneal dissection is made on the other side of the ring, ensuring that the needle penetrates at the same exit orifice. Now, the suture lasso is recovered and retracted to close the ring. Finally, the suture is extracted and knots are tied extracorporeally at the level of the skin.ResultsA total of 34 patients (20 females and 14 males) underwent surgery with this procedure. Operative time for unilateral repair was 10â€“15 and 25â€“30Â min for the bilateral repair (29 unilateral/5 bilateral). The patients experienced minimal postoperative pain. The follow-up period was 12Â months with no complications, no recurrence and without cases of postoperative hydrocele. There were no injuries to the structures as vessels or vas deferens, and the esthetic outcome was excellent.ConclusionsThe technique presents a simple, safe and reliable method to repair inguinal hernias in children. The long-term results of this novel technique will be evaluated in future studies.",2016,Surgical Endoscopy
The Group Lasso for Design of Experiments,"We introduce an application of the group lasso to design of experiments. Note that we are NOT trying to explain experimental design for the group lasso. Conversely, we explain how we can use the idea of the group lasso in experimental design, showing that the problem of constructing an optimal design matrix can be transformed into a problem of the group lasso. In some numerical examples, we show that we can obtain the orthogonal arrays as the solutions of the group lasso problems.",2013,arXiv: Machine Learning

Bioinformatics Analysis of Prognostic Tumor Microenvironment-Related Genes in the Tumor Microenvironment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma,"BACKGROUND Growing evidence shows that the tumor microenvironment plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The present work aimed to screen tumor microenvironment-related genes strongly related to prognosis and to construct a prognostic gene expression model for HCC. MATERIAL AND METHODS We downloaded gene expression data of 371 HCC patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). A novel ESTIMATE algorithm was applied to calculate immune scores and stromal scores for each patient. Then, the differentially-expressed genes (DEGs) were detected according to the immune and stromal scores, and tumor microenvironment-related genes were further explored. Univariate, Lasso, and multivariate Cox analyses were performed to build the tumor microenvironment-related prediction model. RESULTS Stromal and immune scores were calculated and were found to be correlated with the 3-year prognosis of HCC patients. DEGs were detected according to the stromal and immune scores. There were 49 genes with prognostic value in both TCGA and ICGC (International Cancer Genome Consortium) considered as prognostic tumor microenvironment-related genes. Univariate, Lasso, and multivariate Cox analyses were conducted. A novel 2-gene signature (IL18RAP and GPR182) was built for HCC 3-year prognosis prediction. The 2-gene signature was regarded as an independent prognostic predictor that was correlated with 3-year survival rate, as shown by Cox regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS This study offers a novel 2-gene signature to predict overall survival of patients with HCC, which has the potential to be used as an independent prognostic predictor. Overall, this study reveals more details about the tumor microenvironment in HCC and offers novel candidate biomarkers.",2020,Medical Science Monitor : International Medical Journal of Experimental and Clinical Research
"Aspects of the Ecology of South Polar Skuas Catharacta maccormicki at Hop Island, Rauer Group, East Antarctica","Aspects of the ecology of South Polar SkuasCatharacta maccormicki were investigated at Hop Island, Rauer Group, East Antarctica between December 1990 and February 1991. Data were obtained from pairs across the island generally for comparison with skuas (fringe-dwellers) nesting away from Adelie Penguin Pygoscelis adeliae colonies. While most defended territories included colonies of Adelie Penguins, Antarctic Petrels Thalassoica antarctica or Southern Fulmars Fulmarus glacialoides, others held no surface-nesting seabirds; however, all skuas took penguin material. Activities of two fringe-dwelling pairs, whose territories included fulmars, and fulmars and petrels, were intensively monitored; behaviours were associated mostly with brooding, vigilance or foraging. Foraging trips were longer and less frequent where only fulmars bred, but hunting success was similar to that of the pair hunting in petrel and fulmar colonies. The small number of fringe-dwelling pairs produced proportionally fewer chicks than others; the need to forage away from nesting areas, and to obtain penguin material, even when feeding territories include Antarctic Petrels and or Southern Fulmars, indicates the lower quality of their territories (which may vary). Breeding and other activities are considered in relation to breeding chronology of other local seabirds: the breeding success of fringe-dwellers may be modified by that of neighbouring seabird colonies.",1999,Emu
Identifying a Minimal Class of Models for High-dimensional Data,"Model selection consistency in the high-dimensional regression setting can be achieved only if strong assumptions are fulfilled. We therefore suggest to pursue a different goal, which we call a minimal class of models. The minimal class of models includes models that are similar in their prediction accuracy but not necessarily in their elements. We suggest a random search algorithm to reveal candidate models. The algorithm implements simulated annealing while using a score for each predictor that we suggest to derive using a combination of the Lasso and the Elastic Net. The utility of using a minimal class of models is demonstrated in the analysis of two datasets.",2017,J. Mach. Learn. Res.

"Epibacterium ulvae gen. nov., sp. nov., epibiotic bacteria isolated from the surface of a marine alga.","Two Gram-reaction-negative, rod-shaped, motile bacteria, designated strains U82 and U95(T), were isolated from the marine alga Ulva australis collected at Sharks Point, Clovelly, a rocky intertidal zone near Sydney, Australia. Both strains were oxidase- and catalase-positive, formed brown- to black-pigmented colonies and required NaCl for growth. Phylogenetic analysis based on nearly complete 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that these strains belong to the Roseobacter clade within the Alphaproteobacteria. The 16S rRNA genes of both strains were identical across the sequenced 1326 nt, but showed differences in the intergenic spacer region (ITS) between the 16S and the 23S rRNA genes. At the genomic level the DNA G+C contents of strains U82 and U95(T) were identical (52.6â€Šmol%) and they had a DNA-DNA hybridization value of 83.7%, suggesting that these strains belong to the same species. The closest described phylogenetic neighbour to strains U82 and U95(T) was Thalassobius aestuarii DSM 15283(T) with 95.8% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity. Other close relatives include further species of the genera Thalassobius and Shimia. Strains U82 and U95(T) were negative for bacteriochlorophyll a production, showed antibacterial activity towards other marine bacteria, were resistant to the antibiotics gentamicin and spectinomycin and were unable to hydrolyse starch or gelatin. The major fatty acids (>1%) were 18â€Š:â€Š1Ï‰7c, 16â€Š:â€Š0, 18â€Š:â€Š2, 10â€Š:â€Š0 3-OH, 12â€Š:â€Š0, 20â€Š:â€Š1 2-OH and 18â€Š:â€Š0. The polar lipid pattern indicated the presence of phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, two unidentified aminolipids and four unidentified phospholipids. Both strains produced ubiquinone 10 (Q-10) as the sole respiratory lipoquinone. Based on their phenotypic and phylogenetic characteristics, it is suggested that strains U82 and U95(T) are members of a novel species within a new genus for which the name Epibacterium ulvae gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of the type species is U95(T) (â€Š=â€ŠDSM 24752(T)â€Š=â€ŠLMG 26464(T)).",2013,International journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology
Extending OWL to Support Custom Relations,"Web Ontology Language (OWL) is used by domain experts to encode knowledge. OWL primarily only supports the subClassOf (is-a or inheritance) relation. Various other relations, such as partOf, are essential for representing information in various fields including all engineering disciplines. The current syntax of OWL does not support the declaration and usage of new custom relations. Workarounds to emulate custom relations do exist, but they add syntax burden to knowledge modelers and don't support accurate semantics for inference engines. This paper proposes minimal syntax extension to OWL for declaring custom relations with special attributes, and applying them in knowledge representation. Domain experts can apply custom relations intuitively and concisely as they do with the familiar built-in subClassOf relation. We present our additions to the OWL API for the declaration, application, and visualization of custom relations. We outline our revision and additions to the ontology editor ProteÌgeÌ so its users could visually declare, apply and remove custom relations according to our enriched OWL syntax. Work relating to our modification of the OWLViz plugin for custom relations visualization is also discussed.",2015,2015 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Cyber Security and Cloud Computing
Exploiting the aerobic endospore-forming bacterial diversity in saline and hypersaline environments for biosurfactant production,"BackgroundBiosurfactants are surface-active biomolecules with great applicability in the food, pharmaceutical and oil industries. Endospore-forming bacteria, which survive for long periods in harsh environments, are described as biosurfactant producers. Although the ubiquity of endospore-forming bacteria in saline and hypersaline environments is well known, studies on the diversity of the endospore-forming and biosurfactant-producing bacterial genera/species in these habitats are underrepresented.MethodsIn this study, the structure of endospore-forming bacterial communities in sediment/mud samples from Vermelha Lagoon, Massambaba, Dois Rios and AbraÃ£o Beaches (saline environments), as well as the Praia Seca salterns (hypersaline environments) was determined via denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. Bacterial strains were isolated from these environmental samples and further identified using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Strains presenting emulsification values higher than 30 % were grouped via BOX-PCR, and the culture supernatants of representative strains were subjected to high temperatures and to the presence of up to 20 % NaCl to test their emulsifying activities in these extreme conditions. Mass spectrometry analysis was used to demonstrate the presence of surfactin.ResultsA diverse endospore-forming bacterial community was observed in all environments. The 110 bacterial strains isolated from these environmental samples were molecularly identified as belonging to the genera Bacillus, Thalassobacillus, Halobacillus, Paenibacillus, Fictibacillus and Paenisporosarcina. Fifty-two strains showed emulsification values of at least 30%, and they were grouped into18 BOX groups. The stability of the emulsification values varied when the culture supernatants of representative strains were subjected to high temperatures and to the presence of up to 20% NaCl. The presence of surfactin was demonstrated in one of the most promising strains.ConclusionThe environments studied can harbor endospore-forming bacteria capable of producing biosurfactants with biotechnological applications. Various endospore-forming bacterial genera/species are presented for the first time as biosurfactant producers.",2015,BMC Microbiology
Biological Control of Bruchids in Cowpea Stores by Release of Dinarmus basalis (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae) Adults,"Bruchids cause major losses during cowpea storage in West Africa, Two species, Callosobruchus maculatus (F.) and Bruchidius atrolineatus (Pic), and one endemic pteromalid, Dinarmus basalis (Rondani), are present in the Bobo Dioulasso region of Burkina Faso where this study was carried out. B. atrolineatus adults emerging in the stores from December to January are in reproductive diapause and the C. maculatus population is small. Numbers of C. maculatus increase substantially from February onward when temperatures and humidity rise. The number of D. basalis is low at the beginning of cowpea storage in December and the parasitoid cannot control the C. maculatus population, which therefore causes important seed weight losses. When adults of D. basalis are introduced into the stores at regular intervals, either during the first 2 mo of storage or during the entire storage period, the parasitoids reduce the increase in C. maculatus numbers and the seed weight losses are <100 g/kg of seeds, Releases of D. basalis adults were made in stores containing varieties of cowpea which had been infested naturally in the fields before harvest or were infested artificially. The introduction of high numbers early in the storage period limited the buildup of the bruchid population even when the climatic conditions become favorable for the rapid multiplication of C. maculatus. Studies in the laboratory under controlled conditions confirmed the results obtained under natural conditions in Burkina Faso. A high ratio of parasitoids to host larvae and pupae was critical to the successful biological control. It is only when this ratio is high that C. maculatus populations can be controlled. Biological control of bruchids, using inoculation by D. basalis adults in cowpea stores at the beginning of the storage time, is possible and limits weight losses of stored seeds to <10% after 6 or 7 mo.",1998,Environmental Entomology

Comment on: A survey of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in Korea.,"Sir, Studies on the molecular epidemiological characteristics of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) have demonstrated their genetic and geographic diversity in comparisons between the community-associated (CA) and hospitalassociated (HA) strains. In addition, it has been suggested that the CA-MRSA found in Korea is genetically different from those found in other regions of the world. â€“ 3 Recently, Kim et al. reported a nationwide survey of CA-MRSA in Korea. We also published an article on the same subject in Korea. Both studies confirmed the unique features of the Korean MRSA strains. Kim et al. designed a prospective sentinel hospital laboratory-based survey from seven hospitals in Korea. After dividing the strains into CA-MRSA and HA-MRSA, 72 isolates from each group were compared. Pathogens, colonizers and an â€˜undeterminedâ€™ group were all included in the study. However, we have collected isolates from blood, wounds and pus from six hospitals in an effort to exclude possible colonization and contaminants. The enrolled hospitals did not overlap in the two articles. The definitions of CA-MRSA and multidrug resistance (MDR), and the number of antibiotics used in susceptibility testing, were slightly different in comparisons between the two articles. Kim et al. calculated the resistance rate as the number of intermediate and resistance strains over the total number of strains. In contrast, we did not consider â€˜intermediateâ€™ as resistance. Finally, we clustered MRSA isolates into representative groups based on genetic backgrounds, and clonal types were redefined according to staphylococcal chromosome cassette mec (SCCmec) type and susceptibilities. Despite these differences, both articles demonstrated similar features of the MRSA in Korea: SCCmec type IVA/ST72/Pantonâ€“Valentine leucocidin (PVL)-negative and SCCmec type II or III/ST5 or ST239/ PVL-negative strains were predominant in CA-MRSA and HA-MRSA, respectively. Kim et al. reported that for CA-MRSA, the prevalence of SCCmec type IVA was 43% and the prevalence of ST72 was 35%, and that for HA-MRSA, the prevalence of SCCmec type II or III was 82% and the prevalence of ST5 or ST239 was 86%. Similarly, our data showed that for CA-MRSA, the prevalence of SCCmec type IVA was 53.1% and the prevalence of ST72 was 27.2%, and that for HA-MRSA, the prevalence of SCCmec type II or III was 73.6% and the prevalence of ST5 or ST239 was 73.7%. PVL toxin was rarely identified in either study. In Korea, SCCmec type II or III /ST5 or ST239 was prevalent in HA-MRSA. The articles by Kim et al. and Park et al. elucidated the characteristics of CAand HA-MRSA in Korea. It is interesting that both studies were nationwide studies performed at the same time and had very similar results. We think the data shown in these articles represent the current features of both CAand HA-MRSA in Korea. However, we would like to recommend caution with regard to the conclusion that MDR in CA-MRSA was high (64%), as suggested by Kim et al. Jung et al. also reported that 60.7% of the CA-MRSA isolates were MDR. However, most of their CA-MRSA (82%) were community-onset HA-MRSA cases based on the definition of Kim et al. Another study in Korea showed that ,50% of the strains, among 20 SCCmec type IVA, were MDR when standardized according to the definition of Kim et al. After conforming to the definitions of Kim et al., we re-analysed our data and found that the overall MDR rate, in CA-MRSA, was 51.9%. However, we grouped the clonal types according to their genetic backgrounds and SCCmec type, and found antibiotic susceptibility patterns more distinctly classified (Table 1; modified from Park et al.). For example, most ST72 belonging to B-I were not MDR. B-I, D-I and E-I corresponded to SCCmec type IVA, and most of B-I and D-I were not MDR either. Therefore, the SCCmec type IVA/ST72/PVL-negative clones, the dominant CA-MRSA strains in Korea, were not MDR at least. The clonal types could have the advantage of demonstrating antibiotic susceptibility patterns more precisely than the groups defined by SCCmec only. We agree with Kim et al. and Jung et al. that there were multiple clones of CA-MRSA circulating in communities in Korea and some clones had MDR characteristics similar to HA-MRSA. Even in the dominant SCCmec type IVA in CA-MRSA, our data showed that there would be at least three different groups; however, only 30.2% were MDR. As commented on by Park et al., isolates classified as â€˜undeterminedâ€™ (46.4%) were all recovered from patients with chronic otitis media; most of them belonged to ST5 or ST239, which was predominant in the HA-MRSA. These findings may explain why the authors concluded that the MDR rate was high in the CA-MRSA. If the subgroup analysis was performed for the pathogen, colonizer and undetermined groups, or the clonal type was used in the analysis, a different conclusion would be expected. In order to confirm the epidemiological characteristics, standardization of study design, classifications and definitions are required. Further study is required to monitor the current trends and detect changes when they occur both locally and worldwide.",2008,The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy
Asymtotics of Dantzig selector for a general single-index model,"As two popularly used variable selection methods, the Dantzig selector and the LASSO have been proved asymptotically equivalent in some scenarios. However, it is not the case in general for linear models, as disclosed in Gai, Zhu and Linâ€™s paper in 2013. In this paper, it is further shown that generally the asymptotic equivalence is not true either for a general single-index model with random design of predictors. To achieve this goal, the authors systematically investigate necessary and sufficient conditions for the consistent model selection of the Dantzig selector. An adaptive Dantzig selector is also recommended for the cases where those conditions are not satisfied. Also, different from existing methods for linear models, no distributional assumption on error term is needed with a trade-off that more stringent condition on the predictor vector is assumed. A small scale simulation is conducted to examine the performances of the Dantzig selector and the adaptive Dantzig selector.",2016,Journal of Systems Science and Complexity
Adaptive discriminant learning for face recognition,"Face recognition from Single Sample per Person (SSPP) is extremely challenging because only one sample is available for each person. While many discriminant analysis methods, such as Fisherfaces and its numerous variants, have achieved great success in face recognition, these methods cannot work in this scenario, because more than one sample per person are needed to calculate the within-class scatter matrix. To address this problem, we propose Adaptive Discriminant Analysis (ADA) in which the within-class scatter matrix of each enrolled subject is inferred using his/her single sample, by leveraging a generic set with multiple samples per person. Our method is motivated from the assumption that subjects who look alike to each other generally share similar within-class variations. In ADA, a limited number of neighbors for each single sample are first determined from the generic set by using kNN regression or Lasso regression. Then, the within-class scatter matrix of this single sample is inferred as the weighted average of the within-class scatter matrices of these neighbors based on the arithmetic mean or Riemannian mean. Finally, the optimal ADA projection directions can be computed analytically by using the inferred within-class scatter matrices and the actual between-class scatter matrix. The proposed method is evaluated on three databases including FERET database, FRGC database and a large real-world passport-like face database. The extensive results demonstrate the effectiveness of our ADA when compared with the existing solutions to the SSPP problem.",2013,Pattern Recognit.
De la interpretaciÃ³n polÃ­tica a la lectura cultural en los dramas espaÃ±oles de la generaciÃ³n de 1580,"This article analyzes and challenges the main political interpretations of the dramas written by the 1580â€™ generation. It reviews Anthony Watsonâ€™s monograph about the influence of Portugalâ€™s annexation in the plays written by Juan de la Cueva and Alfredo Hermenegildoâ€™s study on CristÃ³bal de ViruÃ©sâ€™s La gran SemÃ­ramis. The article also suggests two alternative ways of interpretation: the influence of 16th-century Senecan Italian tragedy in those dramas and their intertwinement with the post-Tridentine cultural framework, which attempted to define the limits between kingâ€™s and courtâ€™s power. El teatro ha sido utilizado desde Ã©pocas muy tempranas para sustentar y difundir las causas mÃ¡s diversas. Tal es el caso del teatro religioso o de las distintas formas dramÃ¡ticas que fue adoptando el fasto pÃºblico desde la Edad Media. En el Ãºltimo tercio del siglo xvi, el desarrollo progresivo del teatro comercial generÃ³ una relaciÃ³n nueva entre el espectÃ¡culo y el pÃºblico que ampliaba el horizonte de mensaje de las piezas, otorgando al escritor una mayor libertad artÃ­stica. En este contexto de cambio se sitÃºa la llamada â€žgeneraciÃ³n teatral de 1580â€œ, cuyo estudio se ha visto condicionado por una lectura de sus obras en un sentido polÃ­tico, especialmente los dramas histÃ³ricos y las tragedias.

Elisa Dido, Madrid: CÃ¡tedra, 2003), de BermÃºdez (El tirano en escena, Madrid: Biblioteca Nueva, 2002), etc. DOI 101515/roma.62.12 Hermenegildo encuentra una gran diferencia entre el â€žmonarca semidivinizadoâ€œ que interviene en algunas obras de la comedia nueva, como en El mejor mozo de EspaÃ±a de Lope de Vega, y el que aparece en las tragedias de finales del Quinientos, â€žtragedias que parecen ser los signos fieles del estado de la conciencia polÃ­tica con que un grupo de intelectuales espaÃ±oles, desde lugares distintos y con armas diferentes, pretendiÃ³ hacer frente a la realidad pÃºblica que les rodeaba, es decir, a la concepciÃ³n del poder durante el reinado de Felipe IIâ€œ. En un momento caracterizado por el centralismo del monarca de El Escorial, le resulta llamativo que sean los dramaturgos de las regiones perifÃ©ricas â€“ BermÃºdez por Galicia, Argensola por AragÃ³n, ViruÃ©s por Valencia, Cueva por AndalucÃ­a, etc. â€“ â€žlos que abren sus obras a la problemÃ¡tica del abuso del poder y de sus consiguientes y catastrÃ³ficas consecuenciasâ€œ, y que los escritores identificados con la EspaÃ±a interior â€“ el salmantino Diego LÃ³pez de Castro y el madrileÃ±o Gabriel Lobo Lasso de la Vega â€“ sean, en cambio, â€žlos Ãºnicos que dramatizan el problema del poder polÃ­tico desde una perspectiva diferenteâ€œ.2 Dejando a un lado el uso anacrÃ³nico de la palabra intelectuales utilizada en este contexto, tal interpretaciÃ³n se fundamenta en una dialÃ©ctica de confrontaciÃ³n geogrÃ¡fica que no se manifiesta durante los siglos de oro, al menos en estos tÃ©rminos, y en una lectura en clave antimonÃ¡rquica de una estÃ©tica y de unos temas que eran los propios de la cultura del momento. Como ha advertido el profesor Sirera,3 resulta muy necesario desligarse de los enfoques mÃ¡s afectados por condicionantes histÃ³rico-ideolÃ³gicos para llegar a un conocimiento acertado de la historia literaria y puedan asÃ­ avanzar los estudios teatrales. En estas pÃ¡ginas propongo una revisiÃ³n de este tipo de lecturas polÃ­ticas en los dramas finiseculares. Para ello, realizarÃ© en primer lugar una amplia reseÃ±a de la monografÃ­a que ha fundamentado la interpretaciÃ³n polÃ­tica de los dramas de Juan de la Cueva,4 y ha servido de modelo para el estudio de otras piezas contemporÃ¡neas (n. 1). A este anÃ¡lisis le sigue una reflexiÃ³n sobre La gran SemÃ­ramis de CristÃ³bal de ViruÃ©s, una de las piezas mÃ¡s afectadas por este tipo de acercamientos (n. 2); y, finalmente, propongo algunas vÃ­as de interpretaciÃ³n alternativas (n. 3).

La anexiÃ³n de Portugal y la monografÃ­a de Watson Anthony Watson obtuvo el grado de doctor en 1956 con un estudio titulado The political implications of the drama of Juan de la Cueva, que, con algunos cambios, se publicÃ³ en 1971 como Juan de la Cueva and the Portuguese Succession. A pesar de lo conocida que es esta monografÃ­a, y de lo mucho que ha sido citada, merece la pena detenernos con atenciÃ³n en sus elementos mÃ¡s relevantes, para advertir la necesidad que tienen los estudios actuales de desconfiar de sus conclusiones. El libro estÃ¡ escrito como una â€žpiece of literary detective work in which I set forth the evidence on which I have come to the conclusion that Juan de la Cueva [...] turned to the theatre in 1579 in order to express his views on the problem of the Portuguese Successionâ€œ.5 En la IntroducciÃ³n describe varias piezas de teatro histÃ³rico inglÃ©s, de Ã©poca isabelina, que fueron escritas como un reflejo de los sucesos contemporÃ¡neos y, a partir de ellas, entiende que esa finalidad se puede advertir tambiÃ©n en autores como George Buchanan, escocÃ©s que escribe para representar en Francia, Antonio Ferreira en Portugal y JerÃ³nimo BermÃºdez en EspaÃ±a, y que esa tradiciÃ³n de teatro escolar vendrÃ­a a influir en Juan de la Cueva. MÃ¡s en concreto, sostiene que los sucesos ocurridos entre las batallas de Alcazarquivir (1578) y AlcÃ¡ntara (1580) le llevaron a escribir diez de sus catorce piezas, estrenadas entre 1579 y 1581, con el objetivo de mostrar su desacuerdo por la anexiÃ³n de Portugal. Conviene narrar aquÃ­, por tanto, en pocas lÃ­neas, la historia de aquellos aÃ±os, para poder mostrar despuÃ©s el alcance de su anÃ¡lisis histÃ³rico sobre la interpretaciÃ³n de las piezas literarias.6 El joven rey SebastiÃ¡n I de Portugal soÃ±aba con encabezar una nueva cruzada que tomara por la fuerza el reino de Fez en el norte de Ãfrica. DespuÃ©s de una primera expediciÃ³n en 1574, comenzÃ³ a organizar un ataque a mayor escala. En la Navidad de 1576 se reuniÃ³ con el rey espaÃ±ol en Guadalupe (Badajoz) para solicitar su ayuda, pero Felipe II no vio con buenos ojos este proyecto. A pesar de ello, le prometiÃ³ cincuenta galeras, cinco mil hombres y abundantes pertrechos; un apoyo que se concederÃ­an si los turcos no amenazaban los dominios italianos de los Habsburgo y si la expediciÃ³n tenÃ­a lugar durante el prÃ³ximo verano. La situaciÃ³n internacional de la MonarquÃ­a HispÃ¡nica no facilitaba una mayor implicaciÃ³n. La opiniÃ³n del duque de Alba, que seÃ±alÃ³ en repetidas ocasiones las dificultades tÃ©cnicas de la empresa, debiÃ³ pesar ademÃ¡s en el Ã¡nimo del rey espaÃ±ol. De hecho, la campaÃ±a resultÃ³ un enorme fracaso: en Alcazarquivir vio la muerte el joven monarca, y fue capturada o aniquilada gran parte de la aristocracia lusa. La falta de un heredero provocÃ³ ademÃ¡s un problema sucesorio, que se vio agravado por la penuria econÃ³mica que atravesaba el paÃ­s. OcupÃ³ el trono su tÃ­o abuelo, el anciano cardenal Enrique, que intentÃ³ renunciar a Javier Burguillo 356 5 Anthony Watson, Juan de la Cueva and the Portuguese Succession, London: Tamesis, 1971, pÃ¡g.

Felipe II gozaba de las mejores condiciones y querÃ­a hacer valer sus derechos por la vÃ­a diplomÃ¡tica. Por ello, era necesario que Enrique I â€“ que no aceptaba de buen grado al prior de Crato â€“ le reconociera como su heredero antes de morir. Con esta intenciÃ³n convocÃ³ las Cortes de AlmeirÃ­n (11-I-1580). La nobleza y el alto clero estaban conformes con Felipe II,",2011,
Spatial modelling and volatility matrix estimation in high dimension statistics with financial applications,"High dimension modelling is an important area in modern statistics. For example, a large number of problems that arise in finance are also inspired by more and more available high dimensional data. The main objective of this thesis is to investigate three methodologies in high dimension statistics with the application in finance. The subsequent chapters are organized as follow. The first two chapters are about spatial modeling and its inference respectively. The third chapter tackles a different problem about the estimation of large integrated volatility matrix of high frequency data. In the first chapter, a dynamic spatial model with different weight matrices for different time-lagged spatial effects is proposed. Unlike assuming a known spatial weight matrix, the proposed method estimates each spatial weight matrix for corresponding spatial effect by a linear combination of a set of specified spatial weight matrices to avoid misspecification. To estimate the coefficients for linear combinations and covariates, the pro- filed least square estimation is used with instrumental-like variables. A further selection on spatial weight matrices is introduced by adding an adaptive LASSO penalty on the coefficients of linear combination. All theoretical results are built on the scenario when the sample size T and panel dimension N go to infinity. The functional dependence in time series proposed by Wu (2005) is applied for the asymptotic normality of the estimated parameters. The oracle properties for model selection are developed including the asymptotic normality and sign consistency. Apart from a simulated data used to illustrate the performance of the proposed model, we also apply the proposed model to 32 important stocks from the Euro Stoxx 50 and S&P 500 in 2015 to invest the spatial interaction of them. The second chapter discusses the inference for the spatial dynamic model.To estimate the spatial weight matrices for contemporaneous and timelagged spatial effects, two linear combinations of a set of the specified spatial weight matrices are adopted respectively. We extend the quasimaximum likelihood estimation for the linear combination cofficients in our model and their consistency and asymptotic normality are established when both N and T are large. Using the asymptotic normality of the quasi-maximum likelihood estimators, a Wald test can be employed on the coefficients of the linear combination. Then, a diagnostic test proposed in Chang et al. (2017) is applied to test whether the fitted residuals perform like a white noise vector in our large N and large T setting. Simulated and real data are used to demonstrate the performance of the proposed quasi-maximum likelihood estimation and all above tests. 
The third chapter is about the estimation of large integrated volatility matrix for high frequency data. Besides the microstructure noises and non-synchronous trading times for high frequency data analysis should be fixed, the bias in the extreme eigenvalues coming from the high dimensionality are also not negligible. A nonparametric eigenvalue regularization proposed in Lam (2016) is applied on three existing volatility matrix estimators, such as multi-scale, kernel and pre-averaging realized volatility matrix estimators. One advantage for the proposed estimators is no need for implicit assumptions on the structure of the true integrated volatility matrix. It can be proved that the bias in the extreme eigenvalues can be shrunk and the regularized volatility estimators are positive definite in probability. Incidentally, the bias-corrected versions of kernel and pre-averaging estimators, which have faster rate of convergence at n??1=4 but are not guaranteed to be positive definite in Barndorff-Nielsen et al. (2011) and Christensen et al. (2010) respectively, are now regularized to be positive definite in probability, and we prove their rates of convergence to an \ideal"" estimator under the spectral norm are also at n??1=4 under p=n ! c > 0. Jump and its removal by wavelet method in Fan and Wang (2007) are also included and all theoretical results are still hold. All proposed methods are applied on the simulated data. We also test the performance of the proposed methods on the stocks from the list ""Fifty Most Active Stocks on NYSE"" and ""Fifty Most Active Stocks by Dollar Volume on NYSE"".",2018,
Empirical Performance of Cross-Validation With Oracle Methods in a Genomics Context.,"When employing model selection methods with oracle properties such as the smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) and the Adaptive Lasso, it is typical to estimate the smoothing parameter by m-fold cross-validation, for example, m = 10. In problems where the true regression function is sparse and the signals large, such cross-validation typically works well. However, in regression modeling of genomic studies involving Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP), the true regression functions, while thought to be sparse, do not have large signals. We demonstrate empirically that in such problems, the number of selected variables using SCAD and the Adaptive Lasso, with 10-fold cross-validation, is a random variable that has considerable and surprising variation. Similar remarks apply to non-oracle methods such as the Lasso. Our study strongly questions the suitability of performing only a single run of m-fold cross-validation with any oracle method, and not just the SCAD and Adaptive Lasso.",2011,The American statistician
CHAPTER 11 â€“ Evolution and Radiation,"This chapter discusses the evolution and adaptive radiation of petrels. The adaptive radiation of the Procellariiformes is one of the most extensive and successful among vertebrates. Some, such as Procellaria westlandica, form part of the fauna of temperate rainforests (and the subfossil record shows that others did so in recent times), while Thalassoica antarctica and Pagodroma nivea often breed on the nunataks of Antarctica far from the sea. Among a range of proposals concerning tubenose evolution, there were two general points of agreement. One is that all arose from a single ancestor. The tubular nostrils of similar design throughout, septal olfactory conchae and peculiar form of the gut emphasize this monophyly. The other is that petrels and penguins are closely relatedâ€”as first proposed by Furbringer. The fossil evidence is first looked at while discussing evolution. The past and present radiation is reviewed in this section. Phylogenies are discussed, providing information on relationships with other higher taxa, intergeneric and interspecific relationships, and relationships within species and populations. Vocalizations as taxonomic characters, the beginnings of tubenose radiation, prototubinaire lifestyle, radiation, past geological and climate changes are discussed.",1996,
High Dimensional Variable Selection.,"This paper explores the following question: what kind of statistical guarantees can be given when doing variable selection in high dimensional models? In particular, we look at the error rates and power of some multi-stage regression methods. In the first stage we fit a set of candidate models. In the second stage we select one model by cross-validation. In the third stage we use hypothesis testing to eliminate some variables. We refer to the first two stages as ""screening"" and the last stage as ""cleaning."" We consider three screening methods: the lasso, marginal regression, and forward stepwise regression. Our method gives consistent variable selection under certain conditions.",2009,Annals of statistics

"Trace element contents in the Domeniko lignite deposit, Elassona basin, Central Greece","Abstract Trace elements concentrations were determined in 38 lignite samples and their corresponding 850 Â°C ash from two boreholes of the Domeniko coal deposit (Upper Miocene) in Elassona basin, Central Greece. The methods used were instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA), inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), and atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS). The results showed that all studied elements occur in concentrations within the range of reported values for different coal bearing basins of Greece. The elements U, Th, Cs, Eu, Ce, La, Li, Mo, Y, Pb, and Hg are enriched in the ashes when compared to their average concentration on the Earth's crust. Yb, Y, Lu, Th, La, Sm, Eu, Ce, and V showed positive ( r >0.75) to intermediate (0.65 r",2004,International Journal of Coal Geology
Least squares after model selection in high-dimensional sparse models,"In this paper we study post-model selection estimators which apply ordinary least squares (ols) to the model selected by first-step penalized estimators, typically lasso. It is well known that lasso can estimate the non-parametric regression function at nearly the oracle rate, and is thus hard to improve upon. We show that ols post lasso estimator performs at least as well as lasso in terms of the rate of convergence, and has the advantage of a smaller bias. Remarkably, this performance occurs even if the lasso-based model selection â€œfailsâ€ in the sense of missing some components of the â€œtrueâ€ regression model. By the â€œtrueâ€ model we mean here the best s-dimensional approximation to the nonparametric regression function chosen by the oracle. Furthermore, ols post lasso estimator can perform strictly better than lasso, in the sense of a strictly faster rate of convergence, if the lasso-based model selection correctly includes all components of the â€œtrueâ€ model as a subset and also achieves sufficient sparsity. In the extreme case, when lasso perfectly selects the â€œtrueâ€ model, the ols post lasso estimator becomes the oracle estimator. An important ingredient in our analysis is a new sparsity bound on the dimension of the model selected by lasso which guarantees that this dimension is at most of the same order as the dimension of the â€œtrueâ€ model. Our rate results are non-asymptotic and hold in both parametric and nonparametric models. Moreover, our analysis is not limited to the lasso estimator acting as selector in the first step, but also applies to any other estimator, for example various forms of thresholded lasso, with good rates and good sparsity properties. Our analysis covers both traditional thresholding and a new practical, data-driven thresholding scheme that induces maximal sparsity subject to maintaining a certain goodness-of-fit. The latter scheme has theoretical guarantees similar to those of lasso or ols post lasso, but it dominates these procedures as well as traditional thresholding in a wide variety of experiments.

A matroid associated with a phylogenetic tree,"A (pseudo-)metric D on a finite set X is said to be a \textquotelefttree metric\textquoteright if there is a finite tree with leaf set X and non-negative edge weights so that, for all x,y âˆˆX, D(x,y) is the path distance in the tree between x and y. It is well known that not every metric is a tree metric. However, when some such tree exists, one can always find one whose interior edges have strictly positive edge weights and that has no vertices of degree 2, any such tree is â€“ up to canonical isomorphism â€“ uniquely determined by D, and one does not even need all of the distances in order to fully (re-)construct the tree\textquoterights edge weights in this case. Thus, it seems of some interest to investigate which subsets of X, 2 suffice to determine (\textquoteleftlasso\textquoteright) these edge weights. In this paper, we use the results of a previous paper to discuss the structure of a matroid that can be associated with an (unweighted) X-tree T defined by the requirement that its bases are exactly the \textquotelefttight edge-weight lassos\textquoteright for T, i.e, the minimal subsets of X, 2 that lasso the edge weights of T.",2014,Discret.

Sperm whales from the Miocene of the North Sea: a re-appraisal,"A review of the sperm whales (Cetacea, Odontoceti, Physeteroidea) from the Miocene of the southern margin of the North Sea Basin is undertaken, mostly based on the cranial material of the area of Antwerp (north of Belgium) described for the first time by P.-J. Van Beneden, B. A. L. du Bus, and O. Abel more than a century ago. This work leads to the detailed redescription of the species Eudelphis mortezelensis, Physeterula dubusi, Placoziphius duboisi, and Thalassocetus antwerpiensis, the identification in the North Sea Basin of the eastern North American species Orycterocetus crocodilinus, and the description of a new undetermined physeterid. The stratigraphic information associated to some of these Miocene taxa is refined (E. mortezelensis, O. crocodilinus, and P. duboisi), whereas a more important incertitude persists for others. These results further emphasize the physeteroid diversity during the Miocene. The performed phylogenetic analysis places Eudelphis as the most basal stem-physeteroid, displaying the most salient features of the superfamily (supracranial basin, strong asymmetry of the bony nares and premaxillae) but retaining enamel on teeth and a rather conservative skull morphology (deep maxillary alveoli, large left pre-maxillary foramen, distinct falciform process of the squamosal...). Together with Orycterocetus, Placoziphius is provisionally kept outside the family Physeteridae, defined as the clade grouping all the physeteroids more closely related to Physeter than to Kogia. The large species Physeterula dubusi is the most stemward physeterid, retaining functional upper teeth lacking enamel. Among the physeterids the new undetermined taxon is sister-group to the clade Aulophyseter + Physeter, sharing with these two genera the preorbital process distinctly lower than the lateral margin of the rostrum base. With a sagittal crest in its supracranial basin the small Thalassocetus antwerpiensis is confirmed as an archaic kogiid. The evolutionary history of the supracranial basin and the oral apparatus are discussed. The parsimony analysis suggests that the spermaceti organ remained small in the supracranial basin of most physeteroids, the basin probably functioning as a parabolic structure for reflecting and focusing the echolocative sounds. It is proposed that the spermaceti organ only considerable increased in size in the lineage of the Recent species Physeter macrocephalus, possibly as a sexually dimorphic sound transmitting organ. Preceded by the loss of enamel, the reduction of the upper dentition associated to a decrease of the size of the temporal fossa occurred in parallel in the physeterids and the kogiids, much likely related to a major change in diet and food processing.",2008,

Dal sopralluogo giudiziario agli esami di laboratorio: la perizia e la consulenza tecnica nel libero convincimento del giudice,"Durante questo ciclo di dottorato, attraverso le lezioni ed i seminari tenuti da illustri docenti, la mia
attenzione e la mia curiosita sono state attratte dallâ€™antropologia forense, disciplina che compone il
mosaico delle scienze forensi.
Questa dottrina ricopre particolare importanza allâ€™interno delle scienze forensi, perche deputata
allâ€™identificazione dei resti umani appartenenti ad un soggetto sconosciuto che possono essere
rinvenuti in diverso stato di conservazione. Tale peso e rilevante sia per motivi legali che per motivi
strettamente umanitari.
Lâ€™antropologia forense e unâ€™applicazione dellâ€™antropologia fisica al processo legale.
Gli antropologi forensi utilizzano i metodi scientifici standard dellâ€™antropologia fisica per assistere
la legge nella risoluzione di crimini. Spesso lâ€™antropologo lavora insieme ad un team di
esperti, quali patologi forensi, odontologi, polizia scientifica ed organi investigativi, per stabilire
causa e modalita di decesso ed epoca della morte.
Lâ€™antropologo forense ha il compito aggiuntivo di suggerire eta, sesso, statura e tratto distintivo
â€œleggibileâ€ sullo scheletro.
I metodi e le tecniche per stabilire sesso, eta razza, statura, e per analizzare traumi sono utili
allâ€™antropologo per capire le differenze verticali e orizzontali (nel tempo e nello spazio) delle
popolazioni mondiali.
Quando gli stessi metodi vengono applicati a resti moderni di soggetti sconosciuti, con lo scopo
di identificare e stabilire una modalita di morte, allora siamo nellâ€™ambito forense.
Spesso si tende a confondere il medico legale con lâ€™antropologo forense. Esistono delle
differenze di percorso formativo e di campo dâ€™indagine, anche se la stretta collaborazione delle
due discipline si rende necessaria per ottenere una completezza di risultati.
Lâ€™antropologo forense e un esperto delle ossa, dello scheletro.
Il patologo forense e un medico che effettua autopsie con lo scopo di stabilire una causa di
morte, classificata in diversi modi come causa naturale, accidentale, suicida, omicida, ecc.
Mentre lâ€™antropologo forense focalizza lâ€™osso, il patologo forense focalizza lâ€™attenzione sui
tessuti molli.
Questo spiega perche si possa incorrere in errori valutativi, quando una disciplina cerchi di
prevaricare lâ€™altra: il medico legale non puo improvvisarsi antropologo e lâ€™antropologo non puo
sopperire al medico legale.
Il problema in Italia e che non si e ancora diffusa una cultura antropologica forense sicche spesso
e il medico da solo che si trova a dare giudizi tecnici fuori delle proprie competenze, incappando
in errori madornali (scambio dâ€™ossa di pollo per ossa umane, perdita di dettagli quali fratture
ossee ecc.) o in impossibilita identificativa per mancanza di dati.
Le indagini riguardanti unâ€™ipotesi di reato hanno inizio a partire dalla scena del crimine.
Lâ€™intervento sul luogo del delitto, cioe il sopralluogo giudiziario, coinvolge o dovrebbe
coinvolgere un insieme di esperti in Scienze Forensi, atti ognuno a raccogliere informazioni,
repertare e conservare indizi probatori il dato di fatto.
I successivi passi verso la risoluzione del caso portano necessariamente alla separazione del
team, ognuno operante nel settore di sua competenza. Il medico legale, lâ€™antropologo e
lâ€™odontologo, ad esempio, una volta effettuati i prelievi sul luogo, necessitano di analisi piu
approfondite, che vanno dallâ€™esame autoptico ad una serie di analisi di laboratorio, generalmente
finalizzate a ricostruire un profilo biologico, unâ€™identita personale quando possibile, una causa di
morte ed unâ€™epoca della morte.
I risultati che ne derivano vengono poi tramutati in consulenze tecniche o perizie, che hanno lo
scopo di tradurre al magistrato il dato tecnico specialistico. Il Magistrato, proprio per il ruolo che
ricopre e, per antonomasia, il â€œperitus peritorumâ€. Poiche le sue competenze tecniche non
gli consentono di portare avanti una specifica indagine sul quesito da egli stesso formulato, e
tenuto a nominare, per tale compito, un esperto.
In questa tesi di dottorato si e proceduto, inoltre, ad illustrare e ad approfondire gli istituti della
perizia e della consulenza tecnica nel sistema giudiziale italiano, con particolare riferimento al
riflesso derivato dallâ€™attivita svolta dal perito e dal consulente tecnico sul libero giudizio del
magistrato.
Per evidenziare come e in quale misura il convincimento del giudice possa essere influenzato
dallâ€™attivita di consulenza e dallâ€™attivita peritale, e stato necessario ripercorrere le varie procedure
che disciplinano il complesso ordinamento italiano, delineando un excursus delle diverse
procedure: civile, penale, del lavoro, della navigazione e fallimentare.
Il punto focale che emerge dal nostro sistema processuale, dopo lâ€™introduzione del cosiddetto
â€œgiusto processoâ€ (legge cost. 23 novembre 1999, n. 2, comma1), e la contrapposizione delle parti,
al cui centro si pone la figura del giudice (super partes), che viene coadiuvato, nelle attivita
tecniche, dai professionisti, al fine di pervenire alla cosiddetta â€œverita processualeâ€.
Il ricorso alla perizia ed alla consulenza tecnica ha avuto unâ€™evoluzione altalenante nel corso di
questo secolo. Infatti, mentre il codice di rito del 1913 prevedeva lâ€™utilizzo smodato della perizia,
il legislatore del 1930 fu piuttosto restio nellâ€™ammettere scienze â€œnon giuridicheâ€, considerate â€œnon
esatteâ€, allâ€™interno del processo. Lâ€™art. 314 del codice penale del 1930 dava facolta al giudice di
ricorrere alla perizia, attribuendogli una sorta di autarchia culturale sottintendendo lâ€™inesistenza di
un obbligo per il giudice di richiedere lâ€™ausilio di un consulente tecnico esperto. Il legislatore del
1930 pose difatti espliciti divieti di tipo oggettivo (art. 314 comma 2, c.p.p. 1930), rendendo il
processo penale non permeabile al contributo delle scienze â€œumaneâ€ quali la psicologia, la
criminologia, lâ€™antropologia criminale. Da cio si coglie una presunzione iuris et de iure di capacita
del giudice di risolvere con i propri strumenti culturali i dubbi sollevati nel corso della fattispecie
da esaminare.
Unâ€™ulteriore evoluzione il sistema giudiziario italiano lo ebbe con il Regio Decreto Legge del 20
luglio del 1934, n. 1404, che concesse in materia minorile lâ€™utilizzo della perizia e previde la
â€œdoverositaâ€ delle indagini sulla personalita del minore, svolte dal perito, per consentire al giudice
un quadro completo sotto lâ€™aspetto psico â€“fisico e morale dellâ€™imputato. Si dovette poi attendere il
1955, quando il legislatore stabili che il giudice â€œdovesseâ€ disporre la perizia, sostituendo
definitivamente con un obbligo la facolta che ancora era in vigore dal codice di rito del 1934.
Con il nuovo rito accusatorio, alle soglie del ventunesimo secolo, lâ€™orientamento legislativo e
completamente mutato nel senso che la perizia e obbligatoria â€œquando occorre svolgere indagini o
acquisire dati o valutazioni che richiedono specifiche competenze tecniche, scientifiche o
artisticheâ€ (art. 220, primo comma del c.p.p.). Il giudice, quindi, ogni qual volta che egli si trovi a
fronteggiare questioni che necessitano di particolari conoscenze tecnicoâ€“specialistiche
(ingegneristiche, mediche, balistiche, etc.), si fa assistere da uno o piu professionisti che sceglie tra
quelli che sono iscritti in appositi albi tenuti presso il Tribunale o â€œtra persone fornite di particolare
competenza nella specifica disciplinaâ€. Eâ€™ previsto inoltre che il conferimento dellâ€™incarico possa
essere indirizzato a piu persone â€œquando le indagini e le valutazioni siano di notevole complessita
ovvero richiedano distinte conoscenze in differenti disciplineâ€ (art. 221 c.p.p.).
Tali professionisti assumono denominazioni diverse a seconda dell'Organo che conferisce loro
lâ€™incarico: Consulente Tecnico d'Ufficio (C.T.U.) se l'incarico proviene dal giudice civile;
Consulente Tecnico del Pubblico Ministero (PM), quando l'incarico viene conferito nel corso delle
indagini preliminari dallo stesso PM; Consulente Tecnico di Parte, quando lâ€™incarico viene
conferito dalla parte processuale; Perito, quando giudice nel corso del processo penale da incarico
al professionista.
Il compito del professionista e quello di dare immediata risposta ai quesiti posti dal giudice, nel
lasso di tempo, che generalmente e di novanta giorni (art. 227, comma 3, c.p.p.), che il magistrato
lascia al professionista per adempiere ai propri obblighi. Queste risposte, date allâ€™organo
giudicante attraverso perizia o eventualmente consulenza tecnica, sono determinanti al fine della
decisione finale. Infatti, nonostante il magistrato sia legato al principio del cosiddetto â€œlibero
convincimentoâ€, questi non puo compiere scelte arbitrarie svincolate dai risultati dellâ€™acquisizione
probatoria. Il giudice, secondo quanto diceva Pessina â€œe libero di credere o non credere alle prove
addotte, ma non puo uscire dai confini legaliâ€ e di cio che e stato provato in sede dibattimentale.
In base allâ€™art. 226, comma 2, c.p.p. il giudice pone i quesiti, â€œsentiti i periti, i consulenti tecnici, il
pubblico ministero ed i difensori presentiâ€, assurgendo cosi il quesito a frutto dellâ€™incontro sul
tema della prova peritale, in cui il patrimonio di conoscenze di coloro che a vario titolo
intervengono nel giudizio si sintetizzano nel dispositivo giudiziale.",2008,
Factors associated with common mental health problems of humanitarian workers in South Sudan,"BACKGROUND
The latest data on major attacks against civilian aid operations have identified South Sudan as the most dangerous country for aid workers globally. Exposure to other traumatic events and chronic stress is also common in this population. No research exists on the mental health of humanitarian workers in South Sudan.


OBJECTIVES
This study examined symptom burden and predictors of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, hazardous alcohol consumption, and burnout among humanitarian workers in South Sudan.


METHOD
We conducted a cross-sectional online survey with humanitarian workers (national and international staff, consultants, United Nations volunteers). We applied validated measures useful for this setting. We applied Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression to fit models with high prediction accuracy for each outcome and used ordinary least squares (OLS) regression to obtain final coefficients and perform inference.


RESULTS
A total of 277 humanitarian workers employed by 45 organizations completed the survey (a response rate in the order of 10%). We estimated prevalence of PTSD (24%), depression (39%), anxiety disorder (38%), hazardous alcohol consumption in men (35%) and women (36%), and the burnout components emotional exhaustion (24%) and depersonalization (19%). Chronic stress exposure was positively associated with PTSD (p < .001), depression (p < .001), anxiety (p < .001), emotional exhaustion (p < .01), and depersonalization (p < .001). We found no significant association between emotion focused and problem focused coping and mental health outcomes. Associations between dysfunctional coping and depression (p < .001) and anxiety (p < .01) were positive. Higher levels of spirituality were associated with lower risk of hazardous alcohol consumption (p < .001). Contrary to expectations, working directly with humanitarian aid beneficiaries was significantly associated with lower risk for emotional exhaustion (p < .01).


CONCLUSION
Our results suggest that humanitarian workers in South Sudan experience substantial levels of mental ill-health. This study points to the need for staff support strategies that effectively mitigate humanitarian workers' chronic stress exposure. The dynamics between coping and mental health among humanitarian workers require further study.",2018,PLoS ONE
Tweedieâ€™s Compound Poisson Model With Grouped Elastic Net,"Tweedieâ€™s compound Poisson model is a popular method to model data with probability mass at zero and nonnegative, highly right-skewed distribution. Motivated by wide applications of the Tweedie model in various fields such as actuarial science, we investigate the grouped elastic net method for the Tweedie model in the context of the generalized linear model. To efficiently compute the estimation coefficients, we devise a two-layer algorithm that embeds the blockwise majorization descent method into an iteratively reweighted least square strategy. Integrated with the strong rule, the proposed algorithm is implemented in an easy-to-use R package HDtweedie, and is shown to compute the whole solution path very efficiently. Simulations are conducted to study the variable selection and model fitting performance of various lasso methods for the Tweedie model. The modeling applications in risk segmentation of insurance business are illustrated by analysis of an auto insurance claim dataset.

Influential factors in crude oil price forecasting,"Abstract This paper identifies factors that are influential in forecasting crude oil prices. We consider six categories of factors (supply, demand, financial market, commodities market, speculative, and geopolitical) and test their significance in the context of estimating various forecasting models. We find that the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression method provides significant improvements in the forecasting accuracy of prices compared to alternative benchmarks. Relative to the no-change and futures-based models, LASSO forecasts at the 8-step ahead horizon yield significant reductions in Mean Squared Prediction Error (MSPE), with MSPE ratios of 0.873 and 0.898, respectively. We also document substantial improvements in forecasting performance of the factor-based model that employs only a subset of variables chosen by LASSO. Finally, the time-varying nature of the relationship between factors and oil prices is used to explain recent movements in crude oil prices.",2017,Energy Economics
Video-to-Shot Tag Propagation by Graph Sparse Group Lasso,"Traditional approaches to video tagging are designed to propagate tags at the same level, such as assigning the tags of training videos (or shots) to the test videos (or shots), such as generating tags for the test video when the training videos are associated with the tags at the video-level or assigning tags to the test shot when given a collection of annotated shots. This paper focuses on automatical shot tagging given a collection of videos with the tags at the video-level. In other words, we aim to assign specific tags from the training videos to the test shot. The paper solves the V2S issue by assigning the test shot with the tags deriving from parts of the tags in a part of training videos. To achieve the goal, the paper first proposes a novel Graph Sparse Group Lasso (shorted for GSGL) model to linearly reconstruct the visual feature of the test shot with the visual features of the training videos, i.e., finding the correlation between the test shot and the training videos. The paper then proposes a new tagging propagation rule to assign the video-level tags to the test shot by the learnt correlations. Moreover, to effectively build the reconstruction model, the proposed GSGL simultaneously takes several constraints into account, such as the inter-group sparsity, the intra-group sparsity, the temporal-spatial prior knowledge in the training videos and the local structure of the test shot. Extensive experiments on public video datasets are conducted, which clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for dealing with the video-to-shot tag propagation.",2013,IEEE Transactions on Multimedia
On Quentin Meillassoux and the Problem of Evil,"Abstract The problem of evil and the injustice it brings out has a long history in western philosophy and it has been one of the core arguments against the existence of God as an all-powerful and all-good Being. In a number of texts Meillassoux agrees with this line of argument, but he also argues that atheism fails to take into account the injustice of evil. His central thesis is that while the existence of evil discounts the existence of the â€˜revealedâ€™ God, he proposes a messianic vision where we can hope for the arrival of a God who will have the power to rectify the injustices that have been committed. To justify the possible arrival of such a being Meillassoux describes the world as a contingent place such that things happen without a necessary reason. This explains why, in the past, novel and inexplicable situations (â€˜adventsâ€™) have arisen and, possibly, others might arise. One such possibility is the arrival of a God who will redeem all the injustices suffered within the world.",2020,Open Theology
Prediction of mortality risk in victims of violent crimes.,"BACKGROUND
To predict mortality risk in victims of violent crimes based on individual injury diagnoses and other information available in health care registries.


METHODS
Data from the Swedish hospital discharge registry and the cause of death registry were combined to identify 15,000 hospitalisations or prehospital deaths related to violent crimes. The ability of patient characteristics, injury type and severity, and cause of injury to predict death was modelled using conventional, Lasso, or Bayesian logistic regression in a development dataset and evaluated in a validation dataset.


RESULTS
Of 14,470 injury events severe enough to cause death or hospitalization 3.7% (556) died before hospital admission and 0.5% (71) during the hospital stay. The majority (76%) of hospital survivors had minor injury severity and most (67%) were discharged from hospital within 1day. A multivariable model with age, sex, the ICD-10 based injury severity score (ICISS), cause of injury, and major injury region provided predictions with very good discrimination (C-index=0.99) and calibration. Adding information on major injury interactions further improved model performance. Modeling individual injury diagnoses did not improve predictions over the combined ICISS score.


CONCLUSIONS
Mortality risk after violent crimes can be accurately estimated using administrative data. The use of Bayesian regression models provides meaningful risk assessment with more straightforward interpretation of uncertainty of the prediction, potentially also on the individual level. This can aid estimation of incidence trends over time and comparisons of outcome of violent crimes for injury surveillance and in forensic medicine.",2017,Forensic science international
A plasma metabolite panel as biomarkers for early primary breast cancer detection.,"In recent years, metabolites have attracted substantial attention as promising novel biomarkers of various diseases. However, breast cancer plasma metabolite studies are still in their infancy. Here, we investigated the potential of metabolites to serve as minimally invasive, early detection markers of primary breast cancer. We profiled metabolites extracted from the plasma of primary breast cancer patients and healthy controls using tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS and FIA-MS/MS). Two metabolites were found to be upregulated, while 16 metabolites were downregulated in primary breast cancer patients compared to healthy controls in both the training and validation cohorts. A panel of seven metabolites was selected by LASSO regression analysis. This panel could differentiate primary breast cancer patients from healthy controls, with an AUC of 0.87 (95% CI: 0.81â€‰~â€‰0.92) in the training cohort and an AUC ofâ€‰0.80 (95% CI: 0.71â€‰~â€‰0.87) in the validation cohort. These significantly differentiated metabolites are mainly involved in the amino acid metabolism and breast cancer cell growth pathways. In conclusion, using a metabolomics approach, we identified metabolites that have potential value for development of a multimarker blood-based test to complement and improve early breast cancer detection. The panel identified herein might be part of a prescreening tool, especially for younger women or for closely observing women with certain risks, to facilitate decision making regarding which individuals should undergo further diagnostic tests. In the future, the combination of metabolites and other blood-based molecular marker sets, such as DNA methylation, microRNA, and cell-free DNA mutation markers, will be an attractive option.",2019,International journal of cancer
On the Oracle Property of the Adaptive Lasso in Stationary and Nonstationary Autoregressions,"We show that the Adaptive LASSO is oracle efficient in stationary and non-stationary autoregressions. This means that it estimates parameters consistently, selects the correct sparsity pattern, and estimates the coefficients belonging to the relevant variables at the same asymptotic efficiency as if only these had been included in the model from the outset. In particular this implies that it is able to discriminate between stationary and non-stationary autoregressions and it thereby constitutes an addition to the set of unit root tests. However, it is also shown that the Adaptive LASSO has no power against shrinking alternatives of the form c/T where c is a constant and T the sample size if it is tuned to perform consistent model selection. We show that if the Adaptive LASSO is tuned to performed conservative model selection it has power even against shrinking alternatives of this form. Monte Carlo experiments reveal that the Adaptive LASSO performs particularly well in the presence of a unit root while being at par with its competitors in the stationary setting.",2012,
Patient Surface Model and Internal Anatomical Landmarks Embedding,"The patient surface model has shown to be a useful asset to improve existing diagnostic and interventional tasks in a clinical environment. For example, in combination with RGB-D cameras, a patient surface model can be used to automate and accelerate the diagnostic imaging workflow, manage patient dose, and provide navigation assistance. A shortcoming of todayâ€™s patient surface models, however, is that, internal anatomical landmarks are not present. In this paper, we introduce a method to estimate internal anatomical landmarks based on the surface model of a patient. Our method relies on two major steps. First, we fit a template surface model is to a segmented surface of a CT dataset with annotated internal landmarks using keypoint and feature descriptor based rigid alignment and atlas-based non-rigid registration. In a second step, we find for each internal landmark a neighborhood on the template surface and learn a generalized linear embedding between neighboring surface vertices in the template and the internal landmark. We trained and evaluated our method using cross-validation in 20 datasets over 50 internal landmarks. We compared the performance of four different generalized linear models. The best mean estimation error over all the landmarks was achieved using the lasso regression method with a mean error of 12.19 Â± 6.98 mm.",2018,
D-Trace precision matrix estimator with eigenvalue control,"The estimation of a precision matrix has an important role in several research fields. In high-dimensional settings, one of the most prominent approaches to estimate the precision matrix is the É­â‚ (Lasso) norm penalized convex optimization. This framework guarantees the sparsity of the estimated precision matrix. However, it does not control the eigenspectrum of the obtained estimator, and, moreover, it shrinks the largest eigenvalues of the estimated precision matrix. In this paper, we focus on D-trace precision matrix methodology. We propose imposing a negative trace penalization on the objective function of the D-trace approach, aimed to control the eigenvalues. Through extensive numerical analysis, using simulated and real datasets, we show the advantageous performance of our proposed methodology.",2016,

"The Jurassic-Cretaceous transition of the Fararp-1 core, southern Sweden: Sedimentological and phytological indications of climate change","The 116m deep Fararp-1 core drilled in the Vomb Trough in southernmost Sweden is dated by integrated terrestrial and marine palynostratigraphy. The lower part of the succession (ca 84 m) encompasses uppermost Jurassic to lowermost Cretaceous (uppermost Tithonian to Valanginian) strata. An unconformity separates the Valanginian strata from an overlying ca 1 m thick interval of upper Albian to Cenomanian Arnager Greensand Formation. The uppermost part of the core is a repetitive succession of lowermost Cretaceous sediments. During the Jurassic-Cretaceous U/K) transition NW Europe was located in mid latitudes, and comprised an archipelago of large and small islands separated by deeper grabens and epicontinental seaways that connected the Boreal Sea to the north with the warmer Tethys Ocean to the south. Boundary strata in England, France, the Netherlands and Germany are characterised by relatively prominent climatic change from arid/semi arid to subhumid/humid conditions. Southernmost Sweden was located on the margin of a large landmass comprising most of the Fennoscandian Shield bordering a large epicontinental sea to the west. By combining sedimentology, clay mineralogy and palynofacies the Tithonian to Valanginian cored succession of the Fararp-1 core provides complementary information on how marginal deposits from the eastern part of the epicontinental sea reflect the climatological and environmental changes observed in other parts of NW Europe. The Fararp-1 core shows that during the Tithonian to earliest Berriasian deposition took place in a terrestrial but near-marine depositional setting, in coastal lakes or lagoons with little marine influence. A dry climatic regime favoured stagnant water conditions with common algal blooms of primarily Bonyococcus and zygnemataceae. Palynofacies and sedimentology indicate limited transport of freshwater and material to the basin. The stagnant depositional environment was terminated by a marine flooding in the early Berriasian. During the remaining Berriasian and the early Valanginian conditions shifted between near marine and marine settings in a dynamic coastal environment, similar to contemporaneous assemblages reported from the Danish Island of Bornholm. A shift in clay mineralogy, from a dominance of 10 A minerals to increasing amounts of mixed layer and kaolinite indicates a change to more humid conditions in the latest Tithonian. Cheirolepidacean pollen (Classopollis) are present but never common in the cored succession, and a similar conspicuous decrease of these pollen, as previously reported from England, Germany and France, is not evident in the Fararp-1 core. Instead a subsequent shift in both palynofacies and palynoflora, marked by an increase in abundance of heavy terrigenous material, i.e. wood and coal particles, upland pollen grains and reworked palynomorphs is also observed in the uppermost Tithonian-lowermost Berriasian interval. At the same level spores and pollen classified as warmer/drier elements decrease in abundance. This is interpreted as representing a shift to more humid climatic conditions with increased runoff from the hinterland. Thus, the combined sedimentological and palynological data from the Fararp-1 core suggest that climatic conditions in the area changed from more seasonally dry (semi-arid) to more humid (semi-humid) across the J/K boundary (latest Tithonian to earliest Berriasian) and hence earlier than the mid-Berriasian climatic shift recorded from e.g. England and the Netherlands.

Gli effetti dell'interferenza valanghiva: il caso della valanga catastrofica di Les Thoules - Valsavarenche (AO),"Si presenta la procedura utilizzata per la stima delle pressioni d'impatto di valanga di neve sulle costruzioni: una back-analysis strutturale dei danni. Come caso studio di riferimento, si considera l'evento del dicembre 2008 accaduto a Les Thoules in Valsa- varenche (AO) che provoco la distruzione o il danneggiamento di dodici edifici e delle reti di mobilita, elettriche e telefoniche, che comportarono l'isolamento della frazio- ne per parecchi giorni. La procedura utilizzata per la stima del range delle pressioni d'impatto indotte da un evento valanghivo si divide in due parti: la prima di rilievo danni e informazioni, e la seconda di analisi strutturale a ritroso dei meccanismi di collasso e dei relativi danni indotti a edifici scelti. In particolare, il lavoro qui presentato si concentra su quattro edifici: due parzialmen- te danneggiati e due completamente distrutti. Partendo dall'analisi della dinamica dell'evento, si introduce la fase conoscitiva delle strutture danneggiate, eseguita consultando gli elaborati progettuali e la documentazione fotografica degli edifici, e il rilievo fotografico/strutturale dei danni mediante una scheda appositamente realiz- zata. Dopo una breve descrizione dei danni indotti, si riporta la back-analysis basata sulla distribuzione dei detriti e sui meccanismi di collasso, e si presenta la stima della pressione dinamica della valanga, della velocita del flusso e della direzione d'impatto.

Large Vector Auto Regressions,"One popular approach for nonstructural economic and financial forecasting is to include a large number of economic and financial variables, which has been shown to lead to significant improvements for forecasting, for example, by the dynamic factor models. A challenging issue is to determine which variables and (their) lags are relevant, especially when there is a mixture of serial correlation (temporal dynamics), high dimensional (spatial) dependence structure and moderate sample size (relative to dimensionality and lags). To this end, an integrated solution that addresses these three challenges simultaneously is appealing. We study the large vector auto regressions here with three types of estimates. We treat each variable's own lags different from other variables' lags, distinguish various lags over time, and is able to select the variables and lags simultaneously. We first show the consequences of using Lasso type estimate directly for time series without considering the temporal dependence. In contrast, our proposed method can still produce an estimate as efficient as an oracle under such scenarios. The tuning parameters are chosen via a data driven ""rolling scheme"" method to optimize the forecasting performance. A macroeconomic and financial forecasting problem is considered to illustrate its superiority over existing estimators.",2011,arXiv: Machine Learning
