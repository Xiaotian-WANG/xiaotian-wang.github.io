Identification of molecular correlations of RBM8A with autophagy in Alzheimer's disease,"Our previous studies revealed RBM8A may play a role in various progressive neurological diseases. The present study aimed to explore the role of RBM8A in Alzheimer's disease (AD). RBM8A is significantly down-regulated in AD. Interestingly, 9186 differentially expressed genes are overlapped from comparisons of AD versus control and RBM8A-low versus RBM8A-high. Weight gene correlation analysis was performed and 9 functional modules were identified. Modules positively correlated with AD and RBM8A-low are significantly involved in the RAP1 signaling pathway, PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, hematopoietic cell lineage, autophagy and APELIN signaling pathway. Fifteen genes (RBM8A, RHBDF2, TNFRSF10B, ACP1, ANKRD39, CA10, CAMK4, CBLN4, LOC284214, NOVA1, PAK1, PPEF1, RGS4, TCEB1 and TMEM118) are identified as hub genes, and the hub gene-based LASSO model can accurately predict the occurrence of AD (AUC = 0.948). Moreover, the RBM8A-module-pathway network was constructed, and low expression of RBM8A down-regulates multiple module genes, including FIP200, Beclin 1, NRBF2, VPS15 and ATG12, which composes key complexes of autophagy. Thus, our study supports that low expression of RBM8A correlates with the decrease of the components of key complexes in autophagy, which could potentially contribute to pathophysiological changes of AD.",2019,Aging (Albany NY)
Approximate Steepest Coordinate Descent,"We propose a new selection rule for the coordinate selection in coordinate descent methods for huge-scale optimization. The efficiency of this novel scheme is provably better than the efficiency of uniformly random selection, and can reach the efficiency of steepest coordinate descent (SCD), enabling an acceleration of a factor of up to $n$, the number of coordinates. In many practical applications, our scheme can be implemented at no extra cost and computational efficiency very close to the faster uniform selection. Numerical experiments with Lasso and Ridge regression show promising improvements, in line with our theoretical guarantees.",2017,ArXiv
Valutazione della vulnerabilitÃ  sismica di capannoni industriali prefabbricati attraverso l'analisi dinamica incrementale (IDA) = Seismic vulnerability assessment of precast industrial facilities through incremental dynamic analysis (IDA),"Tra tutte le tipologie di edifici industriali presenti in Italia, i capannoni prefabbricati in calcestruzzo armato rappresentano una delle soluzioni piu ricorrenti. Tali strutture sono composte da elementi prefabbricati (travi e colonne) spesso assemblati con collegamenti a secco. A seguito del terremoto dellâ€™Emilia del 2012 la maggior parte di queste strutture ha presentato ha mostrato significativa vulnerabilita nei confronti delle azioni sismiche. Tale vulnerabilita e causata principalmente da due fenomeni: la perdita dâ€™appoggio della trave rispetto alla colonna a causa dellâ€™assenza di ritegni traslazionali e dal raggiungimento della capacita deformativa rotazionale alla base delle colonne. La tesi affronta la valutazione della vulnerabilita sismica di queste tipologie strutturale tramite lâ€™impiego dellâ€™analisi dinamica incrementale (IDA). Per eseguire tali analisi e stato modellato un portale in Opensees; il modello tiene conto delle non linearita geometriche (P-delta) e meccaniche, tramite elementi a fibre â€œforce based elementâ€ e opportuni legami tensioni-deformazioni per calcestruzzo confinato e non confinato ed acciaio. Il collegamento trave-pilastro e stato modellato con elementi â€œflat slider bearingâ€ consentendo di simulare la forza dâ€™attrito tra trave e pilastro e le relative variazioni dovute al sisma verticale. Le analisi dinamiche incrementali sono state svolte svolte sottoponendo il modello ad un set di ventidue accelerogrammi opportunamente scalati rispetto allâ€™ordinata spettrale dello spettro di risposta elastico rappresentativo della pericolosita sismica del sito di Mirandola. Vengono monitorati lo spostamento in testa al pilastro (e di conseguenza il drift) e lo spostamento relativo tra trave e pilastro. Le analisi vengono interrotte al raggiungimento del primo meccanismo di collasso. Sono state investigate diverse geometrie e per ognuna diversi coefficienti dâ€™attrito. Dalle analisi incrementali dinamiche si ricavano poi le curve di fragilita fissando volta per volta diversi parametri ingegneristici di controllo. Tramite queste curve si stimano, per le diverse geometrie, i benefici rispetto al collasso per perdita dâ€™appoggio di un aumento dello spostamento relativo tra trave e pilastro possibile. Viene infine proposta una possibile soluzione per la mitigazione degli effetti del sisma verticale sulla trave.",2018,

Covariance Estimation: The GLM and Regularization Perspectives,"Finding an unconstrained and statistically interpretable reparameterization of a covariance matrix is still an open problem in statistics. Its solution is of central importance in covariance estimation, particularly in the recent high-dimensional data environment where enforcing the positive-definiteness constraint could be computationally expensive. We provide a survey of the progress made in modeling covariance matrices from two relatively complementary perspectives: (1) generalized linear models (GLM) or parsimony and use of covariates in low dimensions, and (2) regularization or sparsity for high-dimensional data. An emerging, unifying and powerful trend in both perspectives is that of reducing a covariance estimation problem to that of estimating a sequence of regression problems. We point out several instances of the regression-based formulation. A notable case is in sparse estimation of a precision matrix or a Gaussian graphical model leading to the fast graphical LASSO algorithm. Some advantages and limitations of the regression-based Cholesky decomposition relative to the classical spectral (eigenvalue) and variance-correlation decompositions are highlighted. The former provides an unconstrained and statistically interpretable reparameterization, and guarantees the positive-definiteness of the estimated covariance matrix. It reduces the unintuitive task of covariance estimation to that of modeling a sequence of regressions at the cost of imposing an a priori order among the variables. Elementwise regularization of the sample covariance matrix such as banding, tapering and thresholding has desirable asymptotic properties and the sparse estimated covariance matrix is positive definite with probability tending to one for large samples and dimensions.",2011,Statistical Science
Multi-sensor joint kernel sparse representation for personnel detection,"In this paper, we propose a novel nonlinear technique for multi-sensor classification, which relies on sparsely representing a test sample in terms of all the training samples in a feature space induced by a kernel function. Our approach simultaneously takes into account the correlations as well as the complementary information between the homogeneous/heterogeneous sensors, while also considering the joint sparsity within each sensor's multiple observations in the feature space. This approach can be seen as a generalized model for representing a multi-task and multivariate Lasso in the feature space, where the data from all the sensors representing the same physical events are jointly represented by a sparse linear combination of the training data. Extensive experiments are conducted on real data sets and the results are compared with the conventional discriminative classifiers to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method in the application of automatic border patrol, where it is required to discriminate between human and animal footsteps.",2012,2012 Proceedings of the 20th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)
Using GEV-regression to improve accuracy of probability of default in low default portfolios,"Calculating probability of default (PD) for low default portfolios in a 
statistically sound way can be a daunting task. For groups of coun- 
terparties with no or few defaults, e.g. large corporates and nancial 
institutions, standard approaches like logistic regression fail due to the 
low number of events. In this thesis, a dierent approach is used. The 
logit function in logistic regression is replaced with the inverse of the 
Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution function, called GEV- 
regression. 
The LASSO regression technique provides a way to automatically 
nd the attributes that contain the most information in the data by 
including all attributes, and adding a penalty for complexity in the 
maximization of the likelihood function for the parameters. This ap- 
proach is used to make a strong predictive model. Data was provided 
by Danske Bank consisting of two portfolios of anonymized counterpar- 
ties. PD was calculated for each observation, and the accuracy of the 
predictions using GEV-regression and logistic regression was compared. 
The purpose of this thesis is twofold. First, to use the data provided 
to create a model for probability of default, using LASSO regression. 
Second, to investigate if GEV-regression is suitable for calculating PD 
for low default portfolios. 
The analysis suggests that it is possible to make a good predictive 
model using LASSO regression. It also supports that GEV-regression 
is a viable option to logistic regression, as it had a similar accuracy. It 
does not however support that GEV-regression is better than logistic 
regression in low default portfolios. Further studies with more data is 
needed to conclude which methodology is the optimal one.",2014,

High-Dimensional Classification Models with Applications to Email Targeting,"Email communication is valuable for any modern company, since it offers an easy mean for spreading important information or advertising new products, features or offers and much more. To be able to identify which customers that would be interested in certain information would make it possible to significantly improve a company's email communication and as such avoiding that customers start ignoring messages and creating unnecessary badwill. This thesis focuses on trying to target customers by applying statistical learning methods to historical data provided by the music streaming company Spotify.An important aspect was the high-dimensionality of the data, creating certain demands on the applied methods. A binary classification model was created, where the target was whether a customer will open the email or not. Two approaches were used for trying to target the costumers, logistic regression, both with and without regularization, and random forest classifier, for their ability to handle the high-dimensionality of the data. Performance accuracy of the suggested models were then evaluated on both a training set and a test set using statistical validation methods, such as cross-validation, ROC curves and lift charts.The models were studied under both large-sample and high-dimensional scenarios. The high-dimensional scenario represents when the number of observations, N, is of the same order as the number of features, p and the large sample scenario represents when N â‰« p. Lasso-based variable selection was performed for both these scenarios, to study the informative value of the features.This study demonstrates that it is possible to greatly improve the opening rate of emails by targeting users, even in the high dimensional scenario. The results show that increasing the amount of training data over a thousand fold will only improve the performance marginally. Rather efficient customer targeting can be achieved by using a few highly informative variables selected by the Lasso regularization.",2015,
The Use of Textual Theories to Explain Agreements of Matthew and Luke Against Mark,"The view that textual corruption is the right explanation for some of the agreements of Matthew and Luke against Mark is sound, but a great deal of detailed work remains to be done. This is partly because in a stylistic approach to the text this problem cannot be separated from the wider task of establishing the original texts of the gospels; in the process of examining the agreements many other readings are questioned incidentally. The task is immense because each agreement must be considered on its own merits, and complex because often more than one explanation is possible. The attempts of Glasson and Brown to discover for the use by Matthew and Luke of a different text of Mark are not satisfactory. An eclectic approach such as Turner pioneered is likely to show that the right explanation for the agreements is still independent stylistic improvement and textual corruption. Keywords: Brown; Glasson; gospels; Luke; Mark; Matthew; textual corruption; Turner",1976,
Adaptive Group Sparse Multitask Learning via Trace Lasso Sulin,"In multi-task learning (MTL), tasks are learned jointly so that information among related tasks is shared and utilized to help improve generalization for each individual task. A major challenge in MTL is how to selectively choose what to share among tasks. Ideally, only related tasks should share information with each other. In this paper, we propose a new MTL method that can adaptively group correlated tasks into clusters and share information among the correlated tasks only. Our method is based on the assumption that each task parameter is a linear combination of other tasksâ€™ and the coefficients of the linear combination are active only if there is relatedness between the two tasks. Through introducing trace Lasso penalty on these coefficients, our method is able to adaptively select the subset of coefficients with respect to the tasks that are correlated to the task. Our model frees the process of determining task clustering structure as used in the literature. Efficient optimization method based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is developed to solve the problem. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in terms of clustering related tasks and generalization performance.",2017,

Universal low-rank matrix recovery from Pauli measurements,"We study the problem of reconstructing an unknown matrix M of rank r and dimension d using O(rd poly log d) Pauli measurements. This has applications in quantum state tomography, and is a non-commutative analogue of a well-known problem in compressed sensing: recovering a sparse vector from a few of its Fourier coefficients. 
We show that almost all sets of O(rd log^6 d) Pauli measurements satisfy the rank-r restricted isometry property (RIP). This implies that M can be recovered from a fixed (""universal"") set of Pauli measurements, using nuclear-norm minimization (e.g., the matrix Lasso), with nearly-optimal bounds on the error. A similar result holds for any class of measurements that use an orthonormal operator basis whose elements have small operator norm. Our proof uses Dudley's inequality for Gaussian processes, together with bounds on covering numbers obtained via entropy duality.",2011,
On the resolution of The LASSO-based DOA estimation method,"This paper investigates the consistency of the LASSO-based DOA estimation of the narrow-band signals in infinitely high SNR. Such a method provides a robust and accurate approximation of the Maximum Likelihood estimation. However, as we show, unlike the standard techniques such as subspace methods the LASSO-based estimation is generally not consistent in high SNRs. In return, considering the true DOA's, we show that the method is consistent for certain configuration of the sources. This approach leads us to relate such a conditional consistency to the resolution concept. We next give a condition to verify the consistency of a given set of directions and simplify it to a computationally fast equivalent algorithm. The results show that the resolution in infinitely high SNR case for m sensors decreases by speed 1 over m.",2011,2011 International ITG Workshop on Smart Antennas
Identification and Validation of Immune-Related Gene Prognostic Signature for Hepatocellular Carcinoma,"Immune-related genes (IRGs) have been identified as critical drivers of the initiation and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study is aimed at constructing an IRG signature for HCC and validating its prognostic value in clinical application. The prognostic signature was developed by integrating multiple IRG expression data sets from TCGA and GEO databases. The IRGs were then combined with clinical features to validate the robustness of the prognostic signature through bioinformatics tools. A total of 1039 IRGs were identified in the 657 HCC samples. Subsequently, the IRGs were subjected to univariate Cox regression and LASSO Cox regression analyses in the training set to construct an IRG signature comprising nine immune-related gene pairs (IRGPs). Functional analyses revealed that the nine IRGPs were associated with tumor immune mechanisms, including cell proliferation, cell-mediated immunity, and tumorigenesis signal pathway. Concerning the overall survival rate, the IRGPs distinctly grouped the HCC samples into the high- and low-risk groups. Also, we found that the risk score based on nine IRGPs was related to clinical and pathologic factors and remained a valid independent prognostic signature after adjusting for tumor TNM, grade, and grade in multivariate Cox regression analyses. The prognostic value of the nine IRGPs was further validated by forest and nomogram plots, which revealed that it was superior to the tumor TNM, grade, and stage. Our findings suggest that the nine-IRGP signature can be effective in determining the disease outcomes of HCC patients.",2020,Journal of Immunology Research
Utilidad clÃ­nica de la expresiÃ³n de marcadores inmunohistoquÃ­micos en el tumor vesical urotelial papilar sin invasiÃ³n de la muscular propia (pTa/pT1) grado 2,"Introduccion: El tumor vesical urotelial papilar sin invasion de la muscular propia (TVU NoMinv) es uno de los tumores urologicos mas frecuentes. A pesar del tratamiento, presenta una elevada tasa de recidiva y progresion. El hallazgo de factores pronosticos que nos indiquen su comportamiento clinico es fundamental para estratificar riesgos y ayudar al diseno de una estrategia terapeutica. Las variables anatomoclinicas clasicamente utilizadas no son del todo precisas en la evaluacion pronostica. La nueva clasificacion histologica de la OMS 2004 tampoco ha conseguido este objetivo, presentando una importante variabilidad interobservador. Por ello, esta en auge el estudio de marcadores moleculares, que precisen el comportamiento clinico y biologico de estos tumores. El principal problema de los estudios que han evaluado su utilidad es la heterogeneidad en la metodologia empleada, ya que no se centran en un tipo especifico de tumor. Por otra parte, dentro de los TVU NoMinv el tumor de grado 2 (G2) (OMS 1973) es el paradigma de comportamiento clinico incierto. Objetivos: Conocer la utilidad pronostica de una bateria de marcadores inmunohistoquimicos en el TVU NoMinv G2 con respecto a los periodos libres de recidiva, progresion y mortalidad cancer especifica. Material y metodos: Estudio analitico, observacional y ambispectivo de 213 pacientes con tumor vesical primario no musculoinvasivo G2. Estudio transversal de las muestras procesadas en parafina de dicho tumor, determinando la expresion inmunohistoquimica de 26 marcadores moleculares correspondientes a las distintas rutas oncologicas. Se construyeron mapas tridimiensionales para su representacion. Se realizo un analisis multidimensional de los datos mediante el uso de regresion logistica penalizada ?Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator? (LASSO) y bosques aleatorios de supervivencia ?Random survival forest? (RSF). Se efectuo un analisis de supervivencia mediante curvas Kaplan-Meier (log Rank test). Se generaron grupos de riesgo con las variables seleccionadas, comparandolos con la probabilidad de recidiva y progresion calculadas segun las tablas de la EORTC.. Resultados: La media de seguimiento y de la edad fue de 58 Â± 33,5 meses y 69,5 Â± 10,4 anos. Los porcentajes de recidiva, progresion y mortalidad cancer-especifica (CaEsp) fueron del 54,5%, 17,4%, 11,3%, respectivamente. Un 61% de la muestra correspondio a tumores T1 y un 71% a un alto grado OMS 2004. Las variables seleccionadas por LASSO y RSF influyentes en la aparicion de tiempos de supervivencia cortos fueron la siguientes. Tiempo libre (TL) de recidiva: numero de tumores >1 , un aumento en la expresion nuclear de Ki67, VEGFR2 y Ciclina D1 y una debil expresion citoplasmatica de CtIP y p16INK4a. TL de progresion: tumor multicentrico, expresion de Ki 67 y Survivina nuclear. TL de mortalidad CaEsp: edad >=70 anos, estadio T1, expresion nuclear de GAPDH, Survivina y p53. Los grupos de riesgo generados han sido mas efectivos en cuanto al analisis de supervivencia que la estratificacion segun la EORTC o mediante la clasificacion segun estadio/grado (p<0,005). Conclusiones: La expresion inmunohistoquimica de varios marcadores moleculares influye en el pronostico clinico de los pacientes con TVU NoMinv G2, siendo posible su uso en conjunto con variables anatomoclinicas para generar grupos de riesgo.",2015,
Primary lymphoma of skeletal muscle.,"A 16-year-old girl presented with persistent pain and medial knee . swelling 6 weeks after a sports injury. Physical examination revealed no effusion, instability, or locking of the knee, but a mass was found in the medial thigh with skin induration. MR imaging showed enlargement of the sartorius muscle with infiltration of the surrounding fascial planes; the lesion had low signal intensity compared with that of uninvolved muscle on TI-weighted images and high signal intensity on T2-weighted images (Fig. 1A). CT showed involvement ofthe entire sartorius muscle from origin to insertion; allenuation was similar to that of uninvolved muscle (Fig. lB). A needle biopsy showed sheets of dishesive malignant cells with irregular nuclei, prominent nucleoli. and scant cytoplasm (Fig. IC). Single necrotic cells and mitotic figures were plentiful. lmmunohistochemistry was positive for leukocyte common antigen and T-cellassociated antigens. The final clinicopathologic diagnosis was anaplastic large cell lymphoma ofT-cell origin. primary to the sartorius muscle. Lymphoma arising in skeletal muscle is rare, comprising perhaps 0.5% of non-Hodgkinâ€™s lymphomas that arise in extranodal sites [1]. Lymphoma spreads by infiltration of individual malignantcells that lack extracellular stroma and intercellular junctions, resulting in diffuse enlargement of involved structures and a pattern of growth that does not respect fascial boundaries. Therefore, involvement of more than one muscle compartment over a long segment of the extremity is typical [2]. Radiography is usually unremarkable, but CT and MR imaging show diffuse enlargement with or without infiltration of the adjacent fat planes. Attenuation on Cf is similar or slightly decreased compared with that of uninvolved muscle [2, 3]; enhancement after IV contrast injection may be inapparent [4]. Signal intensity on MR imaging is homogeneous and similarto that ofskeletal muscle on TI-weighted images but increased on 12-weighted images; enhancement after IV gadolinium is homogeneous [2, 3, 5]. Sonography shows an ill-defined hypoechoic mass with coarsening of fibroadipose septa and swelling of muscle bundles [6]. The treatment of choice for non-Hodgkinâ€™s lymphoma involving skeletal muscle depends on the specific histology and anatomic extent of the lesion; treatment typically involves chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or surgery, alone or in combination [1, 6].",1999,AJR.

Multiplexed LC-ESI-MRM-MS-based Assay for Identification of Coronary Artery Disease Biomarkers in Human Plasma.,"PURPOSE
A highly-multiplexed LC-ESI-multiple reaction monitoring-MS-based assay is developed for the identification of coronary artery disease (CAD) biomarkers in human plasma.


EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
The assay is used to measure 107 stable isotope labeled peptide standards and native peptides from 64 putative biomarkers of cardiovascular diseases in tryptic digests of plasma from subjects with (n = 70) and without (n = 45) angiographic evidence of CAD and no subsequent cardiovascular mortality during follow-up.


RESULTS
Extensive computational and statistical analysis reveals six plasma proteins associated with CAD, namely apolipoprotein CII, C reactive protein, CD5 antigen-like, fibronectin, inter alpha trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H1, and protein S. The identified proteins are combined into a LASSO-logistic score with high classification performance (cross-validated area under the curve = 0.74). When combined with a separate score computed from markers currently used in the clinic with similar performance, the area under the receiver operating curve increases to 0.84. Similar results are observed in an independent set of subjects (n = 87).


CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE
If externally validated, the assay and identified biomarkers can improve CAD risk stratification.",2019,Proteomics. Clinical applications
"Numerically derived evidence for late-Holocene climate change and its impact on human presence in the southwest Taurus Mountains, Turkey","A well-dated pollen diagram from Gravgaz marsh, near the archaeological site of Sagalassos (western Taurus Mountains, Turkey), provides the first detailed record of vegetation change in southwest Turkey during the last two millennia. A newly developed numerical analysis disentangles the climatic and anthropogenic influences on vegetation and reveals for the first time for southwest Turkey the timing and influence of late-Holocene climate change. Results show that sudden vegetation changes, driven by changes in moisture availability, co-occurred with well-defined European climate shifts. A trend towards dry conditions, from c. ad 640 to 940, coincides with the cold early Middle Ages in Europe. During this period, human presence in the region diminished and agricultural activity switched focus from crop cultivation to pastoralism while signs of cereal cultivation temporarily ceased. This period was followed by a return to moister conditions from ad 940 to 1280, coinciding with the â€˜Medieval Climate Anomalyâ€™...",2012,The Holocene
Juegos tradicionales en el desarrollo de habilidades.,"The research project deals with traditional games in the development of skills, which addresses as a central problem, the poor inclusion of this type of games in the educational environment, as an enhancing instrument for the development of skills in students, because it has been shown that in the institution the students have a deficient development of the cognitive, motor and affective abilities of their age, for which the use of traditional games is proposed as methodological strategies.

Predicting tomato crop yield from weather data using statistical learning techniques,"Predicting crop harvest quantities accurately is important in managing a farming enterprise effectively, facilitating decisions regarding crop management, allocation of resources, anticipated delivery times and quantities to customers and produce pricing, to name but a few. The aim of this project is to develop statistical models for predicting harvest quantity of field-grown crops on a commercial tomato farm in South Africa using weather data. Planting and harvest data for a seven-year period were provided by the tomato farm, while daily and 10-daily weather data for the same period were obtained from a nearby weather station and from satellite data. The data sets were cleaned, and the time series data were summarised in the form of a single summary statistic for each weather variable over the growing period of each crop. Median and total harvest density (t/ha) were each modelled using multiple linear regression, the lasso, regression trees, bagged regression trees, random forests and boosted regression trees. All of the crop and weather variables turned out to be informative in predicting tomato yield, with the average of the daily average wind speed and the average of the daily maximum relative humidity readings over the cropsâ€™ growing periods emerging as the most important predictors of median and total harvest density, respectively. Random forests modelled median harvest density the most accurately with an estimated mean absolute prediction error of 0.37 t/ha, while bagged regression trees modelled total harvest density the most accurately with a mean absolute prediction error of 12.67 t/ha. The model parameter estimators of all of the modelling techniques tended to have low variances, and the sizes of the prediction errors are most likely due to factors such as the absence of important predictors (soil fertility, irrigation regimes, etc.) from the models and the summary of the weather time series over the cropsâ€™ growing periods into single values. ii Stellenbosch University https://scholar.sun.ac.za",2017,
Fishing Economic Growth Determinants Using Bayesian Elastic Nets,"We propose a method to deal simultaneously with model uncertainty and correlated regressors in linear regression models by combining elastic net specifications with a spike and slab prior. The estimation method nests ridge regression and the LASSO estimator and thus allows for a more flexible modelling framework than existing model averaging procedures. In particular, the proposed technique has clear advantages when dealing with datasets of (potentially highly) correlated regressors, a pervasive characteristic of the model averaging datasets used hitherto in the econometric literature. We apply our method to the dataset of economic growth determinants by Sala-i-Martin et al. (Sala-i-Martin, X., Doppelhofer, G., and Miller, R. I. (2004). Determinants of Long-Term Growth: A Bayesian Averaging of Classical Estimates (BACE) Approach. American Economic Review, 94: 813-835) and show that our procedure has superior out-of-sample predictive abilities as compared to the standard Bayesian model averaging methods currently used in the literature.

Graph Signal Processing-Based Imaging for Synthetic Aperture Radar,"In this letter, we propose graph signal processing-based imaging for synthetic aperture radar (SAR). Our method provides improved denoising and resolution enhancing capabilities, along with a reduction in computational complexity, by exploiting the concept of extended neighborhood in SAR images. We present a modified version of a fused least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) to cater for graph structure of the SAR image.

Predicting default of listed companies in mainland China via U-MIDAS Logit model with group lasso penalty,Abstract We introduce the group LASSO penalty into the U-MIDAS logistic regression context to develop a U-MIDAS-Logit-GL model. The U-MIDAS-Logit-GL model enables us to identify important variables at group level in high dimensional mixed frequency data analysis. We then apply it to a real-world application on studying the default of listed companies in mainland China. The U-MIDAS-Logit-GL model is able to effectively identify important determinants from high-frequency financial factors and low-frequency corporate governance profiles simultaneously. It also successfully predicts the default and outperforms the other competitive models for both in-sample and out-of-sample tests.,2020,Finance Research Letters

"Evaluation of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production in Escherichia coli clinical isolates from three hospitals in Luzon, Philippines","T he increased spread of pathogens producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) enzyme among members of family Enterobacteriaceae has been a serious problem worldwide. The absence of a fast and accurate detection protocol for ESBL producers had contributed to treatment failures in ESBLassociated infections. This study focused on the isolation of phenotypically ESBL-producing E. coli isolates from 3 hospitals in Luzon, Philippines. The availability of confirmed ESBLs is valuable in conducting experiments to gain information about ESBLs that are relevant to the identification of detection markers for these pathogens. Out of 119 pathogenic E. coli isolates from clinical samples such as urine, wound, body aspirates and blood, 37 (31%) were identified as suspected ESBLs using a preliminary test and 27 of the 37 suspected ESBLs were confirmed as ESBL producers based on a test referred to as double-disk synergy test. The highest percentage of ESBL-producing E. coli was obtained from urine specimens, while the lowest was from blood samples. All the ESBL-positive isolates exhibited resistance to cefotaxime and to levofloxacin. Co-resistance to other antibiotics like trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline and cefepime was also noted in some isolates. Susceptibility of ESBL-producers remains high towards carbapenems. These findings point to the urgent need to develop a fast and accurate detection protocol (including a molecular approach) for ESBLproducing pathogens.",2014,
Inference in High-Dimensional Linear Regression Models,"We introduce an asymptotically unbiased estimator for the full high-dimensional parameter vector in linear regression models where the number of variables exceeds the number of available observations. The estimator is accompanied by a closed-form expression for the covariance matrix of the estimates that is free of tuning parameters. This enables the construction of confidence intervals that are valid uniformly over the parameter vector. Estimates are obtained by using a scaled Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse as an approximate inverse of the singular empirical covariance matrix of the regressors. The approximation induces a bias, which is then corrected for using the lasso. Regularization of the pseudoinverse is shown to yield narrower confidence intervals under a suitable choice of the regularization parameter. The methods are illustrated in Monte Carlo experiments and in an empirical example where gross domestic product is explained by a large number of macroeconomic and financial indicators.",2017,arXiv: Statistics Theory

Variance Reduced Stochastic Gradient Descent with Sufficient Decrease,"The sufficient decrease technique has been widely used in deterministic optimization, even for non-convex optimization problems, such as line-search techniques. Motivated by those successes, we propose a novel sufficient decrease framework for a class of variance reduced stochastic gradient descent (VR-SGD) methods such as SVRG and SAGA. In order to make sufficient decrease for stochastic optimization, we design a new sufficient decrease criterion. We then introduce a coefficient \theta to satisfy the sufficient decrease property, which takes the decisions to shrink, expand or move in the opposite direction (i.e., \theta x for the variable x), and give two specific update rules for Lasso and ridge regression. Moreover, we analyze the convergence properties of our algorithms for strongly convex problems, which show that both of our algorithms attain linear convergence rates. We also provide the convergence guarantees of both of our algorithms for non-strongly convex problems. Our experimental results further verify that our algorithms achieve better performance than their counterparts.",2017,ArXiv
Drosophila Cappuccino alleles provide insight into formin mechanism and role in oogenesis,"During Drosophila development, the formin actin nucleator Cappuccino (Capu) helps build a cytoplasmic actin mesh throughout the oocyte. Loss of Capu leads to female sterility, presumably because polarity determinants fail to localize properly in the absence of the mesh. To gain deeper insight into how Capu builds this actin mesh, we systematically characterized seven capu alleles, which have missense mutations in Capu's formin homology 2 (FH2) domain. We report that all seven alleles have deleterious effects on fly fertility and the actin mesh in vivo but have strikingly different effects on Capu's biochemical activity in vitro. Using a combination of bulk and single- filament actin-assembly assays, we find that the alleles differentially affect Capu's ability to nucleate and processively elongate actin filaments. We also identify a unique ""loop"" in the lasso region of Capu's FH2 domain. Removing this loop enhances Capu's nucleation, elongation, and F-actin-bundling activities in vitro. Together our results on the loop and the seven missense mutations provides mechanistic insight into formin function in general and Capu's role in the Drosophila oocyte in particular.",2015,Molecular Biology of the Cell

Statistical Learning from Multimodal Genetic and Neuroimaging data for prediction of Alzheimer's Disease. (Apprentissage Statistique Ã  partir de DonnÃ©es Multimodales de GÃ©nÃ©tique et de Neuroimagerie pour la prÃ©diction de la Maladie d'Alzheimer),"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is nowadays the main cause of dementia in the world. It provokes memory and behavioural troubles in elderly people. The early diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease is an active topic of research. Three different types of data play a major role when it comes to its diagnosis: clinical tests, neuroimaging and genetics. The two first data bring informations concerning the patient's current state. On the contrary, genetic data help to identify whether a patient could develop AD in the future. Furthermore, during the past decade, researchers have created longitudinal dataset on A and important advances for processing and analyse of complex and high-dimensional data have been made. 
 
The first contribution of this thesis will be to study how to combine different modalities in order to increase their predictive power in the context of classification. We will focus on hierarchical models that capture potential interactions between modalities. Moreover, we will adequately modelled the structure of each modality (genomic structure, spatial structure for brain images), through the use of adapted penalties such as the ridge penalty for images and the group lasso penalty for genetic data. 
 
The second contribution of this thesis will be to explore models for predict the conversion date to Alzheimer's Disease for mild cognitive impairment subjects. Such problematic has been enhanced by the TADPOLE challenge. We will use the framework provided by survival analysis. Starting from basic models such as the Cox proportional hasard model, the additive Aalen model, and the log-logistic model, we will develop other survival models for combining different modalities, such as a multilevel log-logistic model or a multilevel Cox model.",2019,
Evaluation of Machine Learning Approaches for Android Energy Bugs Detection With Revision Commits,"Performances of smartphones are profoundly affected by battery life. Maximizing the amount of usage of energy is essential to extend battery life. However, developers might concentrate more on the functionality of applications while ignoring the energy bugs that drain the battery during the development process. There are no quantitative approaches to detect these energy bugs introduced in this fast-paced development process. In this paper, we employ a system-call-based approach to develop a power consumption model for Android devices. Data that measure the energy consumption of mobile devices under different testing scenarios with the number of triggered system calls are utilized in the model training process. A balanced recursive feature elimination with cross-validation approach is proposed to select and rank the importance of the different system calls. Seven machine learning models are trained over the selected features with cross-validation and hyper-parameter tuning technique, where linear regression with the Lasso regularization outperforms all the other models. Then, the model is evaluated on the data set that measures the energy consumption on different revision history of the selected apps. The results show that the optimized Lasso model could detect energy bugs in the revision history of various applications. Optimization strategies are provided based on the selected features.",2019,IEEE Access
The LASSO Method for Bilinear Time Series Models,"In this article we propose a method called GLLS for the fitting of bilinear time series models.

The Monte Carlo simulation studies and a real data example are reported to assess the performance of the proposed GLLS method.",2016,Communications in Statistics - Simulation and Computation
Graphical modeling of binary data using the LASSO: a simulation study,"BackgroundGraphical models were identified as a promising new approach to modeling high-dimensional clinical data. They provided a probabilistic tool to display, analyze and visualize the net-like dependence structures by drawing a graph describing the conditional dependencies between the variables. Until now, the main focus of research was on building Gaussian graphical models for continuous multivariate data following a multivariate normal distribution. Satisfactory solutions for binary data were missing. We adapted the method of Meinshausen and BÃ¼hlmann to binary data and used the LASSO for logistic regression. Objective of this paper was to examine the performance of the Bolasso to the development of graphical models for high dimensional binary data. We hypothesized that the performance of Bolasso is superior to competing LASSO methods to identify graphical models.MethodsWe analyzed the Bolasso to derive graphical models in comparison with other LASSO based method. Model performance was assessed in a simulation study with random data generated via symmetric local logistic regression models and Gibbs sampling. Main outcome variables were the Structural Hamming Distance and the Youden Index.We applied the results of the simulation study to a real-life data with functioning data of patients having head and neck cancer.ResultsBootstrap aggregating as incorporated in the Bolasso algorithm greatly improved the performance in higher sample sizes. The number of bootstraps did have minimal impact on performance. Bolasso performed reasonable well with a cutpoint of 0.90 and a small penalty term. Optimal prediction for Bolasso leads to very conservative models in comparison with AIC, BIC or cross-validated optimal penalty terms.ConclusionsBootstrap aggregating may improve variable selection if the underlying selection process is not too unstable due to small sample size and if one is mainly interested in reducing the false discovery rate. We propose using the Bolasso for graphical modeling in large sample sizes.",2012,BMC Medical Research Methodology

Their use of low-degree-of-freedom smoothing splines as a base learner provides an interesting approach to adaptive additive modeling. The notion of â€œTwin Boostingâ€ is interesting as well; besides the adaptive lasso, we have seen the idea applied more directly for the lasso and Dantzig selector (James, Radchenko & Lv 2007). In this discussion we elaborate on the connections between L2-boosting of a linear model and infinitesimal forward stagewise linear regression (Section 5.2.1 in BH). We then take the authors to task on their definition of degrees of freedom (Section 5.3 of BH).",2007,
"Selection: 524,288 ways to say ""this is interesting""","Visualization is a critical technology for understanding complex, data-rich systems. Effective visualizations make important features of the data immediately recognizable and enable the user to discover interesting and useful results by highlighting patterns. A key element of such systems is the ability to interact with displays of data by selecting a subset for further investigation. This operation is needed for use in linked-views systems and in drill-down analysis. It is a common manipulation in many other systems. It is as ubiquitous as selecting icons in a desktop GUI. It is therefore surprising to note that little research has been done on how selection can be implemented. This paper addresses this omission, presenting a taxonomy for selection mechanisms and discussing the interactions between branches of the taxonomy. Our suggestion of 524,288 possible systems [2/sup 16/ operation systems/spl times/2 (memory/memoryless)/spl times/2 (data-dependent/independent)/spl times/2 (brush/lasso)] is more in fun than serious, as within the taxonomy there are many different choices that can be made.

Statistical methods for predicting genetic regulation,"Transcriptional regulation of gene expression is essential for cellular differentiation and function, and defects in the process are associated with cancer. Transcription is regulated by the cis-acting regulatory regions and trans-acting regulatory elements. Transcription factors bind on enhancers and repressors and form complexes by interacting with each other to control the expression of the genes. Understanding the regulation of genes would help us to understand the biological system and can be helpful in identifying therapeutic targets for diseases such as cancer. The ENCODE project has mapped binding sites of many TFs in some important cell types and this project also has mapped DNase I hypersensitivity sites across the cell types. 
Predicting transcription factors mutual interactions would help us in finding the potential transcription regulatory networks. Here, we have developed two methods for prediction of transcription factors mutual interactions from ENCODE ChIP-seq data, and both methods generated similar results which tell us about the accuracy of the methods. It is known that functional regions of genome are conserved and here we identified that shared/overlapping transcription factor binding sites in multiple cell types and in transcription factors pairs are more conserved than their respective non-shared/non-overlapping binding sites. It has been also studied that co-binding sites influence the expression level of genes. Most of the genes mapped to the transcription factor co-binding sites have significantly higher level of expression than those genes which were mapped to the single transcription factor bound sites. The ENCODE data suggests a very large number of potential regulatory sites across the complete genome in many cell types and methods are needed to identify those that are most relevant and to connect them to the genes that they control. A penalized regression method, LASSO was used to build correlative models, and choose two regulatory regions that are predictive of gene expression, and link them to their respective gene. 
Here, we show that our identified regulatory regions accumulate significant number of somatic mutations that occur in cancer cells, suggesting that their effects may drive cancer initiation and development. Harboring of somatic mutations in these identified regulatory regions is an indication of positive selection, which has been also observed in cancer related genes.",2016,

Integrating remotely sensed data into forest resource inventories,"The past two decades have demonstrated a great potential for airborne Light Detection 
and Ranging (LiDAR) data to improve the efficiency of forest resource inventories (FRIs). 
In order to make efficient use of LiDAR data in FRIs, the data need to be related to 
observations taken in the field. Various modeling techniques are available that enable 
a data analyst to establish a link between the two data sources. While the choice for 
a modeling technique may have negligible effects on point estimates, different model 
techniques may deliver different estimates of precision. 
This study investigated the impact of various model and variable selection procedures 
on estimates of precision. The focus was on LiDAR applications in FRIs. The procedures considered included stepwise variable selection procedures such as the Akaike 
Information Criterion (AIC), the corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc), and 
the Bayesian (or Schwarz) Information Criterion. Variables have also been selected 
based on the condition number of the matrix of covariates (i.e., LiDAR metrics) and 
the variance inflation factor. Other modeling techniques considered in this study were 
ridge regression, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso), partial least 
squares regression, and the random forest algorithm. Stepwise variable selection procedures have been considered in both, the (design-based) model-assisted, as well as in 
the model-based (or model-dependent) inference framework. All other techniques were 
investigated only for the model-assisted approach. 
In a comprehensive simulation study, the effects of the different modeling techniques 
on the precision of population parameter estimates (mean aboveground biomass per 
hectare) were investigated. Five different datasets were used. Three artificial datasets 
were simulated; two further datasets were based on FRI data from Canada and Norway. 
Canonical vine copulas were employed to create synthetic populations from the FRI 
data. From all populations simple random samples of different size were repeatedly 
drawn and the mean and variance of the mean were estimated for each sample. While 
for the model-based approach only a single variance estimator was investigated, for the 
model-assisted approach three alternative estimators were examined. 
The results of the simulation studies suggest that blind application of stepwise variable 
selection procedures lead to overly optimistic estimates of precision in LiDAR-assisted 
FRIs. The effects were severe for small sample sizes (n = 40 and n = 50). For large 
samples (n = 400) overestimation of precision was negligible. Good performance in 
terms of empirical standard errors and coverage rates were obtained for ridge regression, 
Lasso, and the random forest algorithm. This study concludes that the use of the latter 
three modeling techniques may prove useful in future LiDAR-assisted FRIs.",2015,
The Adaptive Lasso and Its Oracle Properties,"The lasso is a popular technique for simultaneous estimation and variable selection. Lasso variable selection has been shown to be consistent under certain conditions. In this work we derive a necessary condition for the lasso variable selection to be consistent. Consequently, there exist certain scenarios where the lasso is inconsistent for variable selection. We then propose a new version of the lasso, called the adaptive lasso, where adaptive weights are used for penalizing different coefficients in the l1 penalty. We show that the adaptive lasso enjoys the oracle properties; namely, it performs as well as if the true underlying model were given in advance. Similar to the lasso, the adaptive lasso is shown to be near-minimax optimal. Furthermore, the adaptive lasso can be solved by the same efficient algorithm for solving the lasso. We also discuss the extension of the adaptive lasso in generalized linear models and show that the oracle properties still hold under mild regularity conditions.

Ensembling Variable Selectors by Stability Selection for the Cox Model,"As an effective tool to build interpretive models, variable selection plays an increasingly important role in high-dimensional data analysis. It has been proven that ensemble learning can significantly improve selection accuracy, alleviate the instability of traditional selection methods, and reduce false discovery rate (FDR). Therefore, variable selection ensembles (VSEs) have gained much interest in recent years. Stability selection [1], a VSE technique based on subsampling in combination with a base algorithm like lasso, is an effective method to control FDR and to improve selection accuracy in linear regression models. In this paper, we apply it to handle variable selection problems in a Cox model. Some simulated data with various censoring rates are used to study the influence of one parameter Amin in stability selection to its performance. In the meantime, stability selection is compared with other variable selection approaches. The experimental results demonstrate its good performance.",2017,Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience

The Influence of celebrity endorsement towards purchase intention (a case study of Ari Lasso and Daihatsu Luxio in Jakarta),"The research in this thesis examines the influence of celebrity endorsement towards purchase intention in the context of Ari Lasso and Daihatsu Luxio. Celebrity endorsement is represented the characteristics of the celebrity which are conceptualized by constructs of trustworthiness, expertise, familiarity, likability, similarity, product-fit. The data gathering was carried out using questionnaire where the sampling method was purposive judgment. The number of research respondents is 160 in which the writer managed to get 157 valid questionnaires. The analyses pointed out that celebrity characteristics, as a unity, do affect purchase intention. However, the model can only explain 38.4% of the variabiity in purchase intention. Further information is acquired as intervening variables are employed In the case where affective and cognitive attitudes toward the advertisement are employed, celebrity characteristics managed to explain 53.1% variability in the affective side and 49.4% in the cognitive side. Moreover, those attitudes toward advertisement managed to explain 47.9% variability in attitude towards the brand. Eventually, Attitude towards the brand managed to explain 65.9% variability in purchase intention.",2009,
Integrating prior biological knowledge and graphical LASSO for network inference,"Systems biology aims at unravelling the mechanisms of complex diseases by investigating how individual elements of the cell (e.g., genes, proteins, metabolites, etc.) interact with each other. Network-based methods provide an intuitive framework to model, characterize, and understand these interactions. To reconstruct a biological network, one can either query public databases for known interactions (knowledge-driven approach) or build a mathematical model to measure the associations from data (data-driven approach). In this paper, we propose a new network inference method, integrating knowledge and data-driven approaches. The method integrates prior biological knowledge (i.e., protein-protein interactions from BioGRID database) and a Gaussian graphical model (i.e., graphical LASSO algorithm) to construct robust and biologically relevant network. The network is then utilized to extract differential sub-networks between case and control groups using the result from a statistical analysis (e.g., logistic regression). We applied the proposed method on a proteomic dataset acquired by analysis of sera from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cases and patients with liver cirrhosis. The differential sub-networks led to the identification of hub proteins and key pathways, whose relevance to HCC study has been confirmed by literature survey.",2015,2015 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)
Convergence of LCA Flows to (C)LASSO Solutions,"This paper establishes several convergence results about flows of the dynamical system LCA (Locally Competitive Algorithm) to the mixed $\ell_2$-$\ell_1$ minimization problem LASSO and the constrained version, called CLASSO here, where the parameters are required to be non-negative. (C)LASSO problems are closely related to various important applications including efficient coding, image recognition and image reconstruction. That the solution of (C)LASSO can be determined by LCA allows the former to be solved in novel ways such as through a physical realization of analog circuits or on non-von Neumann computers. As discussed in the paper, previous works that show convergence of LCA to LASSO are incomplete, and do not consider CLASSO. The main contributions of this paper are a particular generalization of LaSalle's invariance principle and its application to rigorously establish LCA's convergence to (C)LASSO.",2016,arXiv: Numerical Analysis

Anatomical and ultrastructural studies of chemical defence in the sponge Dysidea fragilis,"Abstract The marine sponge Dysidea fragilis from El Mar Menor, a hypersaline coastal lagoon (Murcia, Spain), contains the furanosesquiterpenoid ent-furodysinin as the major secondary metabolite. D. fragilis emits a defensive white fluid when it is disturbed. Electron micrographs of this fluid revealed intact vesiculated cells together with other amorphous material. Dissociated cells are more rounded in shape but maintain the same ultrastructural features as cells observed in ultra-thin sections of the whole sponge. The defensive secretion is composed mainly of sponge cells with abundant light vesicles. Sometimes these light vesicles appear to open into the intercellular space; this correlates with surface blebs on these cells observed under scanning electron microscopy. The intracellular location of ent-furodysinin was confirmed by Erlich staining. In laboratory assays, we examined the role of ent-furodysinin as a feeding deterrent to generalist fish predators. It was isolated from D. fragilis and incorporated into a carrageenan-based artificial diet. The addition of ent-furodysinin to the artificial diet reduced feeding by the fish Thalassoma pavo. Similarly, fish did not feed on artificial diet above which defensive secretion of D. fragilis had been ejected with a small syringe.",1998,Marine Biology
"Food additives: distribution and co-occurrence in 126,000 food products of the French market","Background. More than 330 food additives (e.g. artificial sweeteners, emulsifiers, dyes) are authorized in Europe, with a great variability of use across food products. Objective. The objective of this study was to investigate the distribution and co-occurrence of food additives in a large-scale database of foods and beverages available on the French market. Design. The open access crowdsourced Open Food Facts database (https://world.openfoodfacts.org/) was used to retrieve the composition of food and beverage products commonly marketed on the French market (nâ€‰=â€‰126,556), based on the ingredients list. Clustering of food additive variables was used in order to determine groups of additives frequently co-occurring in food products. The clusters were confirmed by network analysis, using the eLasso method. Results. Fifty-three-point eight percent of food products contained at least 1 food additive and 11.3% at least 5. Food categories most likely to contain food additives (in more than 85% of food items) were artificially sweetened beverages, ice creams, industrial sandwiches, biscuits and cakes. The most frequently used food additives were citric acid, lecithins and modified starches (>10,000 products each). Some food additives with suspected health effects also pertained to the top 50: sodium nitrite, potassium nitrate, carrageenan, monosodium glutamate, sulfite ammonia caramel, acesulfame K, sucralose, (di/tri/poly) phosphates, mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids, potassium sorbate, cochineal, potassium metabisulphite, sodium alginate, and bixin (>800 food products each). We identified 6 clusters of food additives frequently co-occurring in food products. Conclusions. Food additives are widespread in industrial French products and some clusters of additives frequently co-occurring in food products were identified. These results pave the way to future etiological studies merging composition data to food consumption data to investigate their association with chronic disease risk, in particular potential â€˜cocktail effectsâ€™.",2020,Scientific Reports
Analyzing Risks Related to the Use of Pesticides in Vegetable Gardens in Burkina Faso,"In West Africa, the uncontrolled use of pesticides by vegetable farmers leads to contamination of soils as well as surface and ground water. Farmers also use various sources of organic amendments which could impact the fate of the pesticides in soils. This study was conducted to identify the type of pesticides and organic amendments used in the main vegetable gardens in Ouagadougou, Ouahigouya and Bobo-Dioulasso three cities of Burkina Faso. Farmers were interviewed individually on their practices regarding organic amendments and pesticides. Sixty one percent (61%) of farmers do not know the instruction regarding the application of pesticides. Fifty three percent (53%) of farmers did never receive training on pesticide application. We found that pyrethroid-based insecticides like lambda-cyhalothrin and delthametrin were the most used by farmers. About 69%, 59% and 100% of the farmers apply the pesticides periodically in their fields respectively in Ouagadougou, Ouahigouya and Bobo-Dioulasso. All the farmers interviewed attested that they do not respect the recommended doses of pesticides. Manure was the organic amendment mostly used in the three cities (41-75%), followed by household garbage (15-41%). In Ouagadougou most of farmers (69%) apply organic amendment at the recommended rate or more while in Bobo-Dioulasso (69%) and in Ouahigouya (57%), the majority apply low rates. There is a correlation between the social status (sex and the education level) and the pesticide and organic amendment management.",2015,"Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries"
Dynamic prediction of cancer-specific survival for primary hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma,"This study investigated a large cohort of patients to construct a predictive nomogram and a web-based survival rate calculator for dynamically predicting the cancer-specific survival of patients with primary hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (HSCC). Patients (nâ€‰=â€‰2007) initially diagnosed with primary HSCC from 2004 to 2015 were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. All patients were randomly divided into the training and validation cohorts (1:1). The Lasso Cox regression model was applied to identify independent risk factors of cancer-specific survival for a predictive nomogram and a web-based calculator. The model was evaluated by concordance index, calibration, and decision curve analysis. Cancer-specific survival rates decreased with time, while 3-year conditional survival increased. Cancer-specific deaths evolved from relatively high within the first 3 years to low thereafter. Age, race, T stage, N stage, M stage, surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and marital status were identified as independent risk factors. We constructed a predictive nomogram for survival and a web-based calculator (https://linzhongyang.shinyapps.io/Hypopharyngeal/). Additionally, a prognostic risk stratification was developed according to nomogram total points. Patients with primary HSCC were found at a high risk of cancer-specific death during the first 3 years, indicating that additional effective follow-up strategies should be implemented over the period. This is the first study to construct a predictive nomogram and a web-based calculator for all patients with HSCC.",2020,International Journal of Clinical Oncology

Cluster-like headache attacks triggered by nitrofurantoin intake,"Sir,A wide spectrum of drugs can induce headache, which is infact one of the most common adverse drug events [1, 2].Although headache is usually a nonserious, unwanted effect,itcould bedifficult toquickly and correctly diagnose, leadingto repeated medical consultations, prescription of laboratoryor instrumental examinations, and even hospitalization [1].The International Headache Classification (IHC), inChapter 8, includes these secondary headaches as adversereactions to drugs [3]. Whereas some drug-related headachesare well characterized, others lack specific and accuratedefinition [1]. We present a patient experiencing cluster-likeattacks after nitrofurantoin consumption.A previously healthy 42-year-old man with no personal orfamily history of migraine, tension, or cluster headachepresented to the emergency room (ER) complaining of asevere unilateral left-sided headache. The pain was describedas lancinating, centered on the left eye and extending toperiorbital, supraorbital, and temporal regions. It wasaccompanied by conjunctival injection, lacrimation, eyelidedema, facial swelling, nasal congestion, and rhinorrhea ontheaffectedside.Theattackquicklyworsened,peakingwithin5â€“10 min, with a duration of about 60 min; both pain and theaccompanying autonomic signs spontaneously resolved. Theheadache began about 1 h after he took a tablet ofnitrofurantoin (50 mg) for a urinary tract infection. The daybefore, just after the first-ever consumption of nitrofurantoin,he had a headache attack with the same clinical presentation,the same latency between drug consumption and pain onset,and the same duration. Physical and neurologicalexaminations were normal, as were routine hematologicaltests and brain magnetic resonance imaging. As both attacksfollowed the intake of nitrofurantoin, the patient was advisedto stop taking the drug, which was replaced with a differentantibiotic agent (ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily).Thereafter, he experienced no further headache attacks.During a 2-year follow-up, he remained headache free.Theclosetemporalassociationbetweenthedrugintakeandthe appearance of headache on two occasions suggests acausal relationship. Nitrofurantoin is a widely used drug fortreating and preventing urinary tract infections. Headache is awell-known and one of the most common adverse effects,occurring in about 4â€“6 % of users [4, 5]; others side effectsinclude immune-mediated liver and lung reactions andpulmonary fibrosis. Nitrofurantoin-induced headache isusually described as severe to moderate; no specific featureshave been reported, and the pathogenetic mechanisms are notfully elucidated. Some authors [1] have categorized thisheadache as type C reactions arising from chronic use [6].Nitrofurantoin is usually included in the list of drugs that caninducebenignintracranialhypertension[7]andthenheadacherelated to raised intracranial pressure [2]. Our patient,however, had cluster-like attacks in close association withdrug intake. Several studies have demonstrated thatnitrofurans can release nitric oxide (NO) [8, 9], which is animportant neurotransmitter and regulates the vascular tone,acting as a potent vasodilator by diffusing into vascularsmooth-muscle cells. Moreover, NO is thought to play a rolein processing sensory information and pain sensitization [10].NO donors induce an immediate headache in healthyindividuals and in headache sufferers, with a delayedheadache with the characteristics of migraine, tension-type,orclusterheadacheinpatientssufferingfromtheseheadaches[10, 11].

Model-Assisted Survey Regression Estimation With The Lasso,"In the U.S. Forest Serviceâ€™s Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program, as in other natural resource surveys, many auxiliary variables are available for use in model-assisted inference about finite population parameters. Some of this auxiliary information may be extraneous, and therefore model selection is appropriate to improve the efficiency of the survey regression estimators of finite population totals. A model-assisted survey regression estimator using the lasso is presented and extended to the adaptive lasso. For a sequence of finite populations and probability sampling designs, asymptotic properties of the lasso survey regression estimator are derived, including design consistency and central limit theory for the estimator and design consistency of a variance estimator. To estimate multiple finite population quantities with the method, lasso survey regression weights are developed, using both a model calibration approach and a ridge regression approximation. The gains in efficiency of the lasso estimator over the full regression estimator are demonstrated through a simulation study estimating tree canopy cover for a region in Utah.",2017,Journal of Survey Statistics and Methodology
"Investigation of Genetic Variants, Birthweight and Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis Function Suggests a Genetic Variant in the SERPINA6 Gene Is Associated with Corticosteroid Binding Globulin in the Western Australia Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study","BACKGROUND
The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis regulates stress responses and HPA dysfunction has been associated with several chronic diseases. Low birthweight may be associated with HPA dysfunction in later life, yet human studies are inconclusive. The primary study aim was to identify genetic variants associated with HPA axis function. A secondary aim was to evaluate if these variants modify the association between birthweight and HPA axis function in adolescents.


METHODS
Morning fasted blood samples were collected from children of the Western Australia Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) at age 17 (n = 1077). Basal HPA axis function was assessed by total cortisol, corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG), and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). The associations between 124 tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within 16 HPA pathway candidate genes and each hormone were evaluated using multivariate linear regression and penalized linear regression analysis using the HyperLasso method.


RESULTS
The penalized regression analysis revealed one candidate gene SNP, rs11621961 in the CBG encoding gene (SERPINA6), significantly associated with total cortisol and CBG. No other candidate gene SNPs were significant after applying the penalty or adjusting for multiple comparisons; however, several SNPs approached significance. For example, rs907621 (p = 0.002) and rs3846326 (p = 0.003) in the mineralocorticoid receptor gene (NR3C2) were associated with ACTH and SERPINA6 SNPs rs941601 (p = 0.004) and rs11622665 (p = 0.008), were associated with CBG. To further investigate our findings for SERPINA6, rare and common SNPs in the gene were imputed from the 1,000 genomes data and 8 SNPs across the gene were significantly associated with CBG levels after adjustment for multiple comparisons. Birthweight was not associated with any HPA outcome, and none of the gene-birthweight interactions were significant after adjustment for multiple comparisons.


CONCLUSIONS
Our study suggests that genetic variation in the SERPINA6 gene may be associated with altered CBG levels during adolescence. Replication of these findings is required.",2014,PLoS ONE

Assessment of multiphasic contrast-enhanced MR textures in differentiating small renal mass subtypes,"AbstractPurposeThis study seeks to evaluate the use of quantitative texture parameters extracted from multiphasic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in differentiating between benign and malignant masses (oncocytoma vs. clear cell and papillary RCC) and between common subtypes of renal cell carcinoma (clear cell vs. papillary RCC) in small renal masses (<â€‰4Â cm).MethodOne-hundred and forty-two renal lesions (90 clear cell and 22 papillary RCCs; 30 oncocytomas) were identified in a cohort of 41 patients (18 men, 23 women: mean age, 52.8â€‰Â±â€‰14.4Â years) who underwent preoperative multiphasic contrast-enhanced MR with four phases (unenhanced, arterial, venous, and delayed) between 2015 and 2016. In this study, texture features were extracted from entire cross-sectional tumoral region in three consecutive slices containing the largest cross-sectional area from each of the four phases. The change in imaging feature between precontrast imaging and each postcontrast phase was calculated. Data dimension reduction and feature selection were performed by conducting (1) pairwise Wilcoxon rank test followed by modified false discovery rate adjustment, and (2) Lasso regression. Multivariate modeling incorporating the selected features was performed using random forest classification method.ResultsHistogram imaging features were informative variables in differentiating between benign and malignant masses, while textures imaging features were of added value in differentiating between subtypes of RCCs. Papillary RCCs were distinguished from clear cell RCCs (sensitivity 65.5%, specificity 88%, and accuracy 77.9%), oncocytomas from clear cell RCCs (sensitivity 67.3%, specificity 88.9%, and accuracy 79.3%), and oncocytomas from papillary and clear cell RCCs (sensitivity 64.7%, specificity 85.9%, and accuracy 77.9%).ConclusionsA combination of histogram and texture imaging features on multiphasic MR can help differentiate histologic cell types in common small renal masses (<â€‰4Â cm).

"Lithostratigraphy, Palynostratigraphy and Palynofacies Indications of the Depositional Environments of Upper Cretaceous to Paleogene Sediments, Offshore Eastern Dahomey Basin, SW Nigeria","The ditch cuttings from an offshore well, 'JX' were studied for their sedimentology, palynostratigraphy, palynofacies and depositional environment history. Lithologically, poorly sorted sandstones with variable interbeds of shales and siltstones overlain by dark grey shales and interbedded limestones with occasional pyrite occurrence (Abeokuta-Afowo Formations) constituted the basal sections. Overlying is a glauconitic sequence consisting of shale with little clay and lenses of limestones (Araromi Formation). The uppermost section consists of predominantly of shales with some glauconitic materials (Oshosun Formation). Occurrences of Canningia cf. senonica, Nelsoniella; Microdinium ornatum (dinoflagellates), Crybelosporites pannuceus, Cicatricosisporites spp. (spores), and Classopollis spp., Ephedripites (pollen) assemblage suggests a late Cenomanian age for the lowermost section while the occurrences of Lejeunecysta hyaline, Selenopemphix selenoides and Hystrichokolpoma rigudae (dinoflagellates) and Peregrinipollis nigericus, Retitricolporites irregularis and Ctenolophonidites costatus (pollen) and Foveotriletes margaritae (spore) at the uppermost section indicate an Eocene age. Palynological marine index (PMI) curve and the Peridinioid to Gonyaulacoid ratio (P/G ratio) between the different palynological assemblages showed very strong fluctuations. Six broad lithofacies units with characteristic palynofacies assemblages reflecting different paleoenvironment were distinguished, which varied from estuarine through shallow inner neritic (shelf) to middle neritic shelf settings.",2014,Earth Science Research
Estimation for misclassified data with ultra-high levels,"Outcome misclassification is widespread in classification problems, but methods to account for it are rarely used. In this paper, the problem of inference with misclassified multinomial logit data with a large number of multinomial parameters is addressed. We have had a significant swell of interest in the development of novel methods to infer misclassified data. One simulation study is shown regarding how seriously misclassification issue occurs if the number of categories increase. Then, using the group lasso regression, we will show how the best model should be fitted for that kind of multinomial regression problems comprehensively.",2016,
[Bobo Dioulasso Teaching Hospital day-care hospital: a reference structure for the management of HIV infected patients in Burkina Faso].,"OBJECTIVE
The goal of the study was to assess the activity of a multidisciplinary structure for HIV infected patients, two years after the opening of the day hospital.


DESIGN
A retrospective observational study of the Bobo Dioulasso day-hospital was made using the ESOPE (Epiconcept, France) software.


RESULTS
In 2002, 147 patients were followed in the Bobo Dioulasso university hospital, 27 (or 18.5 %) of whom were treated with antiretrovirals. Between 2005, opening of the day-hospital, and 2007, the total number of patients increased by 20 %. The number of patients on antiretrovirals rose from 47 to 70 % in the same time. The rate of patients with waved antiretroviral costs rose from 6 to 53 %. Three hundred and eighty-six patients died between 2002 and 2007. 1450 patients were lost to follow-up between 20002 and 2007.


CONCLUSIONS
Two years after its opening, the Bobo Dioulasso day-hospital manages one of the largest HIV cohort in sub-Saharan Africa and has become a reference structure in Burkina Faso. The analysis of this cohort was an opportunity to identify issues concerning HIV patient treatment in 2009.",2010,Medecine et maladies infectieuses
Data Assimilation in Large-scale Networks of Open Channels,"Author(s): Rafiee Jahromi, Mohammad | Advisor(s): Bayen, Alexandre M | Abstract: This dissertation is mainly focused on assimilation of data into hydrodynamic models of water flow in open channel networks which is motivated by the need for accurate flow models in various applications such as emergency response and flood monitoring systems, automated gate systems and hydrological studies. We investigate application of different data assimilation techniques in different scenarios to incorporate the available flow measurements obtained from sensors into flow models to improve their accuracy.Water flow in open channels is an instance of the so-called distributed parameters systems in which the dynamics of the system is described by a set of partial differential equations. As the flow model, the Saint-Venant equations, also known as shallow water equations, which are a set of first-order hyperbolic nonlinear partial differential equations are used. Different practical scenarios are considered. In a case in which streaming measurements of the flow are available and real-time estimation of the flow state is desired, we present how standard state estimation techniques such the Kalman filter, the Extended Kalman filter and the Unscented Kalman filter can be applied to integrate the available measurements into the shallow water equations. It is also shown how these techniques can be adapted to a case in which some of the model parameters are unknown to estimate unkown parameters along with the state of the system.For data assimilation in large-scale networks which lead to high dimensional models, application of two sequential Monte Carlo methods, the optimal sampling importance resampling and the implicit particle filters, is considered. The computational cost of propagating each particle is higher in implicit particle filters, however, they provide more accurate results with smaller number of particles by choosing the particles in a way that they belong to the high probability regions of the posterior density function. We also propose a maximum-a-posteriori-based method to perform the state estimation which is shown to perform better in terms of both accuracy and computational cost for the application of interest. For flow estimation in tidally influenced channels, an efficient estimation method which takes advantage of spectral decomposition of the state is proposed. The estimation problem is formulated as a least squares regression with an $l_1$-norm regularization, known as the LASSO, and a homotopy-based algorithm is implemented to solve the resulting optimization problem recursively as new measurements become available. Finally, we consider the problem of optimal topology design in multi-agent systems for efficient average consensus. The network design problem is posed in two different ways. (1) Assuming that the maximum communication cost, i.e. the maximum number of communication links, is known, the goal is to find the network topology which results in the fastest convergence to the consensus (in presence of communication time delays on the links). (2) If a minimum performance of the protocol is required, the design problem is posed as finding the network with lowest possible communication cost which fulfills the required performance. The design problem is formulated as an optimization problem which is finally transformed to a mixed integer semidefinite program.",2012,
Laplacian Black Box Variational Inference,"Black box variational inference (BBVI) is a recently proposed estimation method for parameters of statistical models. BBVI is an order of magnitude faster than Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The computation of BBVI is similar to maximum a posteriori estimation, but in addition to the point estimation given by the latter, BBVI also estimate another important statistic, i.e. the range of the parameters. Assuming normal distribution for the parameters, BBVI minimizes the KL divergence between the normal distribution and the statistical models. However if the parameters are not normal distributed, the estimation might not be precise. Similarly, if outliers are allowed then fat tail distributions are more suitable to model parameters. This paper discusses the problems of Cauchy and Student's t-distribution as a variational distribution. Inspired by Lasso, this paper replaces normal with Laplace distribution to implement BBVI. Experiment on linear regression shows, under non-ideal condition (e.g. with outlier data), BBSI based on Laplace provides more stable and correct estimation.",2017,
Texture Models Based on Probabilistic Graphical Models,"Texture is one of the visual features playing an important role in image analysis.Many applications have been discovered using texture models.Probabilistic graphical models Science,are promising tools for constructing texture models.The problem of learning the structure of GGM for texture classification is addressed.GGM are characterized by a neighborhood,a set of parameters,and a noise sequence due to the connection between the local Markov property and conditional regression of a Gaussian random variable.By use of the methods of model selection to choose an appropriate neighborhood and estimate the unknown parameters for modeling GGM,neighborhood selection and parameter estimation are conducted simultaneously.And then new texture features based on GGM for texture synthesis and texture classification are extracted.Experimental results show that adaptive Lasso estimators are more effective.",2011,

Relativistic theory for picosecond time transfer in the vicinity of Earth,"Abstract : The problem of light propagation is treated in a geocentric reference system with the goat of ensuring picosecond accuracy for time transfer techniques using electromagnetic signals in the vicinity of the Earth. We give an explicit formula for a one way time transfer, to be applied when the spatial coordinates of the time transfer stations are known in a geocentric reference system rotating with the Earth. This expression is extended, at the same accuracy level of one picosecond, to the special cases of two way and LASSO time transfers via geostationary satellites.",1994,

Sick leave and return to work after surgery for type II SLAP lesions of the shoulder: a secondary analysis of a randomised sham-controlled study,"OBJECTIVES
To compare days on sick leave and assess predictors of return to work following shoulder surgery.


DESIGN
A secondary analysis of a randomised controlled trial.


SETTING
Orthopaedic department.


PARTICIPANTS
114 patients with type II superior labral tear from anterior to posterior of the shoulder.


INTERVENTIONS
Labral repair, biceps tenodesis or sham surgery.


OUTCOME MEASURES
Sick leave was obtained from national registers for the last year before and 2â€‰years following surgery. Total and shoulder related number of days on sick leave were obtained, using international diagnostic codes. We applied the difference-in-difference approach to compare the differences in the change in mean work days on sick leave between groups over time, backwards logistic regression and lasso regression to evaluate predictors.


RESULTS
Mean total number of work days on sick leave during the 2 years after surgery was 148 (range 0-460) days. More than 80% of the sick leave days were taken by 22% of the patients. Days on sick leave classified as shoulder-related constituted 80% of the total. In all three treatment groups, the mean total number of days on sick leave doubled the year after surgery. Sham surgery and labral repair had fewer postoperative sickness absence days compared with biceps tenodesis but differences were not significant when adjusted for days of sick leave the year before surgery. Predictors of return to work at 2 years analysed by logistic regression were no sick leave (OR 8.0, 95%â€‰CI 2.4 to 26.0) and moderate symptoms of anxiety or depression (OR 0.16, 95%â€‰CI 0.05 to 0.5) at inclusion. Similar results were obtained by lasso regression but manual work was an additional predictor.


CONCLUSIONS
Change in mean work days on sick leave comparing sham surgery, labral repair and biceps tenodesis, was not significantly different. Sick leave, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and manual work at inclusion predicted work status 2 years after surgery.

Algorithm for answer graph construction for keyword queries on RDF data,"RDF and RDFS have recently become very popular as frameworks for representing data and meta-data in form of a domain description, respectively. RDF data can also be thought of as graph data. In this paper, we focus on keywordbased querying of RDF data represented as a graph. Existing approaches for answering such keyword queries, identies connected trees with minimal cost in the labeled graph as answers. In this paper we present an elegant algorithm for keyword query processing on RDF data that not only identies trees but also more meaningful graph structures including cycles. The approach adopts a pruned exploration mechanism where closely related nodes are identied, sub-graphs are pruned and joined using suitable hook nodes. The system also exploits Type/SubClassOf relationship during the construction of the answer graph. The working of the algorithm is illustrated using a fragment of AIFB institute data represented as an RDF graph.",2011,
Discriminative Lasso,"Lasso-type variable selection has been demonstrated to be effective in handling high-dimensional data. From the biological perspective, traditional Lasso-type models are capable of learning which stimuli are valuable while ignoring the many that are not, and thus perform feature selection. Traditional Lasso has the tendency to over-emphasize sparsity and to overlook the correlations between features. These drawbacks have been demonstrated to be critical in limiting its performance on real-world feature selection problems. Although some work has considered the problem of correlation, the issue of discriminative ability resulting from sparsity has been overlooked. To overcome this shortcoming, we propose a discriminative Lasso (referred to as dLasso) in which sparsity and correlation are jointly considered. Specifically, the new method can select features (or stimuli) that are correlated more strongly with the response but are less correlated with each other. Moreover, an efficient alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is presented to solve the resulting sparse non-convex optimization problem. Extensive experiments on different datasets show that although our proposed model is not a convex problem, it outperforms both its approximately convex counterparts and a number of state-of-the-art feature selection methods.",2016,Cognitive Computation
Assessment on latitudinal tree species richness using environmental factors in the southeastern United States,"The southeastern region of the United States exhibits an unusual trend of decreasing tree species richness (TSR) from higher to lower latitudes over the Florida peninsula. This trend contradicts the widely marked latitudinal diversity gradient where species richness is highest in tropical zones and decreases towards extratropical regions. This study aims to assess the environmental factors that prompt this atypical inverse latitudinal gradient seen in TSR using the USDA Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) database. Fifteen variables under four categories of forested area, groundwater, soil properties, and climate groups were examined to model TSR in the region. Generalized linear models (GLMs) with Poisson distributions first assessed individual variables to test explanatory power then the LASSO regularization method was utilized to extract two subsets of the most influential variables to predict TSR. Forest area and four climate variables (mean annual temperature, precipitation seasonality, mean temperature of coldest quarter, and mean precipitation of driest quarter) were the top five variables during the initial GLM assessment implying their potential individual influence in regulating TSR. Two subsets of LASSO models contained seven and three predictor variables, respectively. Frist subset includes seven predictors, presented in highest to low standardized coefficient, mean temperature of coldest quarter, forested area, precipitation seasonality, mean precipitation of driest quarter, water table depth, spodosol, and available water storage. The other subset further excluded four lowest influential variables from the first set, leaving the top three variables from the first subset. The first subset of the LASSO model predicted TSR with 63.4% explained deviance while the second subset reproduced 60.2% of deviance explained. With only three variables used, the second model outperformed the first model evaluated by the AIC value. We conclude that forest patch area, mean temperature of coldest quarter, and precipitation seasonality are the highly influential variables of TSR among environmental factors in the southeastern region of U.S., but evolutionary or historic cause should be further incorporated to fully understand tree species diversity pattern in this region.",2019,PeerJ
Comment on â€˜Seagrass Viviparous Propagules as a Potential Long-Distance Dispersal Mechanismâ€™ by A. C. G. Thomson et al.,"In a recent paper by Thomson et al. (2014), vivipary is implied for the eastern Australian Zostera, Zostera nigricaulis (revised from Zostera tasmanica; Kuo 2005). However, the definition of vivipary (production of genetically distinct offspring resulting from sexual reproduction) needs to be fully explored in terms of the experimental claims by the authors. Thomson et al. (2014) appear to confuse vivipary with vegetative (clonal) growth, where the clonal units have potentially dispersive capabilities. Importantly, the authors claim that â€˜viviparous propagules may disperse over large distances and successfully recruit or contribute to population connectivityâ€™ is not supported by appropriate data demonstrating dispersal and long-term survival. A key issue we found was the need for an understanding of the accepted definition of what comprises vivipary, pseudovivipary and vegetative reproduction and the attendant genetic consequences. We reinterpret the results of Thomson et al. (2014) based on the likelihood that the propagules they used for in situ and ex situ trials are simply vegetative growth forms, potentially produced under conditions of stress and/or failure to reproduce sexually. We also point out misinterpretations and conclude with a warning and recommendation. Vivipary in flowering plants is the precocious and continuous growth of sexual offspring while still attached to the maternal parent (Goebel 1905; Arber 1965; Elmquist and Cox 1996). There are two main types of vivipary: true vivipary and pseudovivipary. True vivipary involves the germination of sexually produced offspring while still attached to the parent plant. Offspring are genetically distinct from parent plants, as true vivipary results from sexual reproduction. True vivipary has been demonstrated in Cactaceae (Cota-SÃ¡nchez 2004) and mangroves (which Thomson et al. 2014 refer to correctly). A molecular phylogenetic analysis of mangroves inferred that vivipary originated in multiple independent times within the group (Shi et al. 2005). Currently, vivipary is reported and demonstrated based on anatomical characters in only two seagrass genera: Amphibolis and Thalassodendron (Cymodoceaceae; Kuo and Kirkman 1990). The position of these taxa in a phylogeny of marine flowering plants (Les et al. 1997) suggests that this trait has evolved only once in seagrasses. In pseudovivipary, the floral organs are replaced by plantlets, providing an asexual means for many terrestrial monocots (ancestors of marine seagrasses) to reproduce in extreme environments, such as alpine or arid ecosystems (Elmquist and Cox 1996). The upper portion of these plantlets has reverted from sexual to vegetative development. The important difference between pseudoviviparous plantlets and typical vegetative growth is that the plantlets retain the dehiscence Communicated by John C. Callaway",2015,Estuaries and Coasts
Rapid Detection of Hot-spot by Tensor Decomposition with Application to Weekly Gonorrhea Data,"In many bio-surveillance and healthcare applications, data sources are measured from many spatial locations repeatedly over time, say, daily/weekly/monthly. In these applications, we are typically interested in detecting hot-spots, which are defined as some structured outliers that are sparse over the spatial domain but persistent over time. In this paper, we propose a tensor decomposition method to detect when and where the hot-spots occur. Our proposed methods represent the observed raw data as a three-dimensional tensor including a circular time dimension for daily/weekly/monthly patterns, and then decompose the tensor into three components: smooth global trend, local hot-spots, and residuals. A combination of LASSO and fused LASSO is used to estimate the model parameters, and a CUSUM procedure is applied to detect when and where the hot-spots might occur. The usefulness of our proposed methodology is validated through numerical simulation and a real-world dataset in the weekly number of gonorrhea cases from $2006$ to $2018$ for $50$ states in the United States.",2020,arXiv: Applications

Anhydrobiosis in Embryos of the Brine Shrimp Artemia: Characterization of Metabolic Arrest during Reductions in Cell-associated Water,"Upon entry into the state of anhydrobiosis, trehalose-based energy metabolism is arrested in Artemia embryos (cysts). We have compared changes in the levels of trehalose, glycogen, some glycolytic intermediates and adenylate nucleotides in hydrated embryos observed under conditions of aerobic development with those occurring after transfer to 50moll âˆ’1 NaCl. This treatment is known to reduce cellassociated water into a range previously referred to as the ametabolic domain. The trehalose utilization and glycogen synthesis that occur during development of fully hydrated cysts are both blocked during desiccation. Upon return to 0.25 moll âˆ’1 NaCl both processes are resumed. Analysis of glycolytic intermediates suggests that the inhibition is localized at the trehalase, hexokinase and phosphofructokinase reactions. ATP level remains constant during the 6-h period of dehydration, as does the adenylate energy charge. An additional dehydration experiment was performed in 5.0moll âˆ’1 NaCl containing 50mmoll âˆ’1 ammonium chloride (pH9-0). The resulting level of gaseous ammonia in the medium has been shown to maintain an alkaline intracellular pH (pHi) in the embryos. The metabolic response to dehydration under these conditions was very similar to the previous dehydration series. Thus, these results are taken as strong evidence that the metabolic suppression observed during dehydration does not require cellular acidification, in contrast to the pronounced inhibitory role of low pHi during entry of hydrated embryos into the quiescent state of anaerobic dormancy. The arrest of carbohydrate metabolism seen during anhydrobiosis indeed appears to be a strict function of embryo water content.",1988,The Journal of Experimental Biology

Language recognition via sparse coding over learned dictionary,"In this work, we explore the use of sparse features derived using a learned dictionary for language recognition (LR). These sparse features are referred to as s-vector and are derived by sparse coding of the commonly used low-dimensional i-vector based representation of speech utterances over the learned dictionary. The orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and elastic net (ENet) based sparse coding algorithms have been investigated for deriving the s-vectors. Two classifiers namely cosine distance scoring (CDS) and support vector machine (SVM) have been applied on the s-vectors. Scores are calibrated using regularized multi-class logistic regression. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is empirically validated on NIST 2007 LRE data set in closed set condition on 30 seconds duration segments.",2017,2017 4th International Conference on Signal Processing and Integrated Networks (SPIN)
Hyperspectral unmixingwith sparse group lasso,"Sparse unmixing has been recently introduced as a mechanism to characterize mixed pixels in remotely sensed hyperspectral images. It assumes that the observed image signatures can be expressed in the form of linear combinations of a number of pure spectral signatures known in advance (e.g., spectra collected on the ground by a field spectroradiometer). Unmixing then amounts to finding the optimal subset of signatures in a (potentially very large) spectral library that can best model each mixed pixel in the scene. In available spectral libraries, it is observed that the spectral signatures appear organized in groups (e.g. different alterations of a single mineral in the U.S. Geological Survey spectral library). In this paper, we explore the potential of the sparse group lasso technique in solving hyperspectral unmixing problems. Our introspection in this work is that, when the spectral signatures appear in groups, this technique has the potential to yield better results than the standard sparse regression approach. Experimental results with both synthetic and real hyperspectral data are given to investigate this issue.",2011,2011 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium
Correlation between impulse oscillometry parameters and asthma control in an adult population,"Purpose: Impulse oscillometry (IOS) has been proposed as an alternative test to evaluate the obstruction of small airways and to detect changes in airways earlier than spirometry. In this study, we sought to determine the utility and association of IOS parameters with spirometry and asthma control in an adult population. Patients and methods: Adults 14-82 years of age with asthma were classified into uncontrolled asthma (n=48), partially controlled asthma (n=45), and controlled asthma (n=49) groups,Â and characterized with fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO), IOS, and spirometry in a transversal analysis planned as a one-visit study. The basic parameters evaluated in IOS are resistance at 5 Hz (R5), an index affected by the large and small airway; resistance at 20 Hz (R20), an index of the resistance of large airways; difference between R5 and R20 (R5-R20), indicative of the function of the small peripheral airways; reactance at 5 Hz (X5), indicative of the capacitive reactance in the small peripheral airways; resonance frequency (Fres), the intermediate frequency at which the reactance is null, and reactance area (XA), which represents the total reactance (area under the curve) at all frequencies between 5 Hz to Fres. Results: There were statistical differences between groups in standard spirometry and IOS parameters reflecting small peripheral airways (R5, R10, R5-R20, Fres, XA and X5) (P<0.001). Accuracy of IOS and/or spirometry to discriminate between controlled asthma vs partially controlled asthma and uncontrolled asthma was low (AUC=0.61). Using linear regression models, we found a good association between spirometry and IOS. In order to evaluate IOS as an alternative or supplementary method for spirometry, we designed a predictive model for spirometry from IOS applying a penalized regression model (Lasso). Then, we compared the original spirometry values with the values obtained from the predictive model using Bland-Altman plots, and the models showed an acceptable bias in the case of FEV1/FVC, FEV1%, and FVC%. Conclusion: IOS did not show a discriminative capacity to correctly classify patients according to the degree of asthma control. However, values of IOS showed good association with values of spirometry. IOS could be considered as an alternative and accurate complement to spirometry in adults. In a predictive model, spirometry values estimated from IOS tended to overestimate in low values of ""real"" spirometry and underestimate in high values.",2019,Journal of Asthma and Allergy
Bayesian Group Lasso for Nonparametric Varying-coefficient Models with Application to Functional Genome-wide Association Studies.,"Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have proven powerful for comprehending the genetic architecture of complex traits, they are challenged by a high dimension of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as predictors, the presence of complex environmental factors, and longitudinal or functional natures of many complex traits or diseases. To address these challenges, we propose a high-dimensional varying-coefficient model for incorporating functional aspects of phenotypic traits into GWAS to formulate a so-called functional GWAS or fGWAS. Bayesian group lasso and the associated MCMC algorithms are developed to identify significant SNPs and estimate how they affect longitudinal traits through time-varying genetic actions. The model is generalized to analyze the genetic control of complex traits using subject-specific sparse longitudinal data. The statistical properties of the new model are investigated through simulation studies. We use the new model to analyze a real GWAS data set from the Framingham Heart Study, leading to the identification of several significant SNPs associated with age-specific changes of body mass index. The fGWAS model, equipped with Bayesian group lassso, will provide a useful tool for genetic and developmental analysis of complex traits or diseases.",2015,The annals of applied statistics
A nomogram for individual prediction of vascular invasion in primary breast cancer.,"OBJECTIVES
To explore the feasibility of preoperative prediction of vascular invasion (VI) in breast cancer patients using nomogram based on multiparametric MRI and pathological reports.


METHODS
We retrospectively collected 200 patients with confirmed breast cancer between January 2016 and January 2018. All patients underwent MRI examinations before the surgery. VI was identified by postoperative pathology. The 200 patients were randomly divided into training (nâ€‰=â€‰100) and validation datasets (nâ€‰=â€‰100) at a ratio of 1:1. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was used to select predictors most associated with VI of breast cancer. A nomogram was constructed to calculate the area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristics, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive prediction value (PPV) and negative prediction value (NPV). We bootstrapped the data for 2000 times without setting the random seed to obtain corrected results.


RESULTS
VI was observed in 79 patients (39.5%). LASSO selected 10 predictors associated with VI. In the training dataset, the AUC for nomogram was 0.94 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.89-0.99, the sensitivity was 78.9% (95%CI: 72.4%-89.1%), the specificity was 95.3% (95%CI: 89.1%-100.0%), the accuracy was 86.0% (95%CI: 82.0%-92.0%), the PPV was 95.7% (95%CI: 90.0%-100.0%), and the NPV was 77.4% (95%CI: 67.8%-87.0%). In the validation dataset, the AUC for nomogram was 0.89 (95%CI: 0.83-0.95), the sensitivity was 70.3% (95%CI: 60.7%-79.2%), the specificity was 88.9% (95%CI: 80.0%-97.1%), the accuracy was 77.0% (95%CI: 70.0%-83.0%), the PPV was 91.8% (95%CI: 85.3%-98.0%), and the NPV was 62.7% (95%CI: 51.7%-74.0%). The nomogram calibration curve shows good agreement between the predicted probability and the actual probability.


CONCLUSION
The proposed nomogram could be used to predict VI in breast cancer patients, which was helpful for clinical decision-making.",2019,European journal of radiology
Herbicide Experiment in Lentil Plot,"In the experiment plot,there are 17 and 48 kinds of weeds.The number of Gra mineous weed is more than the number of latifoliate weeds and accounts for 60% of the weeds,but the kinds is adverse.In this experiment,We used different kinds of herbicides and spraying methods.The result shows that the soil processing effect of 48% trifluralin cream is better than other herbicides applied before sowing(95.3% weeds can be killed),and 48% LASSO cream shows better effect to grassy weeds(88.7% weeds can be killed).The killing effect of 45% fomesafen cream is better than the others for latifoliate weeds before applied seedling(86.9% weeds can be killed),and application after seedling 10%flumiclorac-pentyl cream is better(79.6% weeds can be killed).All the herbicides are secure for lentil.According to the result,herbicides should be sprayed before seedling primarily,and after seedling as auxiliary.",2007,
Low-rank optimization in system identification,"In this thesis, the use of low-rank approximations in connection with problems in system identification is explored. Firstly, the motivation of using low-rank approximations in system identification is presented and the framework for lowrank optimization is derived. Secondly, three papers are presented where different problems in system identification are considered within the described lowrank framework. In paper A, a novel method involving the nuclear norm for estimating a Wiener model is introduced. As shown in the paper, this method performs better than existing methods in terms of finding an accurate model. In paper B and C, a group lasso framework is used to perform input selection in the model estimation which also is connected to the low rank framework. The model structures where these novel methods of input selection is used on are ARX models and state space models, respectively. As shown in the respective papers, these strategies of performing input selection perform better than existing methods in both terms of estimation and input selection.",2019,
Review of Regression Analysis Models,"In statistics and data analysis, we often need to establish a relationship between the various parameters in a data set. This relationship is important for prediction and analysis. Regression Analysis is such a technique. This work mainly focuses on the different Regression Analysis models used nowadays and how they are used in context of different data sets. Picking the right model for analysis is often the most difficult task and therefore, these models are looked upon closely in this research. While a Linear Regression Analysis model is used to fit linear data, a Polynomial Regression Analysis model focuses on a data set representing polynomial relationship between data parameters. Logistic Regression model is used in a scenario where we need a binary type of prediction. When the data set becomes complex, these models may suffer from issues like Underfitting and Overfitting. Ridge and Lasso Regression are considered the best models to deal with this type of situation. Ridge regression is used when data suffers from multicollinearity, that is independent variables are highly correlated. Lasso regression differs from ridge regression in a way that it uses absolute values in the penalty function, instead of squares. Using these models in the right way and with right data set, Data Analysis and Prediction can produce the most accurate results.

La Statica delle Murature in pietra grezza,"Il tema di ricerca svolto nellâ€™ambito del Dottorato di Ricerca in Ingegneria delle Costruzioni e inerente le murature storiche con riferimento circa la statica delle murature in pietra grezza. Tale attivita, nel panorama nazionale ed internazionale, risulta di grande interesse proprio per lâ€™estrema diffusione di tale tipologia strutturale, afferente, per lo piu, alla casistica dei centri storici minori caratterizzati da unâ€™edilizia a carattere minuto molto povera. 
Le murature in pietrame grezzo meritevoli, quindi, di approfondimento nelle molteplici varianti a carattere regionale, sono argomento su cui e stato incentrato e sviluppato lâ€™intero percorso di ricerca finalizzato essenzialmente a ritracciare gli aspetti morfologico-costruttivi della cosi detta â€œregola dellâ€™arte muraria localeâ€, opportunamente declinata, in base alle possibilita offerte dai luoghi in esame, nonche il comportamento meccanico e la risposta per sollecitazioni di tipo orizzontali. 
La scala in cui si e operato e quella del singolo pannello murario, con riferimento diretto allâ€™ambito territoriale della provincia de Lâ€™Aquila, come esempio di unâ€™area ad alta sismicita duramente colpita da un recente evento tellurico, e quello Reggino, come scenario di danno di devastanti terremoti. Posto come punto di partenza lâ€™individuazione del tipo murario principale, lo studio di queste tipologie strutturali, complesse, e stato affrontato attraverso gli strumenti fornitici dalla letteratura di riferimento. Grande importanza e stata attribuita allo studio della Trattatistica, al fine di decifrare il ruolo meccanico dei singoli elementi costituenti e le logiche costruttive dellâ€™epoca. 
Unâ€™estesa, significativa, anche se non esaustiva, campagna sperimentale effettuata in situ e stata realizzata in collaborazione con le Universita di Genova, Perugia e Reggio Calabria, (rispettivamente rappresentate dai Proff. Sergio Lagomarsino e Serena Cattari, Antonio Borri e Michele Candela), finalizzata a quanto gia premesso. 
A fronte di codesta attivita e stato possibile rilevare i seguenti aspetti fondamentali:
ïƒ¼ Una differente risposta dei pannelli testati fuori dal piano, in funzione sia del discostarsi della fattura dellâ€™elemento dalla regola dellâ€™arte muraria, nonche in relazione alla specifica tecnica di consolidamento adottata; il tutto evidenziato in termini di resistenza, e quindi di forza necessaria ad attivare il meccanismo di ribaltamento indotto;
ïƒ¼ Lâ€™inserimento di elementi atti a migliorare lâ€™ingranamento nella sezione trasversale conferiscono un incremento in resistenza; tuttavia, per murature realizzate in pietrame grezzo non e sufficiente. Risulta fondamentale correggere il difetto di forma del pietrame non lavorato ripristinando la continuita di contatto fra gli elementi e quindi bisogna necessariamente rinforzare i paramenti attraverso lâ€™inserimento di brecce, scapoli e scagli, evitando cosi lâ€™arretramento del punto di cernierizzazione;
ïƒ¼ Lâ€™esecuzione di una rinzeppatura profonda in luogo di quella superficiale modifica profondamente il comportamento del pannello certificando cosi lâ€™effettivo ruolo meccanico di questi elementi nellâ€™organizzazione complessiva e quindi la capacita degli stessi di dare monoliticita al pannello;
ïƒ¼ Lâ€™insufficienza dei modelli meccanici forza-spostamento del tipo bilineare rigido-degradante presenti in letteratura. 
Per cio concerne specificatamente le murature Aquilane, queste hanno mostrato, indipendentemente dalla tecnica di consolidamento adottata una pseudo duttilita dovuta allâ€™ingranamento per forma fra le parti. E stata registrata, inoltre, una pseudo elasticita di partenza dovuta allâ€™imperfetto monolitismo fra le parti ed alla possibilita di sviluppare attrito allâ€™interfaccia fra gli elementi; condizione tuttavia, da ritenersi normale vista la natura composita del materiale muratura.
ïƒ¼ Impossibilita dellâ€™assunzione come ipotesi di base del comportamento perfettamente monolatero ed infinitamente resistente a compressione del materiale muratura. Si propone lâ€™introduzione di un parametro aggiuntivo, lâ€™ingranamento per forma degli elementi.
Per tutto quanto innanzi, e stato proposto un modello meccanico maggiormente rispondente ai risultati individuati, che denota un andamento trilineare, mostrando una pseudoelasticita di partenza, ed una successiva pseudo duttilita dovuta alla parzializzazione della sezione in conseguenza a piccoli scorrimenti interni, decoesioni, nonche ad un progressivo sviluppo di deformazioni anelastiche nelle porzioni reagenti, fino al superamento dellâ€™ingranamento per forma degli elementi costituenti, nonche la disarticolazione del pannello sino allo spostamento ultimo ed alla conseguente attivazione del meccanismo di collasso esaminato.",2013,
"External Genitalia Gangrene: Clinical, Therapeutic Aspects and Prognosis at University Hospital Souro Sanou of Bobo Dioulasso (Burkina Faso)","Objective: To describe the clinical aspects and the management of external genitalia gangrene in the Urology department of the Bobo Dioulasso CHUSS. Patients and methods: This was a retrospective and descriptive study over a period of 6 years from January 2011 to December 2016, which covered 54 patients hospitalized in the urology department of the University Hospital Souro Sanou for external genitalia gangrene. Results: The mean age of our patients was 53.8 years. The large ulcero-necrosis of scrotum was the main reason for reference. Our patients consulted on average 8.23 days after the onset of symptomatology. A risk factor was found in 44.2% of cases and a cause was identified in 65.3% of patients. A urogenital cause was present in 32.7%. Probabilistic antibiotic therapy and medical reanimation were systematic at admission. Debridement was performed on average 18 hours after admission and 10 patients had more than one debridement. We noted a mortality rate of 5.5%. Conclusion: Fournierâ€™s gangrene is a serious infectious disease whose diagnosis is often delayed in our context. Early surgical debridement remains the essential therapeutic gesture to reduce mortality.",2017,Open Journal of Urology
Variable Selection in High-dimensional Varying-coefficient Models with Global Optimality,"The varying-coefficient model is flexible and powerful for modeling the dynamic changes of regression coefficients. It is important to identify significant covariates associated with response variables, especially for high-dimensional settings where the number of covariates can be larger than the sample size. We consider model selection in the high-dimensional setting and adopt difference convex programming to approximate the L0 penalty, and we investigate the global optimality properties of the varying-coefficient estimator. The challenge of the variable selection problem here is that the dimension of the nonparametric form for the varying-coefficient modeling could be infinite, in addition to dealing with the high-dimensional linear covariates. We show that the proposed varying-coefficient estimator is consistent, enjoys the oracle property and achieves an optimal convergence rate for the non-zero nonparametric components for high-dimensional data. Our simulations and numerical examples indicate that the difference convex algorithm is efficient using the coordinate decent algorithm, and is able to select the true model at a higher frequency than the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), the adaptive LASSO and the smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) approaches.",2012,J.

Habitat structure affect abundances of labrid fishes across temperate reefs in south-western Australia,"We tested the effect of reef complexity (number of small vs. large topographic elements,<1Â m and >1Â m, respectively), and composition of macroalgae (cover of the kelp Ecklonia radiata, fucalean and red algae) on the abundance patterns of labrid fishes across ~800Â km of coastline in south-western Australia. Fishes and habitat attributes were visually counted at 12 reefs visited at four times over 1Â year. Five labrids (Austrolabrus maculatus, Coris auricularis, Notolabrus parilus, Ophthalmolepis lineolata and Pseudolabrus biseralis) were frequently observed (>20% of counts), while three species (Bodianus axillaris, Choerodon rubescens and Thalassoma lutescens) were rarely censused (< 6%). Patterns of abundance were generally affected by two descriptors of the habitat structure: the number of small topographic elements (100Â mâˆ’2), and the percentage of red algal cover. Most species showed a tendency for an increase in their abundances with an increase in the number of small topographic elements and cover of red algae. The patterns likely reflect an underlying correlation between habitat structure and prey accessibility and lowered predation risk.",2009,Environmental Biology of Fishes
"Notes on an expedition to relocate the Madagascar Pochard Aythya innotata - a JWPT, WWF, WWT project","The island of Madagascar lies off the east coast of Africa and is host to ten species of wildfowl of which three are full endemics (Johnsgard 1978). The three endemic ducks have been little studied but all have declined in recent years, two now being listed in the Red Data Book (Collar & Stuart 1985). One species, Bernierâ€™s Teal Anas bernieri from West Madagascar was the focus of a Wildfowl Trust field survey in 1973 (Scott & Lubbock 1974). The Madagascar Pochard Aythya innotata is apparently restricted to the area around Lake Alaotra in the northeast (Dee 1986). This lake is the largest on the island and the duck was considered common in 1929 (Delacour 1932). In recent years, however, sightings have become increasingly fewer, the last reported on Alaotra was in 1960 (Dee 1986). Surveys in 1982 and 1987 failed to locate the Pochard (Langrand 1988). The lake is large and difficult to survey and it was in order to assess fully the situation at Alaotra that a thorough survey was considered necessary. Delacour had described a lake well vegetated with water lilies and extensive beds of papyrus and Phragmites, broken by a network of pools and channels (Delacour 1966). Today, the lake area supports an escalating human population dependent upon rice-growing. Huge tracts of papyrus marsh are continuing to disappear to make new rice fields and grazing for Zebu cattle and pigs. The surrounding hillsides have been extensively deforested, resulting in rapid soil erosion and the silting up and increased turbidity of the lake. Sport hunting of wildfowl, a comÂ­ mon practice during Madagascarâ€™s French coÂ­ lonial period, has been replaced by subsistence trapping of all aquatic birds. Intensive fishing throughout the lake, including the use of gillnets, has also affected bird populations. The most significant recent ecological change has followed the introduction of exotic fish, particularly Tilapia in 1955 (Burgis & Symoens 1987). This fishâ€™s voracious appetite has deÂ­ stroyed large areas of the aquatic vegetation, particularly the water lilies and with them the associated food chains, resulting in the loss of several species of bird. Notably absent was the Madagascan sub-species of the White-backed Duck Thalassornis leuconotus insularis. The expedition to Alaotra was planned folÂ­ lowing discussions with Olivier Langrand of World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) Aires ProtÃ©gÃ©Ã©s, Madagascar and Lucienne WilmÃ©. Permission to conduct fieldwork and the proÂ­ vision of local assistance was granted through the Accord signed between the Madagascan authorities and the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust (JWPT). Air tickets and the freighting of an outboard engine were provided by British Airways Assisting Nature Conservation. The Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust (WWT) also proÂ­ vided financial support. Seven weeks were spent at the lake ( 1 October to 15 November 1989) concentrating on the extensive reedbeds at the lakeâ€™s southern end. The open lake proved virtually useless for wildfowl. The north was being surveyed by WilmÃ©. Time was split between Ambatosoratra on the eastern shore and the fishing village of Anororo on the west. We worked, with our guides, by using a small motor boat for towing dug-out canoes across open water and then transferring to these to penetrate deep into the papyrus beds. Discussions with local inhabitants were made each day, and to aid these, a questionnaire about the Pochard had been produced by WilmÃ© and written in Malgash. However, dialogue with local fishermen and hunters gave little ground for optimism that the duck still survived. People of middle age could provide good bioÂ­ logical information on A. innotata but spoke of its disappearance some years before. The surÂ­ veyâ€™s findings support this view, since no Pochard were seen throughout the survey. The Madagascar Pochard was kept in capÂ­ tivity before World War II and proved relatively",1990,
â€œHybrids of Birds and Bats with a Decidedly Reptilian Flavorâ€,"â€œUnlike their dinosaur cousins, pteroâˆ’ saurs have never really made a sensaâˆ’ tional popular or academic splashâ€; Witton provides â€œan overview of the diversity and sheer awesomenessâ€ of his subject (Preface), and some 200 ilâˆ’ lustrations. He begins with a â€œpopular view of primordial Earthâ€, â€œBut Thatâ€™s All Hokumâ€, and pterosaurs â€œhave sufâˆ’ fered more than mostâ€ in being misunâˆ’ derstood. Apart from powered flight, â€œthey were also skilled walkers, runners, and swimmersâ€. The overview â€œis split into three partsâ€: their general palaeobiology is assessed, â€œlooking at their anatomy, locomotion, and other generâˆ’ alities of their lifestyleâ€. Chapters 9 to 24 are per pterosaur group, often per family. Chapter 25 â€œponder[s] their evolutionary storyâ€ and demise. Why extinction? â€œLate Cretaceous pterosaur stock was almost entirely invested in one, slowly adapting lineage and was therefore very vulnerableâ€ (p. 263), although â€œdiversity curves [...] reflect sampling biasesâ€ (p. 259). Witton has â€œmade a case for pterosaurs as diverse, successful animals that are as far away from their stereotype of Mesozoic garâˆ’ goyles as could be imaginedâ€ (p. 259). He is rightly cautious about some taxonomical revisions (e.g., p. 174) or the state of nomenclaâˆ’ ture (e.g., p. 152). His own (re)positioning of taxa is wellâˆ’argued (e.g., p. 188). So are his reinterpretations; e.g., he finds that only Pterodaustro, among pterosaurs, is a true filter feeder, pace such authors who consider other derived ctenochasmatids to also have been ones (p. 199): â€œtheir jaws lack the specializations required for straining food from the water column. Rather, their elongate, broad jaw tips and meshing teeth seem much better suited for tacâˆ’ tileâˆ’feeding strategiesâ€ (p. 199). Witton discusses the evidence in detail. Also consider, e.g., his reasoning (p. 209) about why dsungariâˆ’ pteroids developed shockâˆ’absorbing characteristics: the mass of their compact, hardy skeleton is a likely cause, not necessarily Fastnachtâ€™s hypothesis that frequent landing on hard ground caused this. Witton is clever at explaining complexity. He conveys the state of the art, not infrequently with original insights. He also explains well controversies, e.g., the criticism of the skimâˆ’feeding hypothesis even in Thalassodromeus (pp. 242â€“243). Witton argues against a sailâˆ’like membrane extending beâˆ’ tween the antlers of Nyctosaurus (p. 178). Contra Wang et al. (2008: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA 105: 1983â€“1987), Witton finds it â€œlikely that Nemicolopterus is a very young, perhaps an even recently hatched, tapejaridâ€ (p. 219). Also note Wittonâ€™s reasoning about the thermoregulatory crest hyâˆ’ pothesis (p. 242); he denies that they were primarily developed for that role, his analogue being heatâˆ’loosing bird beaks (p. 242). Rather than proposing a complete taxonomy or a phylogenâˆ’ etic tree (cf. p. 261) right away, Witton explains his approach as the exposition proceeds. Wisely, he does not bother to give inâˆ’ termediate taxa between Pterosauria and the family level, a named rank: relative position suffices. Superordinate taxa apâˆ’ pear under chapter titles, e.g., pterosauria > monofenestrata > pterodactyloidea > lophocratia > azhdarchoidea > tapejaridae. Witton only quite seldom resorts to cladograms, but his diaâˆ’ grams, and especially his biomechanical depictions, are sophisâˆ’ ticated, eloquent, and pleasing. He is a really gifted illustrator, with in addition a talent for interspersing dense technical text with apt humour. A fullâˆ’page life restoration facing the opening of Chapter 25 has this caption: â€œRealizing that the next chapter is about pterosaur extinction, a flock of the Maastrichtian Romaâˆ’ nian pterosaur Hatzegoteryx thambema tries to fly back to an earlier part of the book to avoid the chop.â€ The presentation is often lightâˆ’hearted, but always rigorously sound. Sporadic informal expressions include: anurognathids are â€œMuppetâˆ’facedâ€ (p. 105); â€œa heck of a lotâ€ (p. 109); â€œOops.â€ (p. 128); â€œThe eyes of tapejarid aficionados were turned east in 2003, whenâ€ (p. 219); â€œRecycling, Mesozoic styleâ€ (p. 144); â€œNo one messes with the 6 m wingspan Ornithocheirusâ€ (p. 158); â€œWith perhaps one exception, diddlyâˆ’squat has been said in print about the biomechanics and functional biology of boreopteridsâ€ (p. 167); â€œWhile the smaller individuals with more sensible headâˆ’ crestsâ€ (p. 171); â€œgoofy teethâ€, â€œsilly hatâ€, â€œThis is not a jokeâ€ (all three on p. 184); â€œbetter candidates for appearing on the front cover of rock music albumsâ€ (p. 202); â€œTupandactylus imperator doing his best Clint Eastwood impressionâ€ (p. 217); â€œThereâ€™s nothing quite like an azhdarchid.â€ (p. 255); â€œThe end. Any pteroâˆ’ saur alive in the last weekend of the Mesozoic would have seen the Earth plunged into a shortâˆ’lived nuclear winterâ€ (p. 260); â€œPteroâˆ’ saurs were already on their last dance by this stageâ€ (p. 260); â€œleft carrying their torchâ€ (p. 260).

Group Guided Fused Laplacian Sparse Group Lasso for Modeling Alzheimer's Disease Progression,"As the largest cause of dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD) has brought serious burdens to patients and their families, mostly in the financial, psychological, and emotional aspects. In order to assess the progression of AD and develop new treatment methods for the disease, it is essential to infer the trajectories of patients' cognitive performance over time to identify biomarkers that connect the patterns of brain atrophy and AD progression. In this article, a structured regularized regression approach termed group guided fused Laplacian sparse group Lasso (GFL-SGL) is proposed to infer disease progression by considering multiple prediction of the same cognitive scores at different time points (longitudinal analysis). The proposed GFL-SGL simultaneously exploits the interrelated structures within the MRI features and among the tasks with sparse group Lasso (SGL) norm and presents a novel group guided fused Laplacian (GFL) regularization. This combination effectively incorporates both the relatedness among multiple longitudinal time points with a general weighted (undirected) dependency graphs and useful inherent group structure in features. Furthermore, an alternating direction method of multipliers- (ADMM-) based algorithm is also derived to optimize the nonsmooth objective function of the proposed approach. Experiments on the dataset from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) show that the proposed GFL-SGL outperformed some other state-of-the-art algorithms and effectively fused the multimodality data. The compact sets of cognition-relevant imaging biomarkers identified by our approach are consistent with the results of clinical studies.",2020,Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine

Characterization of bacterial hydrocarbon degradation of the Red Sea,This book is a scientific study on the hydrocarbon degradation potential of the Red Sea. Metagenomic analysis platform was establish in order to investigate the microbial community for the presence of hydrocarbon related metabolism genes. In parallel oil enriched microcosms were established from which was possible to isolate hydrocarbon degraders bacteria typical of the Red Sea. Eventually the community of the microcosms was analyzed after the enrichment and successively compared with the metagenomic data from the pristine water of the Red Sea. Presented here is also the characterization of bacteria from genera Alcanivorax and Thalassospira representing the former a novel species and the latter an ecotype typical from the Red Sea.,2018,
Ridge Regression and Lasso Estimators for Data Analysis,"An important problem in data science and statistical learning is to predict an outcome based on data collected on several predictor variables. This is generally known as a regression problem. In the field of big data studies, the regression model often depends on a large number of predictor variables. The data scientist is often dealing with the difficult task of determining the most appropriate set of predictor variables to be employed in the regression model. In this thesis we adopt a technique that constraints the coefficient estimates which in effect shrinks the coefficient estimates towards zero. Ridge regression and lasso are two well-known methods for shrinking the coefficients towards zero. These two methods are investigated in this thesis. Ridge regression and lasso techniques are compared by analyzing a real data set for a regression model with a large collection of predictor variables.",2019,
PAC-5 Gene Expression Signature for Predicting Prognosis of Patients with Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma,"Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAC) is one of the most aggressive malignancies. Intratumoural molecular heterogeneity impedes improvement of the overall survival rate. Current pathological staging system is not sufficient to accurately predict prognostic outcomes. Thus, accurate prognostic model for patient survival and treatment decision is demanded. Using differentially expressed gene analysis between normal pancreas and PAC tissues, the cancer-specific genes were identified. A prognostic gene expression model was computed by LASSO regression analysis. The PAC-5 signature (LAMA3, E2F7, IFI44, SLC12A2, and LRIG1) that had significant prognostic value in the overall dataset was established, independently of the pathological stage. We provided evidence that the PAC-5 signature further refined the selection of the PAC patients who might benefit from postoperative therapies. SLC12A2 and LRIG1 interacted with the proteins that were implicated in resistance of EGFR kinase inhibitor. DNA methylation was significantly involved in the gene regulations of the PAC-5 signature. The PAC-5 signature provides new possibilities for improving the personalised therapeutic strategies. We suggest that the PAC-5 genes might be potential drug targets for PAC.",2019,Cancers
Statistical Methods for Sequence-Based Microbial Community Assays,"Scientific abstract Compositional data consist of vectors of proportions normalized to a constant sum from an unconstrained basis. The sum constraint makes inference on correlations between basis features challenging due to the information loss from normalization. However, such correlations are of long-standing interest in fields including ecology. We propose a novel Bayesian framework (BAnOCC: Bayesian Analysis of Compositional Covariance) to estimate a sparse precision matrix through a LASSO prior. The resulting posterior, generated by MCMC sampling, allows uncertainty quantification of any function of the precision matrix, including the correlation matrix. We also use a first-order Taylor expansion to approximate the transformation from the basis to the composition in order to investigate what characteristics of the basis can make the correlations more or less difficult to infer. On simulated datasets, we show that BAnOCC infers the true network as well as previous methods while offering the advantage of posterior inference. Larger and more realistic simulated datasets further showed that BAnOCC performs well as measured by type I and type II error rates. Finally, we apply BAnOCC to a microbial ecology dataset from the Human Micro5 biome Project, which in addition to reproducing established ecological results revealed unique, competition-based roles for Proteobacteria in multiple distinct habitats. Lay summary Data from many fields are available primarily in the form of proportions, also referred to as compositions, which impose mathematical constraints on identifying interactions among components in the underlying systems. In particular, correlations cannot be calculated directly from proportions or from count data that give rise to them. Methods that work around this difficulty generally do so by imposing strong assumptions about the distribution of underlying data or associated correlations, and these in turn often prevent quantifying uncertainty in the resulting estimates of correlation. We developed a statistical model (BAnOCC: Bayesian Analysis of Compositional Covariance) that both estimates correlations between counts or proportions and provides a posterior distribution for each correlation that quantifies how uncertain the estimate is. BAnOCC does well at controlling the number of false positives in simulated data and can be practically applied to a wide range of proportional data types. 1.",2017,
A Novel DNA Methylation-Based Signature Can Predict the Responses of MGMT Promoter Unmethylated Glioblastomas to Temozolomide,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most malignant glioma, with a median overall survival (OS) of 14-16 months. Temozolomide (TMZ) is the first-line chemotherapy drug for glioma, but whether TMZ should be withheld from patients with GBMs that lack O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation is still under debate. DNA methylation profiling holds great promise for further stratifying the responses of MGMT promoter unmethylated GBMs to TMZ. In this study, we studied 147 TMZ-treated MGMT promoter unmethylated GBM, whose methylation information was obtained from the HumanMethylation27 (HM-27K) BeadChips (n = 107) and the HumanMethylation450 (HM-450K) BeadChips (n = 40) for training and validation, respectively. In the training set, we performed univariate Cox regression and identified that 3,565 CpGs were significantly associated with the OS of the TMZ-treated MGMT promoter unmethylated GBMs. Functional analysis indicated that the genes corresponding to these CpGs were enriched in the biological processes or pathways of mitochondrial translation, cell cycle, and DNA repair. Based on these CpGs, we developed a 31-CpGs methylation signature utilizing the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression algorithm. In both training and validation datasets, the signature identified the TMZ-sensitive GBMs in the MGMT promoter unmethylated GBMs, and only the patients in the low-risk group appear to benefit from the TMZ treatment. Furthermore, these identified TMZ-sensitive MGMT promoter unmethylated GBMs have a similar OS when compared with the MGMT promoter methylated GBMs after TMZ treatment in both two datasets. Multivariate Cox regression demonstrated the independent prognostic value of the signature in TMZ-treated MGMT promoter unmethylated GBMs. Moreover, we also noticed that the hallmark of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, ECM related biological processes and pathways were highly enriched in the MGMT unmethylated GBMs with the high-risk score, indicating that enhanced ECM activities could be involved in the TMZ-resistance of GBM. In conclusion, our findings promote our understanding of the roles of DNA methylation in MGMT umethylated GBMs and offer a very promising TMZ-sensitivity predictive signature for these GBMs that could be tested prospectively.",2019,Frontiers in Genetics
The Bar and the Bench as Agents of Consumer Advocacy in Nigeria,"The complexity of the production process, the sophistication and quantity of products and services churned out daily and the glaring inequality in bargaining power between the consumer and the producer and provider of goods and services underline the need for consumer advocacy. Consumer advocacy is â€œthe process of standing beside an individual or group and speaking out on their behalf to protect and promote their rights and interestsâ€™â€™ in the area of goods and services. An advocate may be an individual (such as a friend, a family member, a lawyer, etc) or an organization (such as a trade or professionalassociation, governmental agency, a non-governmental organization, etc.). This paper examines the role of one of such organizations, the Nigerian Bar. It argues that given the prideof place the legal profession enjoys in the society, the bar and the bench needs to be more proactive in the area of consumeradvocacy.",2018,
Variable selection in quantile regression when the models have autoregressive errors,"Abstract This paper considers a problem of variable selection in quantile regression with autoregressive errors. Recently, Wu and Liu (2009) investigated the oracle properties of the SCAD and adaptive-LASSO penalized quantile regressions under non identical but independent error assumption. We further relax the error assumptions so that the regression model can hold autoregressive errors, and then investigate theoretical properties for our proposed penalized quantile estimators under the relaxed assumption. Optimizing the objective function is often challenging because both quantile loss and penalty functions may be non-differentiable and/or non-concave. We adopt the concept of pseudo data by Oh etÂ al. (2007) to implement a practical algorithm for the quantile estimate. In addition, we discuss the convergence property of the proposed algorithm. The performance of the proposed method is compared with those of the majorization-minimization algorithm (Hunter and Li, 2005) and the difference convex algorithm (Wu and Liu, 2009) through numerical and real examples.",2014,Journal of The Korean Statistical Society

Methods for analyzing signal characteristics of stable and unstable rotors in a realistic heart model,"Atrial fibrillation is a common irregular heart rhythm. Until today there is still a need for research to quantify typical signal characteristics of rotors, which can induce atrial fibrillation. In this work, signal characteristics of a stable and a more unstable rotor in a realistic heart model including fiber orientation were analyzed with the following methods: peak-to-peak amplitude, Hilbert phase, approximate entropy and RS-difference. In this simulation model the stable rotor rotated with a cycle length of 145 ms and stayed in an area of 1.5 mm x 3 mm. Another more unstable rotor with a cycle length of 190 ms moved in an area of 10 mm Ã— 4 mm. In a distance of 2 mm to the rotor tip, the peak-to-peak amplitude decreased significantly, whereas the RS-difference and the approximate entropy were maximal. The rotor center trajectories were detected by phase singularity points determined by the Hilbert transform. We showed that more unstable rotors resulted in more amplitude changes over time and also the cycle length differed more. Furthermore, we presented typical activation time patterns of the Lasso catheter centered at the rotor tip and in different distances to the rotor tip. We suggest that cardiologists use a combination of the described methods to determine a rotor tip position in a more robust manner.",2015,2015 Computing in Cardiology Conference (CinC)

Reduced-rank multi-label classification,"Multi-label classification is a natural generalization of the classical binary classification for classifying multiple class labels. It differs from multi-class classification in that the multiple class labels are not exclusive. The key challenge is to improve the classification accuracy by incorporating the intrinsic dependency structure among the multiple class labels. In this article we propose to model the dependency structure via a reduced-rank multi-label classification model, and to enforce a group lasso regularization for sparse estimation. An alternative optimization scheme is developed to facilitate the computation, where a constrained manifold optimization technique and a gradient descent algorithm are alternated to maximize the resultant regularized log-likelihood. Various simulated examples and two real applications are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. More importantly, its asymptotic behavior is quantified in terms of the estimation and variable selection consistencies, as well as the model selection consistency via the Bayesian information criterion.",2017,Statistics and Computing
LASSO estimation of threshold autoregressive models,"This paper develops a novel approach for estimating a threshold autoregressive (TAR) model with multiple-regimes and establishes its large sample properties. By reframing the problem in a regression variable selection context, a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) procedure is proposed to estimate a TAR model with an unknown number of thresholds, where the computation can be performed efficiently. It is further shown that the number and the location of the thresholds can be consistently estimated. A near optimal convergence rate of the threshold parameters is also established. Simulation studies are conducted to assess the performance in finite samples. The results are illustrated with an application to the quarterly US real GNP data over the period 1947â€“2009.",2015,Journal of Econometrics
A Multi-Resolution Spatio-Temporal Model for Brain Activation and Connectivity in fMRI Data,"Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is a primary modality for studying brain activity. Modeling spatial dependence of imaging data at different scales is one of the main challenges of contemporary neuroimaging, and it could allow for accurate testing for significance in neural activity. The high dimensionality of this type of data (on the order of hundreds of thousands of voxels) poses serious modeling challenges and considerable computational constraints. For the sake of feasibility, standard models typically reduce dimensionality by modeling covariance among regions of interest (ROIs) -- coarser or larger spatial units -- rather than among voxels. However, ignoring spatial dependence at different scales could drastically reduce our ability to detect activation patterns in the brain and hence produce misleading results. To overcome these problems, we introduce a multi-resolution spatio-temporal model and a computationally efficient methodology to estimate cognitive control related activation and whole-brain connectivity. The proposed model allows for testing voxel-specific activation while accounting for non-stationary local spatial dependence within anatomically defined ROIs, as well as regional dependence (between-ROIs). Furthermore, the model allows for detection of interpretable connectivity patterns among ROIs using the graphical Least Absolute Shrinkage Selection Operator (LASSO). The model is used in a motor-task fMRI study to investigate brain activation and connectivity patterns aimed at identifying associations between these patterns and regaining motor functionality following a stroke.",2016,arXiv: Applications
"Correspondence between assemblages of coral reef fishes and gradients of water motion, depth, and substrate size off Puerto Rico","Censuses were taken at 8 coral reefs in southwest Puerto Rico to identlfy assemblages of flshes and to determine whether water motion, depth, and substrate were correlated with fish distributlon and abundance. Each reef was sampled by recording species and abundance of fishes and substrate sizes within quadrats placed at different depths (from reef crest to an average of 6 m deep) along transects placed on forereefs and backreefs. Water motion was examined by measuring the amount of dissolution of plaster-of-Paris blocks wh~ch gave a relative index of the degree of water movement wlthin and among reefs. Data collected on 14 fish specles and measurements of water motion, degree of reef slope, and 4 sizes of substrate over 32 transects were analyzed to identify species groups and examine ecological correlates. The analyses indicated 3 species assemblages which d~ffered in distnbution and abundance within reefs (backreef, shallow forereef, and deep forereef) and among reefs (nearshore, intermediate, and offshore reefs). Similarly, water movement, depth, reef slope and substrate size occurred as gradients that differed significantly within and among reefs. Fishes in Assemblage 1 included primarily Ophioblennius atlanticus. Thalassoma bifasciatum, Stegastes dorsopunicans, and Microspathodon chrysurus. These species were most common on the shallow forereef, particularly at offshore reefs (those farthest from land); these sites were characterized by a high degree of water motion, gentle forereef slope, and boulder-sized substrate. Assemblage 2 species included Stegastesplanifrons, Hypoplectrus chlorurus, and Holocentrus rufus. These fishes were most abundant on the deep forereef, especially at nearshore reefs (sites closest to land), which were typified by relatively low water movement, steep slope, and smaller substrate sizes. Fishes in Assemblage 3 (Stegastes leucostictus and Malacoctenus macropus) were most numerous in the backreef where water motion, slope inclination, and substrate sizes were minimal compared with the forereef. While biological variables are undoubtedly important in determining species distributions, the different assemblages were found to be correlated with variations in water motion, depth, and substrate type. These 3 physical variables occurred as interrelated gradients, but the analyses suggested that water movement energy was the environmental factor most strongly associated with species distributions.",1994,Marine Ecology Progress Series

Contribution De La Technologie Du Biodigesteur a La Durabilite Des Exploitations Agricoles Familiales Au Burkina Faso,"Despite problems related to energy, biomass reduction, grazing degradation, decreased soil fertility, environmental fragility, the biodigester is positioned as a strategy of adaptation and transformation of production systems with the association of agriculture and livestock. The biodigester is an underground construction that uses cow dung or pork excrement mixed with water to produce biogas for cooking and lighting and effluent compost for soil fertilization. The study aimed to evaluate the contribution of the Biodigester technology to agro-ecological sustainability, socio-territorial sustainability and socio-economic sustainability. The study was undertaken in November 2015 in the municipalities of Bobo Dioulasso, Kaya-Barsalgo and Dori. The individual survey was conducted in twenty-four (24) villages on a sample of 166 heads of farms. The results showed the contribution of biodigester technology to agro-ecological, socio-territorial and socio-economic sustainability. Furthermore, land security, the cost of installing the infrastructure, insufficiency or scarcity of cow dung at certain times of the year, lack of water remain the main limits of adoption of the Biodigester technology. The biodigester is an appropriate technology capable of solving the economic, agricultural and energy questions faced by households.",2017,

None of the studies was specifically designed to evaluate prospectively the effect of altering MA on more clinically relevant renal endpoints such as advanced CKD or ESRD.

Nearest-neighbour ensembles in lasso feature subspaces,"The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) is a promising feature selection technique. However, it has traditionally not been a focus of research in ensemble classification methods. In this study, the authors propose a robust classification algorithm that makes use of an ensemble of classifiers in lasso feature subspaces. The algorithm consists of two stages: the first is a lasso-based multiple feature subsets selection cycle, which tries to find a number of relevant and diverse feature subspaces; the second is an ensemble-based decision system that intends to preserve the classification performance in case of abrupt changes in the representation space. Experimental results on the two-class textured image segmentation problem prove the effectiveness of the proposed classification method.",2010,Iet Computer Vision
"3rd IMA Conference on Numerical Linear Algebra and Optimisation September 10-12, 2012, Birmingham, United Kingdom Mini-Symposium: Gradient Methods for Large-Scale Optimisation Organizer:","Michel Baes (ETH Zurich) First-order methods for eigenvalue minimization Many semidefinite programming problems encountered in practice can be recast as minimizing the maximal eigenvalue of a convex combination of symmetric matrices. In this talk, we describe and analyze a series of first-order methods for solving this problem when the input matrices are large (of dimension 1000 to 10000 and more) and mildly sparse. We propose in this talk several accelerating strategies of optimal first-order methods. A first procedure consists in adopting an aggressive step-size selection in an appropriate smoothing technique, a strategy which proves to be particularly efficient for large-size problems. The second procedure is motivated by the fact that the fastest first-order methods for eigenvalue minimization require the computation of a matrix exponential at every iteration. We develop a randomized strategy to accelerate the computation of these exponentials, while maintaining strong probabilistic guarantees on the outcome of our algorithm. We show theoretically and experimentally that this method is faster than all the standard existing methods on a certain set of instances. Guillaume Obozinski (INRIA) Structured sparsity: successes and open challenges The broadly used L1 regularization is initially motivated as providing a convex surrogate to the penalization of the number of non-zero coefficients in a model. It leads to nonsmooth optimization problems, which can however be solved quite efficiently by first-order methods. The last years have seen the emergence of the field of structured sparsity, which aims at identifying a model of small complexity, when the latter is not measured merely by the number of its nonzero parameters but by a more general complexity measure of the patterns formed by these ``selected"" parameters. Various convex regularizations have been proposed that formalized the notion that prior information can be expressed through functions encoding the set of possible or encouraged patterns. The convex optimization problems arising in this setting have interesting characteristics from the point of view of algorithmic design: they are non-differentiable optimization problems, but they present structures, symmetries and partial separability properties that in many cases allow for efficient algorithms based on first order methods: in particular, proximal methods have been applied successfully to a certain number of these problems including groups sparsity, hierarchical sparsity and sparsity with overlap. In this talk, I will present a new unifying point of view to structured sparsity, which, given any combinatorial function encoding the structured a priori, constructs a convex regularizer with the fundamental property that it provides the tightest convex relaxation to that penalty. Such tight regularizers are in many cases different from the ones that have been considered in the literature and come with new computational challenges: proximal methods and other state-of-the-art first order methods are not so easily applicable to them. In the particular case, where the combinatorial function is submodular however, I will show that the computation of the proximal operator can be done efficiently, hence leading to efficient algorithms. Peter RichtÃ¡rik (Edinburgh) Parallel block coordinate descent methods for huge-scale partially separable problems In this work we show that randomized block coordinate descent methods can be accelerated by parallelization when applied to the problem of minimizing the sum of a partially block separable smooth convex function and a simple block separable convex function. We give a generic algorithm and several variants thereof based on the way parallel computation is performed. In all cases we prove iteration complexity results, i.e., we give bounds on the number of iterations sufficient to approximately solve the problem with high probability. Our results generalize the intuitive observation that in the separable case the theoretical speedup caused by parallelization must be equal to the number of processors. We show that the speedup increases with the number of processors and with the degree of partial separability of the smooth component of the objective function. Our analysis also works in the mode when the number of blocks being updated at each iteration is random, which allows for modelling situations with variable (busy or unreliable) number of processors. We conclude with some encouraging computational results applied to huge-scale LASSO and sparse SVM instances. Raphael Hauser (Oxford) Sequential compressed sensing We introduce a nonlinear sparse optimisation problem that arises in medical imaging and discuss an algorithm for its solution based on an iterative sequence of compressed sensing problems. Martin TakÃ¡Ä (Edinburgh) Distributed block coordinate descent method: iteration complexity and efficient hybrid implementation In this work we propose solving huge-scale instances of regularized convex minimization problems using a distributed block coordinate descent method. We analyze the iteration complexity of the (synchronous) algorithm and show how it depends on the way the problem data is partitioned to the nodes. Several variations of the basic method are obtained based on the way updates are handled (P2P, broadcasting, asynchronicity). Finally, we report encouraging numerical results for an efficient hybrid MPI + Open MP implementation applied to LASSO and sparse support vector machine instances. Xuan Vinh Doan (Warwick) A proximal point algorithm for sequential feature extraction applications We propose a proximal point algorithm to solve a problem that can be used to extract features in data. We use a modified alternating direction method to generate good starting points and then use the accelerated proximal gradient method in each iteration of the main algorithm. We also develop new stopping criteria for the proximal point algorithm, which is based on optimality conditions of epsilon-optimal solutions, with a theoretical guarantee. We test our algorithm with two image databases and show that we can use the proposed algorithm to extract appropriate common features from these images. This is joint work with Kim-Chuan Toh and Stephen Vavasis. Carola-Bibiane SchÃ¶nlieb (Cambridge) Domain decomposition for total variation regularisation and applications Domain decomposition methods were introduced as techniques for solving partial differential equations based on a decomposition of the spatial domain of the problem into several subdomains. The initial equation restricted to the subdomains defines a sequence of new local problems. The main goal is to solve the initial equation via the solution of the local problems. This procedure induces a dimension reduction which is the major responsible of the success of such a method. Indeed, one of the principal motivations is the formulation of solvers which can be easily parallelized. In this presentation we shall develop a domain decomposition algorithm to the minimization of functionals with total variation constraints. In this case the interesting solutions may be discontinuous, e.g., along curves in 2D. These discontinuities may cross the interfaces of the domain decomposition patches. Hence, the crucial difficulty is the correct treatment of interfaces, with the preservation of crossing discontinuities and the correct matching where the solution is continuous instead. I will present our domain decomposition strategy, including convergence results for the algorithm and numerical examples for its application in image inpainting and magnetic resonance imaging. Rachael Tappenden (Edinburgh) Block coordinate descent applied to multistage stochastic optimization Recently there has been much interest in block coordinate descent methods because of their ability to tackle large-scale optimization problems. Multistage stochastic programming problems are an example of very large optimization problems (where the size of the problem grows rapidly with the number of scenarios and time horizon) that display particular structure and sparsity patterns, namely, dual block angular structure. This work considers a scenario decomposition approach to multistage stochastic optimization and the application of the block coordinate descent method to determine the solution of the subproblems. Preliminary numerical results will also be presented.",2012,
[Clinical experiences with cooled radiofrequency ablation of ectopic atrial tachycardia employing an electroanatomic mapping system].,"Due to its variable origin success for ablation of ectopic atrial tachycardia (EAT) has been difficult to achieve using conventional mapping and ablation strategies. In contrast, no information in the literature is available about the use of a nonfluoroscopic, 3-dimensional electroanatomic mapping system (CARTO) combined with the cooled ablation technology creating deeper lesions in experimental studies compared to standard catheters. In 20 consecutive patients (15 female; age 52.5 +/- 15.4 years), a single focus responsible for clinical EAT has been mapped. Twelve EATs were located in the right atrium, whereas 8 foci were left sided including 3 origins within a pulmonary vein (PV). Due to the reported development of PV stenosis in the ablative treatment of focal atrial fibrillation, direct ablation applied inside the PV was avoided. Instead, PV-disconnection achieved by the use of a Lasso trade mark catheter in 1 case and by circumferential ablation around the PV in 2 other patients was preferred. In 2 patients, ablation was not attempted because of an origin located directly in the area of the atrioventricular node. In another case, CARTO mapping was stopped due to persistent mechanical termination of the tachycardia with no possibility of reinduction. In the latter, ablation was performed in sinus rhythm at the earliest mapped site before terminating. Three weeks later another episode of EAT was noted in this patient. In the remaining 17 cases, ablation was associated with acute success and no recurrences of sustained tachycardia in all patients. Mean duration time was 192 +/- 53.3 min (right atrium 161 +/- 37.9 min; left atrium 229.6 +/- 46.2 min), and average fluoroscopic time was 22.8 +/- 9.7 min (right atrium 17.1 +/- 6.2 min; left atrium 29.8 +/- 8.9 min). There was no incidence of serious complications associated with this procedure. In conclusions, electroanatomical mapping including cooled ablation was a safe and feasible strategy in treating EATs. The benefit of this technique may imply the combination of both precise localization of the focus and effective applications of radiofrequency pulses, thereby minimizing acute failures or reablation. Due to the time consuming point by point data acquisition, the ability to generate precise maps demonstrating the earliest activation at their exact anatomical location can be limited by transient or persistent termination of the tachycardia.",2004,Zeitschrift fur Kardiologie
The Coset Lattices of E. S. Barnes and G. E. Wall,"Abstract John Conway's analysis in 1968 of the automorphism group of the Leech lattice and his discoveryof three sporadic simple groups led to the immediate speculation that other Z-lattices mighthave interesting automorphism groups which give rise to (possibly new) finite simple groups.(The classification theorem for the finite simple groups has since told us that no new finitesimple groups can arise in this or any other way.) For example in 1973, M. Broue and M.Enguehard constructed, in every dimension 2"" , an even lattice (unimodular if n is odd) whoseautomorphism group is related to the simple Chevalley n grou . Thip osf famil type Dy ofintegral lattices received attention and acclaim in the subsequent literature. What escaped theattention of this literature, however, was the fact that these lattices had been discovered yearsearlier. Indeed in 1959, E. S. Barnes and G. E. Wall gave a uniform construction for a large classof positive definite Z-lattices in dimensions 2"" which include those of Broue and Enguehardas special cases. The present article introduces an abstracted and generalized version of theconstruction of Barnes and Wall. In addition, there are some new observations about Barnes-Wall lattices. In particular, it is shown how to associate to each such lattice a continuous,piecewise linear graph in the plane from which all the important properties of the lattice, forexample, its minimum, whether it is integral, unimodular, even, or perfect can be read offdirectly.1980 Mathematics subject classification {Amer.

Padua2,4 1Sapienza University, Board of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Rome, Italy; 2UniversitÃ  Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Institute of Neurology, Rome, Italy; 3Teikyo University, Institute of Neurology, Tokyo, Japan; 4Don Gnocchi ONLUS Foundation, Milan, Italy Question: Peroneal nerve palsy may occur after a close traumatic knee dislocation. Ultrasound shows its usefulness in traumatic nerve injures. Methods: We present 5 patients with a history of knee dislocation associated with peroneal nerve damage, evaluated by clinical, neurophysiologic and ultrasonographic (US) examination. All the patients were examined in follow-up. At the first evaluation, the patients presented a severe clinic and neurophysiologic damage of peroneal nerve. US showed an increase of the cross sectional area (CSA) of the involved peroneal nerve, between popliteal fossa and fibular head. Results: Among these, 4 subjects presented a CSA four-seven times larger than normal, while one subject had the damaged nerve CSA only double compared to the other side. The first 4 patients did not present improvement in clinical, neurophysiologic and ultrasonographic follow-up. The latter one showed a general improvement in the later evaluations. Conclusions: This observation let us consider that larger is the CSA of the involved peroneal nerve and worse is the prognosis for the patient. Associating neurophysiology to US evaluation, we can obtain a guide for diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation. In fact this combined evaluation gives data about the specific details and the changes over the time of the condition. This allow us to perform the best management for every individual case. P606 Ultrasonic evaluation as a method for determining diagnosis underlying clinical symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome N. Wolfram, U. van Deurs, M. Lauritzen Glostrup Hospital, Department of Clinical Neurophysiology, Glostrup, Denmark Background: High resolution ultrasound (HRUS) was used to differentiate carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) from other pathologies in the media nerve. Materials and methods: Forty-one patients, referred for diagnosis of CTS, were examined with HRUS supplemental to electrodiagnostic (EDX) evaluation when the medical history gave suspicion of polyneuropathy, cervical root affection on MRI scans, trauma or EDX changes not typical for CTS. Results: Twelve patients showed CTS in both EDX (29%) and HRUS, two patients had a bifid median nerve, one was supplemental investigated for HNPP. Seventeen patients had normal EDX (42%). Eight had normal findings by HRUS, five had CTS in HRUS, whereas four patients showed other pathologies including neurovascular contacts, bifid median nerve, partial nerve compression under the flexor retinaculum, palmaris muscle contacts and arthritis. Twelve patients showed atypical changes in EDX (29%). In this group, eight patients showed CTS in HRUS, four patients showed other pathologies including fibrolipomatous harmatoma, intraneural venous congestion, partial traumatic neuroma and flexor muscle compression under the flexor retinaculum. Conclusion: HRUS is not only relevant in confirming the diagnosis of CTS but also to reveal other clinical relevant pathologies when electrodiagnostic evaluation is normal or atypical. P607 Intraneural collateral circulation in the median nerve after radiocephalic fistula N. Wolfram, U. van Deurs, M. Lauritzen Glostrup Hospital, Clinical Neurophysiology, Glostrup, Denmark Introduction: Carpaltunnel Syndrome (CTS) is a known complication to chronic renal failure and radiocephalic fistula for hemodialysis, but the cause of median nerve affection is unknown. Case report: A 61 year old male with chronic renal failure, hemodialysis and radiocephalic fistula in the left forearm was referred for CTS, because of pain in the left thumb, progressive in flexion of the wrist and parestesia in finger 1 + 2. Electrodiagnostic (EDX) evaluation showed normal distal motor latency and motor velocity in the forearm, but reduced motor amplitude from the elbow. Normal sensory velocity from finger 2 and palm to wrist, with reduced sensory amplitudes. High resolution ultrasound (HRUS) (Esaote MyLAb Twice, 6-18 MHz) revealed intraneural arterial blood flow, presumably located in the intraneural venous plexus of the left median nerve at the level of the radiocephalic fistula, as well as hypo-eccogenic changes in the nerve fascicles. Discussion: Clinically, CTS may be mimicked by proximal nerve damage followed by intraneural collateral circulation in patients with radiocephalic fistula. This condition can easily and non-invasively be visualized using HRUS of the median nerve. P608 Ultrasound as a novel instrument for tremor evaluation and intervention S. Kim1, S. Ahn2, J.-H. Shin2 1Hanyang University, Seoul, Republic of Korea; 2National Rehabilitation Center, Rehabilitation, Seoul, Republic of Korea Question: Tremor is a common movement disorder, as which a varied neurological disorders can be presented and pharmacological treatment was firstly tried. Botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A) has been adopted as another treatment method, and recently ultrasonography-guided injection has been emphasized for accuracy. We hypothesized ultrasonography could takes another role as an objective indicator for tremor. Methods: We report two case studies in which tremor were the chief complaint. Case 1. A 29-year-old male patient with a postural and rest tremor of right hand consistent with Holmes tremor secondary to left pontine hemorrhage visited. His tremor gradually spread to wrist and elbow with the characteristics of 1.4-2 Hz, irregular flexion-extension oscillation being present at rest. Ultrasonography-guided BoNT-A injections were administered at extensor pollicis longus (40 U) muscles, and flexor digitorum superficialis 2nd, 3rd and 4th digits (20 U, each), which showed plainest contraction in real time ultrasonography. Ultrasonography revealed the frequency of tremor decreased from 1.4-2 Hz (baseline) to 0-0.5 Hz (2 weeks after injection), as calculated by each muscle contraction. Case 2. A 30-year-old female patient with bilateral tremor secondary to hypoxic brain damage visited. Her muscle contraction was 0.2-0.4 Hz at her left extensor carpi radialis, extensor policis longus, flexor carpi ulnaris muscles with the help of ultrasonography. BoNT-A injections were administered at extensor carpi radialis (20 U), extensor policis longus (15 U), and flexor carpi ulnaris (20 U) muscles with ultrasonography. The frequency of muscle contraction decreased to 0.1-0.2 Hz at 2 weeks after injection. Conclusion: Ultrasonography has an advantage of objective evaluation of tremor as well as selecting the target muscles. We regard ultrasonography as a novel tool in increasing the accuracy of evaluation and intervention.

Koenig2 1Klinikum Augsburg, Neurology, Augsburg, Germany; 2University Ulm, Neurosurgery, Guenzburg, Germany Introduction: Surgical treatment of nerve lesion in continuity remains difficult even in the most experienced hands. Their regenerative potential is evaluated either by intraoperative electrophysiology and/or intraneural dissection. The values of preoperative ultrasound is often hampered due to low tissue penetration and trauma related artifacts. Therefore the present study for the first time examines feasibility and value of intraoperative high-frequency ultrasound as an imaging tool in the management of traumatic nerve lesions in continuity. Material and methods: After development of intraoperative application of high-frequency ultrasound we examined 19 traumatic or iatrogenic nerve lesions of different extent. The information obtained was correlated to intraoperative electrophysiology, the findings of microsurgical intraneural dissection and histopathology of the resected nerve segments. Results: The intraoperative application of high-frequency ultrasound enabled morphological ultrastructural examination of traumatic nerve lesions with excellent imaging quality. The assessment of the severity of the",2014,Clinical Neurophysiology
Extended Lagrangian formulation of time-reversible Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics for higher-,"A Lagrangian generalization of time-reversible Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics [Niklasson et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. vol. 97, 123001 (2006)] is proposed. The Lagrangian includes extended electronic degrees of freedom as auxiliary dynamical variables in addition to the nuclear coordinates and momenta. While the nuclear degrees of freedom propagate on the Born-Oppenheimer potential energy surface, the extended auxiliary electronic degrees of freedom evolve as a harmonic oscillator centered around the adiabatic propagation of the self-consistent ground state. The formulation enables the application of higher-order symplectic or geometric integration schemes that are stable and energy conserving even under incomplete self-consistency convergence. It is demonstrated how the extended Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics improves the accuracy by over an order of magnitude compared to previous formulations at the same level of computational cost.",2007,
A spatial variable selection method for monitoring product surface,"Two-dimensional (2-D) data maps are generated in certain advanced manufacturing processes. Such maps contain rich information about process variation and product quality status. As a proven effective quality control technique, statistical process control (SPC) has been widely used in different processes for shift detection and assignable cause identification. However, charting algorithms for 2-D data maps are still vacant. This paper proposes a variable selection-based SPC method for monitoring 2-D wafer surface. The fused LASSO algorithm is firstly employed to identify potentially shifted sites on the surface; a charting statistic is then developed to detect statistically significant shifts. As the variable selection algorithm can nicely preserve shift patterns in spatial clusters, the newly proposed chart is proved to be both effective in detecting shifts and capable of providing diagnostic information for process improvement. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations and a real example have been used to demonstrate the effectiveness and usage of the proposed method.",2016,International Journal of Production Research

Familywise Error Rate Control With a Lasso Estimator,"We propose a new method to control the familywise error rate (FWER) in linear Gaussian models. Our 
method relies on a lasso-type estimator and can be used for all n x p full-rank design matrices. We provide 
an explicit and non-asymptotic choice for the lasso tuning parameter that controls the FWER. Numerical 
experiments highlight the performances of our approach compared to the state-of-the-art procedures. An 
application to the detection of metabolites in metabolomics is provided..",2017,
"Genome mining for lasso peptides: past, present, and future","Over the course of roughly a decade, the lasso peptide field has been transformed. Whereas new compounds were discovered infrequently via activity-driven approaches, now, the vast majority of lasso peptide discovery is driven by genome-mining approaches. This paper starts with a historical overview of the first genome-mining approaches for lasso peptide discovery, and then covers new tools that have emerged. Several examples of novel lasso peptides that have been discovered via genome mining are presented as are examples of new enzymes found associated with lasso peptide gene clusters. Finally, this paper concludes with future directions and unsolved challenges in lasso peptide genome mining.",2019,Journal of Industrial Microbiology & Biotechnology
Adaptive LASSO for measurement error models,"This paper focuses on variable selection and parameter estimation for measurement error models via adaptive LASSO method. Firstly, the adaptive LASSO estimator for linear models and partially linear models are proposed when the covariates are measured with error. Under some regular conditions the asymptotic properties of the estimators are investigated, it is proved that the adaptive lasso estimator has the oracle properties with proper choices of tuning parameter. Moreover, the algorithms and choices of penalty parameter and bandwidth are discussed. Finally, a Monte Carlo simulation study and a real data analysis are conducted to assess the finite sample performance of the proposed variable selection procedure. The results show that the adaptive LASSO estimator behaves well.",2014,
"Nursery area characteristics of Pleuronectids in coastal Alaska, USA","Juveniles of four species of pleuronectid flatfishes were abundant in bays and nearshore areas around Kodiak Island, Alaska during August 1991. Flatfish nursery areas located in deep water bays such as those surrounding Kodiak Island have not been previously reported. Age-0 rock sole (Pleuronectes bilineatus), flathead sole (Hippoglossoides elassodon), Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis) and age-1 yellowfin sole (Pleuronectes asper) were collected close to one another and at first appeared to share nursery areas. Closer examination of associated within-bay distribution, depth, substrate, temperature and salinity data revealed characteristics which limited nursery area overlap. The major concentrations of juveniles of these species could usually be segregated by one or more of the physical parameters investigated. Based on the physical characteristics found to be most important in determining distribution of juveniles for each species, we hypothesize the following relationships. Age-0 rock sole are found predominantly in water depths less than 50 m, on sand or mixed sand substrate outside of or within bays. Age-0 flathead sole are found predominantly in water depths greater than 40 m, on mud or mixed mud substrate throughout bays. Age-0 Pacific halibut are found predominantly in water depths less than 40 m, on mixed sand substrate near or outside mouths of bays. Age-1 yellowfin sole are found predominantly in water depths less than 40 m, on mixed substrates at upper reaches of bays. These hypotheses will be field tested, after which the relationships may be considered for application to broader geographic areas.",1995,Netherlands Journal of Sea Research
