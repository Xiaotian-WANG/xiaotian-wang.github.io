Development and validation of a 10â€gene prognostic signature for acute myeloid leukaemia,"Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is the most common type of adult acute leukaemia and has a poor prognosis. Thus, optimal risk stratification is of greatest importance for reasonable choice of treatment and prognostic evaluation. For our study, a total of 1707 samples of AML patients from three public databases were divided into meta-training, meta-testing and validation sets. The meta-training set was used to build risk prediction model, and the other four data sets were employed for validation. By log-rank test and univariate COX regression analysis as well as LASSO-COX, AML patients were divided into high-risk and low-risk groups based on AML risk score (AMLRS) which was constituted by 10 survival-related genes. In meta-training, meta-testing and validation sets, the patient in the low-risk group all had a significantly longer OS (overall survival) than those in the high-risk group (PÂ <Â .001), and the area under ROC curve (AUC) by time-dependent ROC was 0.5854-0.7905 for 1Â year, 0.6652-0.8066 for 3Â years and 0.6622-0.8034 for 5Â years. Multivariate COX regression analysis indicated that AMLRS was an independent prognostic factor in four data sets. Nomogram combining the AMLRS and two clinical parameters performed well in predicting 1-year, 3-year and 5-year OS. Finally, we created a web-based prognostic model to predict the prognosis of AML patients (https://tcgi.shinyapps.io/amlrs_nomogram/).",2020,Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine
From shipwreck to constellation: Rethinking Meillassoux on MallarmÃ© from a semiotic perspective,"Abstract This essay assesses Quentin Meillassouxâ€™s numerological approach to MallarmÃ©â€™s problematic but formally innovative poem â€œUn Coup de dÃ©s,â€ using a semiotic methodology to reveal the deficiencies of that approach from the viewpoint of literary theory. Section 1 describes my expanded version of Michael Riffaterreâ€™s semiotic theory of the structure of modern poetry. Poems are generated by two underlying propositions, each of which governs the structure of a set of symbolic images on the textual surface. These â€œmatricialâ€ propositions are linked by a syntagmatic relation. The primary text functions as subject-sign of the Peircean semiotic triad; its object-sign is an intertextual model. The interpretant of these two textual signs is assembled by the reader and has a sociolectic counterpart â€“ or context â€“ which has similar lexical content but contrasting internal structure. This contrast may produce a change in the preconceptions of the reader. Section 2 examines Meillassouxâ€™s approach to MallarmÃ©â€™s poem, which is preoccupied with a â€œnumberâ€ supposedly encrypted in the text. This is not convincingly related to the propositional structure of the poem. In Section 3, the text is interpreted using a semiotics-based methodology. The poem is generated by two matrices: one concerning the â€œMasterâ€ versus the storm, and the second concerning the power of Chance. The relation linking the matrices is clarified. This analysis is compared with that of Meillassoux throughout. Section 4 resumes the differences between Meillassouxâ€™s concentration on the â€œnumberâ€ and the â€œsiren,â€ and my analysis which centres on the relation between the Master (symbolising traditional poets and their preferred metre) and the Constellation (symbolising the wide range of new future poetic metres and formats). Meillassouxâ€™s approach turns out to be unconvincing.",2019,Semiotica
On the accuracy of alternative approaches for calibrating bank stress test models,"Multi-year forecasts of bank performance under stressful economic conditions determine large institution regulatory capital requirements and yet the accuracy of these forecasts is undocumented. I compare the accuracies of alternative stress test model forecasts using the financial crisis as the stress scenario. Models include specifications that mimic the Federal Reserve CLASS model and alternatives that use Lasso, the AIC and an abridged set of explanatory variables. A simple single-equation Lasso model has, by far, the best forecast accuracy. Large differences in model forecast accuracy are undetectable from estimation sample statistics. These findings highlight the need for new methods for validating bank stress test models.",2018,Journal of Financial Stability

Medium Effects and Nuclear Transport Theory,"It is commonly believed nowadays that an acceptable nuclear transport theory for heavy ion collisions in a very broad energy range (from a few MeV/u to several GeV/u) should include a correct description of : (1) mean field effects ; (2) two-body collisions ; (3) particle production. A complete theory embodying these features does not exist yet. However, considerable progress has been made in the recent years. On the theoretical side, it was recognized that the Landau-Vlassov equation phenomenologically introduced by Landau for Fermi fluids, had many attributes of a good nuclear theory (for a review, see Ref. 1), despite the fact that it appears as a truncation2 of the BBGKY hierarchy of the density matrices3, which is the exact theory in anonrelativistic approach with potential forces. On the practical side, a variety of models (BUU, VUU, QMD, quasi-particle methods,â€¦) aiming at the solution of the Landau-Vlassov equation, give more and more satisfactory descriptions of the experimental data (for a review, see Ref. 4). The appealing feature of the Landau-Vlassov theory is the presence in the mean field term of physical quantities directly related to the equation of state. Therefore it is a priori a suitable tool to investigate the nuclear matter equation of state at several times normal nuclear matter density.",1989,
The seagrass and associated macroalgal vegetation of Gazi Bay (Kenya),"The seagrass and macroalgal vegetation of Gazi Bay (at approximately 50 km south of Mombasa) have been studied by means of 88 relevÃ©s along 7 transects. Correlation between the distribution of the seagrasses and some abiotic factors (particle size fractions, chemical composition of the substrate) is not well marked. Nevertheless a general zonation and succession of seagrasses could be established:1.A transition zone between the mangal and the seagrass beds is covered byBoodleopsis pusilla;2.the pioneer associationHalophila ovalis +Halodule wrightii forms low sandy bumps at the upper limit of the seagrass beds, but also occurs in the whole midlittoral where sandlayers have recently been accumulated (e.g. on coral platforms);3.the climax vegetation of the intertidal zone seems to beThalassia hemprichii which sometimes is associated withCymodocea rotundata andC. serrulata, certainly in deeper pools and close to low water mark;Halimeda opuntia,Gracilaria salicornia andG. corticata are also frequent in this vegetation type;4.from low water at neap tide downwards patches of monospecificEnhalus acoroides vegetation can also occur;5.from mean low water down to approximately âˆ’1 m mixed meadows ofThalassia, C. serrulata, C rotundata andHalodule uninervis are well developed; the seaweedsHalimeda macrooloba andAvrainvillea obscura are also typical for this zone; locally patches ofSyringodium isoetifolium grow on small bumps andHalophila stipulacea grows as a pioneer on bare sand;6.from âˆ’1 m downwards the whole lagoon is covered by homogeneous, monospecificThalassodendron ciliatum meadows, locally replaced byE. acoroides.",2004,Hydrobiologia
Resampling-based tests for Lasso in genome-wide association studies,"BackgroundGenome-wide association studies involve detecting association between millions of genetic variants and a trait, which typically use univariate regression to test association between each single variant and the phenotype. Alternatively, Lasso penalized regression allows one to jointly model the relationship between all genetic variants and the phenotype. However, it is unclear how to best conduct inference on the individual Lasso coefficients, especially in high-dimensional settings.MethodsWe consider six methods for testing the Lasso coefficients: two permutation (Lasso-Ayers, Lasso-PL) and one analytic approach (Lasso-AL) to select the penalty parameter for type-1-error control, residual bootstrap (Lasso-RB), modified residual bootstrap (Lasso-MRB), and a permutation test (Lasso-PT). Methods are compared via simulations and application to the Minnesota Center for Twins and Family Study.ResultsWe show that for finite sample sizes with increasing number of null predictors, Lasso-RB, Lasso-MRB, and Lasso-PT fail to be viable methods of inference. However, Lasso-PL and Lasso-AL remain fast and powerful tools for conducting inference with the Lasso, even in high-dimensions.ConclusionOur results suggest that the proposed permutation selection procedure (Lasso-PL) and the analytic selection method (Lasso-AL) are fast and powerful alternatives to the standard univariate analysis in genome-wide association studies.",2017,BMC Genetics
"How many species of the aquatic sloth Thalassocnus (Xenarthra: Megatheriidae) were in Chile?: new evidences from the BahÃ­a Inglesa Formation, with a reappraisal of their biochronological affinities","The aquatic sloth, Thalassocnus, is one of the most intriguing lineage of mammal known from the southern pacific coast of South America during the late Neogene. It was initially recognized in Peru, but recent paleontological surveys also recorded its presence in Chile. However, the determination of how many species of Thalassocnus were actually present in Chile remains as an open question. Here, we provide a detailed morphological description of an isolated distal fragment of humerus recovered at the Mina Fosforita member (ca. 7 Ma), Bahia Inglesa Formation (Atacama Region, northern Chile), which is referred to Thalassocnus. Morphological comparisons with others forms from Chile and Peru allow us to attribute the CPUC/C/557 specimen to Thalassocnus cf. T. natans, though some degree of intraspecific variation is acknowledged. The assessment of the stratigraphic provenance of the materials with previously assigned to Thalassocnus from the Bahia Inglesa, Horcon and Coquimbo formations, permits us to propose that the taxonomic diversity of Thalassocnus in Chile is unequivocal conformed by T. carolomartini, and T. natans. We also admitted the likely presence of T. antiquus and probably T. yaucensis. Futures discoveries of more complete specimens, and/or the detailed analysis of undescribed specimens from Chile will undoubtedly contribute to illustrate the evolutionary history of the Thalassocnus radiation in Chile.",2019,Andean Geology
Intrinsic reconstruction in a tetraplegic grip/extension model--the challenge of extrapolating from the cadaver to the patient.,"There is inadequate evidence-based practice in tetraplegic hand reconstruction because of limited subject numbers and heterogeneity between patients. These limitations increase the potential value of models to better understand the functioning of the tetraplegic hand. The cadaveric model illustrated in the article under discussion provides information regarding the impact of intrinsic loading or absence on simulated grip functioning and the impact of two different reconstructions to reduce the deformity observed in intrinsic minus hands. Although the described model provides valuable information regarding the potential impact of â€œintrinsic reconstructionâ€ in the tetraplegic patient population, the limitation of themodel precludes direct comparison to the clinical situation. One critical limitation is the lack of wrist motion in the model. Tenodesis provides rudimentary grip for most mid-level tetraplegic patients and is an essential component in the functioning of the static Zancolli-lasso procedure for these patients. The authors have attempted to address this consideration by using a 40 fixed metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint position to mimic the position of the MCP joint when the wrist is in functional position. This may be a reasonable compromise given the limitations of the model, but it fails to reflect the potential MCP motion experienced by patients with tetraplegia using wrist motion relatedetenodesis. A more important consideration is the method the authors used to determine the force and excursion for their model. The authors thoughtfully selected experimental variables to maximize the value of the data from this model. Specifically, the values selected were based on what works for the model, not what is available clinically. Unfortunately, it is unclear if these findings can be reasonably generalized to reflect the anticipated clinical results of patients with tetraplegia. For example,",2015,The Journal of hand surgery
Sub-regional pattern analysis of heterogeneous PET tracer distribution employed for disease assessment,"The mean value of the non-displaceable binding potential (BPND) within a region of interest (ROI) is the traditionally-employed metric in neurological image analysis. The ability of the mean value to accurately track clinical disease progression may be limited since it does not capture the spatial pattern of tracer distribution. In this work, we employ the principal component analysis (PCA) to quantify the clinically-relevant tracer binding patterns ([11C]dihydrotetrabenazine) in high-resolution PET images of 37 Parkinson's disease subjects. The principal component (PC) scores that correspond to different binding patterns in the putamen ROIs are combined with the mean BPND and used as the input to several linear models that aim to predict the clinical severity of the disease (disease duration). Multiple regression analysis and LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) with cross-validation are used to evaluate the contributions of the PC scores to the accuracy of the tested models. With multiple regression analysis, the value of the adjusted R2 was 0.57 when the mean BPND alone was used as the model input. When the PC scores were included as additional input variables, the value of the adjusted R2 increased to 0.70. The terms of the model representing the PC scores were statistically significant (p<0.01). In LASSO analysis, the cross-validated accuracy improved by 25% when the PC scores were added to the input (compared to using the mean BPND alone). These results demonstrate that a) the disease- and tracer-specific binding patterns can be identified in sub-cortical brain structures from high-resolution PET images, and b) such patterns may facilitate better models of the clinical disease metrics.",2016,"2016 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium, Medical Imaging Conference and Room-Temperature Semiconductor Detector Workshop (NSS/MIC/RTSD)"
Is hemodiafiltration medically superior to hemodialysis?,"Over the past few years, data generated by pro-spective randomized trials (RCT) have becomeavailable on the subject mentioned in the title ofthis contribution. The rationale for these trials camefrom observational studies and small clinical trialssuggesting that on-line hemodiaï¬ltration (olHDF)offers a better renal replacement treatment thanstandard hemodialysis (HD) (1). The mechanisticrationale to this superiority of olHDF is the possi-ble relevance of enhanced clearance of larger molec-ular weight uremic toxins as a result of combiningdiffusion and convective transport (1).The ï¬rst study was a RCT in which patients wererandomized to a hemoï¬ltration-based therapy orstandard HD. Better hemodynamic stability wasreported in patients randomized to hemoï¬ltration(2). Three subsequent studies addressed the hypoth-esis that olHDF is associated with a superior clini-cal outcome assessed as overall mortality inaddition to improvement in other major clinicalevents (3â€“5). All three had a more or less similardesign: patients were randomized to either continua-tion of HD or switched to olHDF. Both groupswere â€œdialyzedâ€ for 4 hours thrice weekly.In the ï¬rst two studies, there was no difference inthe primary endpoint of survival (3,4), while in thethird study, survival was improved in patients ran-domized to the olHDF arm: 30% lower risk of all-cause mortality, 33% lower risk of cardiovascularmortality, and 55% lower risk of infection-relatedmortality (5). However, when secondary analyseswere carried out in the ï¬rst two studies looking atdose and survival, it was concluded that whenachieving what appeared to be a threshold hemoï¬l-tration dose component of 22â€“23 liters/treatment,olHDF now also demonstrated improved survivalcompared with HD (3â€“6). This dose:survivalresponse relationship was similarly found in thethird study and thus appears to be a robust ï¬nding.This improved survival effect of olHDF remainedpresent after extensive correction for possible con-founders. These data make it hard to not concludethat olHDF is the superior therapy (6).In each of these studies, there were variablehemoï¬ltration volumes delivered and some haveposited that healthier patients, because of theirhealthier status, received larger hemoï¬ltrationvolumes, implying that the improved survivalassociated with higher hemoï¬ltration volumes wasbiased. To further elucidate this, the CONTRASTgroup carried out an analysis some years ago, andreported that treatment time and blood ï¬‚ow ratethrough the extracorporeal circuit are the mostimportant, potentially modiï¬able, factors that deter-mined hemoï¬ltration volume, not a patientâ€™s generalhealth (7). Using these data, the CONTRASTgroup argued that it should be possible to actuallyachieve these â€œhigherâ€ levels of convection volumein most patients in everyday clinical practice (8),and that treatment policy rather than patientcharacteristics determines convection volume inolHDF (9).Before deï¬nitely endorsing olHDF as a preferredtherapy, the question of downsides to olHDF mustbe considered. An often-heard concern is that ofsafety. Given the fact that large amounts of on-lineprepared ï¬‚uids are infused directly into patients, thequality of the ï¬‚uid must meet the highest standardswith respect to both chemical and microbiologicalvariables. These issues are discussed in great detailelsewhere (10). Earlier, the CONTRAST groupaddressed an aspect of the safety by measuringmicrobiological quality of the dialysate/infusate in alarge sample size (11). The overall conclusion wasthat it is indeed possible to obtain adequate qualityover a prolonged period of time. In yet anotherreport, the CONTRAST group assessed CRP andinterleukin-6 levels over time in a subset of thestudy (12). In both the olHDF and the HD groups,levels of these variables increased slightly over time,but the rate of increase was less pronounced in theHDF group compared with the HD group.Thus, there was no indication that the infusion oflarge amounts of ï¬‚uid into the patients of the HDFgroup induced an inï¬‚ammatory state. If anything, itwas the contrary. There is also the logical concernthat valuable larger molecular substances are beingremoved by HDF. In the CONTRAST trial, albu-min was measured over time and no differences",2014,Seminars in dialysis

Using longitudinal metamorphosis to examine ischemic stroke lesion dynamics on perfusion-weighted and relation to final outcome on T2-w images,"We extend the image-to-image metamorphosis into constrained longitudinal metamorphosis. We apply it to estimate an evolution scenario, in patients with acute ischemic stroke, of both scattered and solitary ischemic lesions visible on serial MR perfusion weighted imaging from acute to subacute stages. We then estimate a patient-specific residual map that enables us to capture the most relevant shape and intensity changes, continuously, as the lesion evolves from acute through subacute to chronic timepoints until merging into the final image. We detect areas with high residuals (ie. high dynamics) and identify areas that became part of the final T2-w lesion obtained at â‰¥ 1 month after stroke. This allows the investigation of the dynamic influence of perfusion values on the final lesion outcome as seen on T2-w imaging. The model provides detailed insights into stroke lesion dynamic evolution in space and time that will help identify factors that determine final outcome and identify targets for interventions to improve outcome.

Linear and nonlinear variable selection in competing risks data.,Subdistribution hazard model for competing risks data has been applied extensively in clinical researches. Variable selection methods of linear effects for competing risks data have been studied in the past decade. There is no existing work on selection of potential nonlinear effects for subdistribution hazard model. We propose a two-stage procedure to select the linear and nonlinear covariate(s) simultaneously and estimate the selected covariate effect(s). We use spectral decomposition approach to distinguish the linear and nonlinear parts of each covariate and adaptive LASSO to select each of the 2 components. Extensive numerical studies are conducted to demonstrate that the proposed procedure can achieve good selection accuracy in the first stage and small estimation biases in the second stage. The proposed method is applied to analyze a cardiovascular disease data set with competing death causes.,2018,Statistics in medicine
Incorporating gene annotation information into fine-mapping quantitative trait loci in genome-wide association studies: a hier- archical generalized l inear model approach,"Genomic evaluation models estimated by e.g. GBLUP and Bayesian methods are used in genome-wide association (GWA) studies for taking all the genetic markers into account. Other shrinkage methods like LASSO are also applied to select massive variables in GWA. However, these methods do shrinkage only from genotypic information. They cannot solve problems like effectively fine-mapping causal genes in a complex associated region since plenty of known gene annotation information is not used. This paper introduces a HGLM approach for fine-mapping QTL, incorporating annotation information into structured random effect dispersion. Using a real GWA dataset, we tested five candidate genes with their corresponding phenotypes. P-values of the likelihood ratio test for these genes varied with the lengths of the surrounded SNP regions, and simulations showed that the test has a reliable false positive rate. We showed that the proposed method is capable of fine-mapping highly significant signals. âˆ—Email: v10yumxi@du.se",2011,
"Wert, Giaches de","Ebenso wie z. B. Lasso und wahrscheinlich auch de Rore kam auch G. de W. schon in seiner Kindheit nach Italien. Niederlandische Sangerknaben waren in Italien auserordentlich gesucht und wurden regelrecht importiert. Abgesehen vom fruhen Unterricht als Chorknabe erhielt de W. seine Ausbildung also in Italien. Allerdings spricht einiges dafur, das de W., als er wegen des Stimmbruchs aus dem Dienst in der Kapelle der Marchesa Maria di Cardona ausscheiden muste, 1550 nach Ferrara zog, um bis 1553 bei de Rore in die Lehre zu gehen. 1561 bis 1563 arbeiteten de W. und Rore in Parma eng zusammen: de W. als Mitglied, de Rore als Leiter der Sangerkapelle Ottavio Farneses. W. stunde somit uber Rore und dessen Lehrer Willaert doch noch in der niederlandischen Komponistentradition; es darf daruber jedoch keineswegs vergessen werden, das der Kompositionsstil der Italo-Flamen mittlerweile deutlich von der Setzweise der nordlich der Alpen verbliebenen Verwandten abwich und in der Auseinandersetzung mit der Musik und den soziokulturellen Gegebenheiten Italiens eine eigene charakteristische Auspragung erfahren hatte. De W.s fruher Madrigalstil bis etwa zur Mitte der sechziger Jahre ist noch stark von de Rore und dem spaten Willaert beeinflust: Die Stucke sind gekennzeichnet durch z.T. abrupte Tonartenwechsel, ausgepragt dissonierende Zusammenklange und â€” in Verbindung damit â€” ungewohnliche Stimmfuhrungen und Intervallfortschreitungen. Wie schon de Rore benutzt auch W. diese Mittel ausschlieslich zur Textdarstellung. War de W.s Textwahl bis zur Mitte der siebziger Jahre noch stark durch den Petrarkismus (â†’Arcadelt) sowie die Werke Luigi Tansillos und Ludovico Ariostos gepragt, so erlangen in der Folge die Vertonungen von Gedichten Torquato Tassos und nicht zuletzt Giambattista Guarinis ein gewisses Ubergewicht.",1992,
Online Learning for Group Lasso,"We develop a novel online learning algorithm for the group lasso in order to efficiently find the important explanatory factors in a grouped manner. Different from traditional batch-mode group lasso algorithms, which suffer from the inefficiency and poor scalability, our proposed algorithm performs in an online mode and scales well: at each iteration one can update the weight vector according to a closed-form solution based on the average of previous subgradients. Therefore, the proposed online algorithm can be very efficient and scalable. This is guaranteed by its low worst-case time complexity and memory cost both in the order of O(d), where d is the number of dimensions. Moreover, in order to achieve more sparsity in both the group level and the individual feature level, we successively extend our online system to efficiently solve a number of variants of sparse group lasso models. We also show that the online system is applicable to other group lasso models, such as the group lasso with overlap and graph lasso. Finally, we demonstrate the merits of our algorithm by experimenting with both synthetic and real-world datasets.",2010,
The spikeâ€andâ€slab lasso Cox model for survival prediction and associated genes detection,"Motivation: Largeâ€scale molecular profiling data have offered extraordinary opportunities to improve survival prediction of cancers and other diseases and to detect disease associated genes. However, there are considerable challenges in analyzing largeâ€scale molecular data. Results: We propose new Bayesian hierarchical Cox proportional hazards models, called the spikeâ€andâ€slab lasso Cox, for predicting survival outcomes and detecting associated genes. We also develop an efficient algorithm to fit the proposed models by incorporating Expectationâ€Maximization steps into the extremely fast cyclic coordinate descent algorithm. The performance of the proposed method is assessed via extensive simulations and compared with the lasso Cox regression. We demonstrate the proposed procedure on two cancer datasets with censored survival outcomes and thousands of molecular features. Our analyses suggest that the proposed procedure can generate powerful prognostic models for predicting cancer survival and can detect associated genes.

Syddansk Universitet De novo pathway-based biomarker identification,"Gene expression profiles have been extensively discussed as an aid to guide the therapy by predicting disease outcome for the patients suffering from complex diseases, such as cancer. However, prediction models built upon single-gene (SG) features show poor stability and performance on independent datasets. Attempts to mitigate these drawbacks have led to the development of network-based approaches that integrate pathway information to produce meta-gene (MG) features. Also, MG approaches have only dealt with the two-class problem of good versus poor outcome prediction. Stratifying patients based on their molecular subtypes can provide a detailed view of the disease and lead to more personalized therapies. We propose and discuss a novel MG approach based on de novo pathways, which for the first time have been used as features in a multi-class setting to predict cancer subtypes. Comprehensive evaluation in a large cohort of breast cancer samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed that MGs are considerably more stable than SG models, while also providing valuable insight into the cancer hallmarks that drive them. In addition, when tested on an independent benchmark non-TCGA dataset, MG features consistently outperformed SG models. We provide an easy-touse web service at http://pathclass.compbio.sdu.dk where users can upload their own gene expression datasets from breast cancer studies and obtain the subtype predictions from all the classifiers. INTRODUCTION High-throughput gene expression profiling from DNA microarrays in combination with machine learning techniques is a widespread approach to identify genes that can be used to stratify patients into groups with distinct clinical outcome. These so-called gene expression panels (GEPs) can then be used to guide clinicians in selecting the appropriate therapy in complex diseases, for example, lupus (1), Chronâ€™s disease (2) or Parkinsonâ€™s (3). Commercialized GEPs have already been developed for outcome prediction in cancer: MammaprintÂ® (4), a set of 70 genes for lowor high-risk prediction in breast cancer, DecipherÂ® (5), a panel of 22 RNA markers to predict risk of metastases in prostate cancer and OncoType DXÂ® panels for tumor profiling in breast (6), prostate (7) and colon (8) cancer. Although GEPs have shown relative success in cancer prognosis, it was demonstrated that their predictive performance is not consistent across datasets (9). An insufficient number of samples, inherent noise in the experiments and the heterogeneity of cancer patients have been pointed out as main reasons for the lack of feature stability and prediction accuracy. Moreover, cross validation shows that even on a single dataset, the size and composition of the selected gene panels varies strongly (10). The large number of features, which are often correlated, pose a significant challenge in cancer subtyping when only comparably few samples are available (p n problem). Complex diseases such as cancer have thus driven the need for more â€˜systemsâ€™-based approaches that elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the disorder rather than the effect of individual genes. Hence, recent efforts to predict outcome in cancer exploit the wealth of information about proteinâ€“protein interactions, gene regulations, *To whom correspondence should be addressed.

In the context of patient outcome prediction, a popular approach is to aggregate groups of biologically related genes into gene sets with a summary activity score, often called meta-genes (11) (MGs). They are hence also called â€˜composite-featuresâ€™ (12), which are used in supervised learning methods in the expectation that they will provide improved prediction performance and higher feature stability compared with singlegene (SG) panels (i.e. sets of genes treated as a priori unrelated and independent). MGs can also be used to group highly correlated genes and reduce the overall feature number, thus alleviating the p n problem. In addition, MGs representing pathways can provide a higher level of interpretation and help biomedical researchers to identify novel biomarkers and drug targets. To obtain a set of predictive MGs in cancer, some approaches (13,14) use predefined pathways or gene sets expertly curated and stored in public databases (e.g. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) (15), Reactome (16)). However, most a priori defined pathways are not disease-specific and are thus only partially affected during the course of the disease in question. Despite continuous improvement over the years, interaction databases are still biased toward well-understood biological processes and few pathways are compiled and annotated for rare or specific (sub-)types of diseases (17). Other methods (18,19) extract a new list of case-specific pathways by searching for connected subnetworks in a large interaction network. The top ranking subnetworks are then selected and used as MG features for the classification procedure. We previously termed this pathway extraction step as de novo pathway enrichment, (20), although other terms exist as well such as functional module detection or connected subnetwork extraction. Various de novo pathway enrichment methods have been proposed (e.g. (21â€“26)) differing in subnetwork scoring function, optimization criteria or search method. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, popular and well-established methods have never been used in the context of pathwaybased prediction. We believe this is due to limiting factors such as high runtime, low robustness (27), unintuitive parameters or lack of a publicly available software package or web service (23,28) that can be easily integrated into the classification pipeline. For these reasons, it is understandable that most MG classifiers extract subnetworks using simple but fast search heuristic methods (19,29) that may be prone to overlook relevant genes or interactions. Even though previous studies employing MG classifiers report an improvement over SG classifiers, other evaluations (30â€“33) have challenged such claims. In more rigorous and exhaustive simulations performed on larger datasets, Staiger et al. (32) demonstrated that MGs do not outperform SGs in prediction performance or stability over a range of different networks, gene sets or classifiers. In a more recent study (34), Allahyar et al. identified shortcomings that could lead to loss of predictive power of MG classifiers evaluated by Staiger et al. In particular, they argued that using simple averaging operators to produce a MG score can lead to loss of predictive power, while performing feature extraction and feature ranking for selection in separate steps can produce unstable features. Allahyar et al. show that by introducing certain improvements to the MG classifiers that mitigate these problems, their performance increases and in some cases achieve equal or better results than SG classifiers. Allahyar et al. further introduce FERAL, a method that produces multiple MGs from the same gene sets by using multiple aggregation operators. FERAL then implements a sparse group lasso approach that simultaneously selects the features and integrates them into the prediction model, thus avoiding the separate feature selection and ranking procedure. Although the authors report higher prediction accuracy with FERAL compared with other known MG classifiers as well as SGs, improvement over SGs is modest and it becomes evident that cancer outcome prediction based on gene expression might not have the potential to improve significantly regardless of the features, datasets or techniques used to build the classifiers (34). Cancers are often characterized by the occurrence of subtypes with distinct clinical outcome. One example is found in breast cancer, in which clinically relevant subtypes have been defined that show significant differences in terms of their incidence, risk factors, prognosis and treatment sensitivity (35). In clinical practice, breast cancer is classified based on the estrogen and progesterone receptor status, as well as the expression of the Her2 gene. Nevertheless, histopathological classification of the tumor samples is prone to human error given that it must be performed by a skilled pathologist (36). In an effort to more reliably assign subtypes to cancer patients, the PAM50 (37) GEP was developed, a set of 50 genes stratifying patients into five â€˜intrinsicâ€™ molecular subtypes: Basal, Her2, LumA, LumB and Normal-like. Although efforts have been made to obtain smaller gene sets based on gene expression (38), the PAM50 gene panel currently remains the quasi-gold standard for breast cancer subtype classification and has been used, for instance, by The Cancer Genome Atlas (18) (TCGA). In this article, we focus on a pathway-based prediction of cancer subtypes, as opposed to previous MG classifiers, which have only addressed the two class problem of good versus bad outcome prediction (based on time of death, recurrence or metastasis) in cancer patients. We propose a novel pipeline that extracts subtype-specific pathways su",2017,
A two-stage sparse logistic regression for optimal gene selection in high-dimensional microarray data classification,"The common issues of high-dimensional gene expression data are that many of the genes may not be relevant, and there exists a high correlation among genes. Gene selection has been proven to be an effective way to improve the results of many classification methods. Sparse logistic regression using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) or using smoothly clipped absolute deviation is one of the most widely applicable methods in cancer classification for gene selection. However, this method faces a critical challenge in practical applications when there are high correlations among genes. To address this problem, a two-stage sparse logistic regression is proposed, with the aim of obtaining an efficient subset of genes with high classification capabilities by combining the screening approach as a filter method and adaptive lasso with a new weight as an embedded method. In the first stage, sure independence screening method as a screening approach retains those genes representing high individual correlation with the cancer class level. In the second stage, the adaptive lasso with new weight is implemented to address the existence of high correlations among the screened genes in the first stage. Experimental results based on four publicly available gene expression datasets have shown that the proposed method significantly outperforms three state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification accuracy, G-mean, area under the curve, and stability. In addition, the results demonstrate that the top selected genes are biologically related to the cancer type. Thus, the proposed method can be useful for cancer classification using DNA gene expression data in real clinical practice.",2019,Advances in Data Analysis and Classification
Lasso-based index tracking and statistical arbitrage long-short strategies,"Abstract In this paper, we apply the lasso-type regression to solve the index tracking (IT) and the long-short investing strategies. In both cases, our objective is to exploit the mean-reverting properties of prices as reported in the literature. This method is an interesting technique for portfolio selection due to its capacity to perform variable selection in linear regression and to solve high-dimensional problems (which is the case if we consider broader indexes such as the SP and Ibovespa - Brazilian market), comprising data from 2010 to 2017. Also, we formed IT portfolios using cointegration (a method widely used for index tracking) to have a basis for comparison of the results using lasso. The findings for IT showed similar overall performance between portfolios using lasso and cointegration, with a slight advantage to cointegration in some cases. Nonetheless, lasso-based IT portfolios presented average monthly turnover at least 40% smaller, indicating that lasso generated portfolios that had not only a consistent tracking performance but also a considerable advantage in terms of transaction costs (represented by the average turnover).",2020,The North American Journal of Economics and Finance
Inferring velum movements from acoustic features,"Although acoustical methods have been widely used in the literature on nasality, a direct link between the acoustic features and velum movements during speech production is yet to be established. In this study, we propose a model through which the vertical movements of the velum are inferred from an acoustic feature set. An X-ray Microbeam data set collected at University of Tokyo is used for the modeling. The data recorded the vertical movements of the velum of 11 American English speakers saying both isolated words and sentences. Velum positions are traced by a metal pallet placed on top of the velum. 40 MFCC (Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficient) features are extracted from the accompanying acoustic signal at each time frame. MFCC features of five frames to both sides of the current frame, together with the current frame, consist of the 440-dimensional feature vector for predicting the velum position of the current frame. The feature vectors are then fitted to a lasso regression model. The inferred velum...",2016,Journal of the Acoustical Society of America

Regularized Spherical Polar Fourier Diffusion MRI with Optimal Dictionary Learning,"Compressed Sensing (CS) takes advantage of signal sparsity or compressibility and allows superb signal reconstruction from relatively few measurements. Based on CS theory, a suitable dictionary for sparse representation of the signal is required. In diffusion MRI (dMRI), CS methods proposed for reconstruction of diffusion-weighted signal and the Ensemble Average Propagator (EAP) utilize two kinds of Dictionary Learning (DL) methods: 1) Discrete Representation DL (DR-DL), and 2) Continuous Representation DL (CR-DL). DR-DL is susceptible to numerical inaccuracy owing to interpolation and regridding errors in a discretized q-space. In this paper, we propose a novel CR-DL approach, called Dictionary Learning - Spherical Polar Fourier Imaging (DL-SPFI) for effective compressed-sensing reconstruction of the q-space diffusion-weighted signal and the EAP. In DL-SPFI, a dictionary that sparsifies the signal is learned from the space of continuous Gaussian diffusion signals. The learned dictionary is then adaptively applied to different voxels using a weighted LASSO framework for robust signal reconstruction. Compared with the start-of-the-art CR-DL and DR-DL methods proposed by Merlet et al. and Bilgic et al., respectively, our work offers the following advantages. First, the learned dictionary is proved to be optimal for Gaussian diffusion signals. Second, to our knowledge, this is the first work to learn a voxel-adaptive dictionary. The importance of the adaptive dictionary in EAP reconstruction will be demonstrated theoretically and empirically. Third, optimization in DL-SPFI is only performed in a small subspace resided by the SPF coefficients, as opposed to the q-space approach utilized by Merlet et al. We experimentally evaluated DL-SPFI with respect to L1-norm regularized SPFI (L1-SPFI), which uses the original SPF basis, and the DR-DL method proposed by Bilgic et al. The experiment results on synthetic and real data indicate that the learned dictionary produces sparser coefficients than the original SPF basis and results in significantly lower reconstruction error than Bilgic et al.'s method.",2013,Medical image computing and computer-assisted intervention : MICCAI ...

[Prevalence of asthma in subjects aged 15-64 years in Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina Faso) in 1998].,"The purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence of asthma in the city of Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina Faso) and detail the epidemiological pattern. A screening questionnaire was administered to a representative sample of the city population: 808 subjects aged 15 to 64 years. Persons presenting signs suggestive of asthma were asked to attend consultations at the lung disease unit of the Souro-Sanou Hospital at Bobo-Dioulasso for physical examination. The prevalence of asthma was 9.6%. In the asthma population, 80.8% were aged 15-45 years, with no difference between men and women. Signs of asthma predominated during the evening and night (57.5%). Both benign and intermittent courses were observed. There was a peak during the cold dry season (44% of the acute episodes). Asthma was found in subjects from all ethnic origins but with different distributions. Asthma was found to be an important public health problem in Bobo-Dioulasso. Further studies should be conducted throughout the country to obtain more precise information on asthma and better detail the different aspects in order to develop prevention measures.",2002,Revue de pneumologie clinique
Reviewing images from portable media: an ongoing challenge.,"Distributing imaging data on por-table media has become a commonpractice. Imaging centers frequentlycopy imaging examinations to porta-ble media such as CDs (or DVDs)for patients and referring physi-cians.

Alterna-tively, physicians may choose to re-view the images directly from theoutside CDs using PCs.When there is no mechanism toincorporate the examination into aPACS or when a PACS is not used,such as in an outpatient private of-ï¬ce, image-viewing software isneeded.

Fluoroscopy-guided transurethral removal and exchange of ureteral stents in female patients: technical notes.,"PURPOSE
To describe simple and safe techniques for transurethral removal and for exchange of ureteral stents in female patients under fluoroscopic guidance.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
During a period of 33 months, the authors removed 4 and exchanged 34 double-J ureteral stents in 17 female patients. Four techniques were implemented to remove or exchange these stents: simple snare technique, modified snare technique, guide-wire lasso technique, and direct grasping technique.


RESULTS
All stents were either exchanged or removed successfully. The average time elapsed per procedure was 21.5 minutes. Simple snare techniques were used with 19 (50%) stents, and modified snare techniques were used with 13 (34%) stents where grasping the tip of a stent was not possible with the snare alone. Lasso and direct grasping techniques were each used with three (8%) stents. Self-limited microscopic hematuria was observed in all subjects after the procedure, but none reported gross hematuria.


CONCLUSIONS
Fluoroscopy-guided transurethral removal and exchange of ureteral stents is a safe and effective procedure, and it can be considered as an alternative to cystoscopic removal and exchange.",2007,Journal of vascular and interventional radiology : JVIR

Integration and comparison of different genomic data for outcome prediction in cancer,"BackgroundIn cancer, large-scale technologies such as next-generation sequencing and microarrays have produced a wide number of genomic features such as DNA copy number alterations (CNA), mRNA expression (EXPR), microRNA expression (MIRNA), and DNA somatic mutations (MUT), among others. Several analyses of a specific type of these genomic data have generated many prognostic biomarkers in cancer. However, it is uncertain which of these data is more powerful and whether the best data-type is cancer-type dependent.Therefore, our purpose is to characterize the prognostic power of models obtained from different genomic data types, cancer types, and algorithms. For this, we compared the prognostic power using the concordance and prognostic index of models obtained from EXPR, MIRNA, CNA, MUT data and their integration for ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma (OV), multiform glioblastoma (GBM), lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), and breast cancer (BRCA) datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas repository. We used three different algorithms for prognostic model selection based on constrained particle swarm optimization (CPSO), network feature selection (NFS), and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO).ResultsThe integration of the four genomic data produced models having slightly higher performance than any single genomic data. From the genomic data types, we observed better prediction using EXPR closely followed by MIRNA and CNA depending on the cancer type and method. We observed higher concordance index in BRCA, followed by LUAD, OV, and GBM. We observed very similar results between LASSO and CPSO but smaller values in NFS. Importantly, we observed that model predictions highly concur between algorithms but are highly discordant between data types, which seems to be dependent on the censoring rate of the dataset.ConclusionsGene expression (mRNA) generated higher performances, which is marginally improved when other type of genomic data is considered. The level of concordance in prognosis generated from different genomic data types seems to be dependent on censoring rate.",2015,BioData Mining
"Threatened Fishes of the World: Elassoma alabamae Mayden, 1993 (Elassomatidae)","Common names: Spring Pygmy Sunfish. Conservation status: Protected by Alabama State Non-game Species Regulation 2202-.92. Recently removed from the US Fish and Wildlife Services Candidate list of Endangered or Threatened species. Identification: D Iâ€“III/8 â€“ 13, A Iâ€“III/5 â€“ 8, C 10 â€“ 13, P 14 â€“ 19, V I/5 â€“ 6. Lateral scales 27 â€“ 32 (unpored), transverse scale rows 10 â€“ 13, circumpeduncular scales 15 â€“ 20, distinguished from all other family members by having III or less dorsal fin spines (versus IV or more), 6 â€“ 7 broad and dark bars along flanks (versus 7 or more), 16 â€“ 18 caudal peduncle scale rows (versus 18 â€“ 24) (Mayden 1993). Distribution: Endemic to the Tennessee River drainage in northern Alabama. First collected in 1937 from Cave Spring near Smithsonia, Lauderdale County (population extirpated), an additional population was discovered in The Pryor Springs system in 1941 (natural population extirpated). This species was thought to be extinct until its rediscovery in 1973 along margins of a spring-fed lake within Beaverdam Swamp, Limestone County, this species has since been found in several areas of the drainage, including Moss Spring, Beaverdam Creek, and Lowesâ€™ Ditch (Boschung & Mayden 2004). Abundance: Although geographically restricted, Elassoma alabamae is locally common, particularly in the Moss spring system were it is the most common fish species (Dart & Hooper 1991). Habitat and ecology: The clear waters of the Beaverdam Swamp system flow over a substrate consisting largely of fine sand, clay, mud and/or limestone. Elassoma alabamae is most commonly found above the substrate in association with rooted, submerged vegetation (generally Ceratophyllum, Myriophyllum, Utricularia and Elodea). Dart & Hooper (1991) have suggested that E. alabamae is very mobile and uses different spring and swamp macrohabitats at different times of the year. Reproduction: Spawnings occur in March and April (Dart & Hooper 1991). Females may produce up to 65 eggs (Mettee & Ramsey 1986). Elassoma alabamae is thought to be an annual species (Mettee 1974, Mettee & Ramsey 1986, Dart & Hooper 1991). Threats: Remaining habitat is surrounded by pasture, secondary growth and agriculture. Additionally a significant portion of the remaining Beaverdam swamp catchment area is dusted aerially with pesticides and herbicides. Conservation actions:An agreement exists between landowners at Moss Spring and Beaverdam Swamp, the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, which serves to maintain the habitat of the last remaining natural population of E. alabamae. In 1984/85 adults from Moss Spring were successfully introduced in to Lower Pryor Spring (Mettee & Pulliam 1986). Conservation recommendations: Restricted geographic distribution and high sensitivity to habitat alteration justify the protection of this species and its habitat. The removal of E. alabamae from the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Services Candidate List for Endangered and Threatened species seems unjustified and we recommend this species be reconsidered for state and federal protection. Remarks: E. alabamae is the only member of the family to have its entire geographic distribution above the Fall Line.",2005,Environmental Biology of Fishes
Multiple Kernel and Multi-label Learning for Image Categorization,"MULTIPLE KERNEL AND MULTI-LABEL LEARNING FOR IMAGE CATEGORIZATION By Serhat Selcuk Bucak One crucial step in recovering useful information from large image collections is image categorization. The goal of image categorization is to find the relevant labels for a given image from a closed set of labels. Despite the huge interest and significant contributions by the research community, there remains much room for improvement in the image categorization task. In this dissertation, we develop efficient multiple kernel learning and multi-label learning algorithms with high prediction performance for image categorization. There are many image representation methods available in the literature. However, it is not possible to pick one as the best method for image categorization, since different representations work better in different scenarios. Multiple kernel learning (MKL), a natural extension of kernel methods for information fusion, is often used by researchers to improve image representation by integrating it to the learning step for selecting and combining different image features. MKL is mostly considered as a binary classification tool, and it is difficult to scale up MKL when the number of labels is large. We address this computational challenge by developing a stochastic approximation based framework for MKL that aims to learn a single kernel combination that benefits all classes. Another contribution of this dissertation is to develop efficient multi-label learning algorithms. Multi-label learning is arguably the most suitable formulation for the image categorization task. Many researchers have employed decomposition methods, particularly one-vs-all framework, with SVM (support vector machines) as a base classifier for addressing the image categorization problem. However, the decomposition methods have several shortcomings, such as their inability to exploit label correlations. Further, they suffer from imbalanced data distributions when the number of labels is large. Our contribution is to address multi-label learning via a ranking approach, termed multi-label ranking. Given a test image, multi-label ranking algorithms aim to order all the image classes such that the relevant classes are ranked higher than the irrelevant ones. The advantage of the proposed multi-label ranking approach, termed MLR-L1 (multi-label ranking with L1 norm), over other multi-label learning methods is its computational efficiency and high prediction performance. Image categorization is a supervised learning task, thus requiring a large set of training images annotated by humans. Unfortunately, labeling is an expensive process, and it is often the case that the annotators provide a limited set of labels, meaning that they only give a small subset of relevant tags for an image. One of the contributions of this dissertation is defining the problem of multi-label learning with incomplete class assignments and presenting a robust multi-label ranking algorithm, termed MLR-GL (multi-label ranking with group lasso norm), that addresses the challenge of learning from incompletely labeled data. Finally, we present a multiple kernel multi-label ranking algorithm to simultaneously address two essential factors for improving the performance of image categorization: Heterogeneous information fusion, and exploiting label correlations in multi-label data. We propose a multiple kernel multi-label ranking method that learns a shared sparse kernel combination that benefits all image classes. This way, we not only improve the training and prediction efficiency, but also improve the accuracy, particularly for classes with a small number of samples, by enabling information sharing between classes. We integrate the proposed MLR-L1 algorithm with an efficient semi-infinite linear programming (SILP) based MKL solver and develop a computationally efficient wrapper algorithm, termed MK-MLR (multiple kernel multi-label ranking).",2014,

On estimating covariances between many assets with histories of highly variable length,"Quantitative portfolio allocation requires the accurate and tractable estimation of covariances between a large number of assets, whose histories can greatly vary in length. Such data are said to follow a monotone missingness pattern, under which the likelihood has a convenient factorization. Upon further assuming that asset returns are multivariate normally distributed, with histories at least as long as the total asset count, maximum likelihood (ML) estimates are easily obtained by performing repeated ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions, one for each asset. Things get more interesting when there are more assets than historical returns. OLS becomes unstable due to rankâ€“deficient design matrices, which is called a â€œbig p small nâ€ problem. We explore remedies that involve making a change of basis, as in principal components or partial least squares regression, or by applying shrinkage methods like ridge regression or the lasso. This enables the estimation of covariances between large sets of assets",2007,arXiv: Methodology
Reversible data hiding using least square predictor via the LASSO,"Reversible watermarking is a kind of digital watermarking which is able to recover the original image exactly as well as extracting hidden message. Many algorithms have aimed at lower image distortion in higher embedding capacity. In the reversible data hiding, the role of efficient predictors is crucial. Recently, adaptive predictors using least square approach have been proposed to overcome the limitation of the fixed predictors. This paper proposes a novel reversible data hiding algorithm using least square predictor via least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). This predictor is dynamic in nature rather than fixed. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the previous methods including some algorithms which are based on the least square predictors.",2016,EURASIP Journal on Image and Video Processing
Preoperative prediction of sentinel lymph node metastasis in breast cancer by radiomic signatures from dynamic contrastâ€enhanced MRI,"BACKGROUND
Sentinel lymph node (SLN) status is an important prognostic factor for patients with breast cancer, which is currently determined in clinical practice by invasive SLN biopsy.


PURPOSE
To noninvasively predict SLN metastasis in breast cancer using dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) intra- and peritumoral radiomics features combined with or without clinicopathologic characteristics of the primary tumor.


STUDY TYPE
Retrospective.


POPULATION
A total of 163 breast cancer patients (55 positive SLN and 108 negative SLN).


FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE
1.5T, T1 -weighted DCE-MRI.


ASSESSMENT
A total of 590 radiomic features were extracted for each patient from both intratumoral and peritumoral regions of interest. To avoid overfitting, the dataset was randomly separated into a training set (âˆ¼67%) and a validation set (âˆ¼33%). The prediction models were built with the training set using logistic regression on the most significant radiomic features in the training set combined with or without clinicopathologic characteristics. The prediction performance was further evaluated in the independent validation set.


STATISTICAL TESTS
Mann-Whitney U-test, Spearman correlation, least absolute shrinkage selection operator (LASSO) regression, logistic regression, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis were performed.


RESULTS
Combining radiomic features with clinicopathologic characteristics, six features were automatically selected in the training set to establish the prediction model of SLN metastasis. In the independent validation set, the area under ROC curve (AUC) was 0.869 (NPVâ€‰=â€‰0.886). Using radiomic features alone in the same procedure, 4 features were selected and the validation set AUC was 0.806 (NPVâ€‰=â€‰0.824).


DATA CONCLUSION
This is the first attempt to demonstrate the feasibility of using DCE-MRI radiomics to predict SLN metastasis in breast cancer. Clinicopathologic characteristics improved the prediction performance. This study provides noninvasive methods to evaluate SLN status for guiding further treatment of breast cancer patients, and can potentially benefit those with negative SLN, by eliminating unnecessary invasive lymph node removal and the associated complications, which is a step further towards precision medicine.

Free Energy Calculations of Microcin J25 Variants Binding to the FhuA Receptor.,"Computer simulations were performed to study the antimicrobial peptide microcin J25 (MJ25), a 21-mer peptide with an unusual lasso structure and high activity against Gram-negative bacteria. MJ25 has intracellular targets. The initial step of MJ25 acquisition in bacterial cells is binding to the outer-membrane receptor FhuA. Molecular dynamics simulations were implemented to study the binding mechanism of MJ25 to FhuA and to search for important binding residues. The absolute binding free energy calculated from combined free energy perturbation and thermodynamic integration methods agrees well with experimental data. In addition, computational mutation analysis revealed that His5 is the key residue responsible for MJ25 and FhuA association. We found that the number of hydrogen bonds is essential for binding of MJ25 to FhuA. This atomistic, quantitative insight sheds light on the mechanism of action of MJ25 and may pave a path for designing active MJ25 analogues.",2017,Journal of chemical theory and computation
The physiological ecology of UV-absorbing compounds from the mucus of marine fishes,"This dissertation details my investigation into the physiological ecology of UV-absorbing compounds found in the mucus of marine fishes. In a survey of over 200 species of fishes from around the Pacific, I found that approximately 90% of fishes possess mucus that absorbs strongly in the UV. High-performance liquid chromatography of selected mucus confirmed that the UV-absorbing compounds in the mucus are mycosporine-like amino acids, or MAAs. I determined that the mucus of experimentally UV-exposed Thalassoma duperrey absorbs more strongly in the UV than the mucus of those protected from UV by UV-opaque (but visible light transparent) plastic. However, this difference in mucus absorbance only occurs if fish are provided a dietary source of MAAs. Furthermore, I found that males have higher mucus absorbance than females, and females exposed to UV suffer high rates of skin damage. Females also sequester MAAs in their eggs, and may suffer a conflict of interest between providing sunscreen protection for their eggs vs. their own skin. Three coral reef fish species (Canthigaster jactator, Chaetodon multicinctus, and Thalassoma duperrey) were sampled over a depth gradient, and shallow water fish generally had superior sunscreen, both in terms of magnitude and shortwavelength spectral shifting, as compared with deeper water individuals of the same species.",2003,
Signal reshaping and noise suppression using photonic crystal Fano structures,"We experimentally demonstrate the use of photonic crystal Fano resonances for reshaping optical data signals. We show that the combination of an asymmetric Fano resonance and carrier-induced nonlinear effects in a nanocavity can be used to realize a nonlinear power transfer function, which is a key functionality for optical signal regeneration, particularly for suppression of amplitude fluctuations of data signals. The experimental results are explained using simulations based on coupled-mode theory and also compared to the case of using conventional Lorentzian-shaped resonances. Using indium phosphide photonic crystal membrane structures, we demonstrate reshaping of 2 Gbit/s and 10 Gbit/s return-to-zero on-off keying (RZ-OOK) data signals at telecom wavelengths around 1550 nm. Eye diagrams of the reshaped signals show that amplitude noise fluctuations can be significantly suppressed. The reshaped signals are quantitatively analyzed using bit-error ratio (BER) measurements, which show up to 2 dB receiver sensitivity improvement at a BER of 10âˆ’9 compared to a degraded input noisy signal. Due to efficient light-matter interaction in the high-quality factor and small mode-volume photonic crystal nanocavity, low energy consumption, down to 104 fJ/bit and 41 fJ/bit for 2 Gbit/s and 10 Gbit/s, respectively, has been achieved. Device perspectives and limitations are discussed.

Network Analysis of PTSD Symptoms Following Mass Violence,"Objective: Network analysis is a useful tool for understanding how symptoms interact with one another to influence psychopathology. However, this analytic strategy has not been fully utilized in the PTSD field. The current study utilized network analysis to examine connectedness and strength among PTSD symptoms (employing both partial correlation and regression network analyses) among a community sample of students exposed to the 2007 Virginia Tech shootings. Method: Respondents (N = 4,639) completed online surveys 3â€“4 months postshootings, with PTSD symptom severity measured via the Trauma Symptom Questionnaire. Results: Data were analyzed via adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and relative importance networks, as well as Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to identify the shortest path from each symptom to all other symptoms. Relative importance network analysis revealed that intrusive thoughts had the strongest influence on other symptoms (i.e., had many strong connections [highest outdegree]) while computing Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm indicated that anger produced the shortest path to all other symptoms (i.e., the strongest connections to all other symptoms). Conclusion: Findings suggest that anger or intrusion likely play a crucial role in the development and maintenance of PTSD (i.e., are more influential within the network than are other symptoms).",2018,"Psychological Trauma: Theory, Research, Practice, and Policy"

An Algorithmic Approach to Linear Regression,"We analyze a procedure how to build a high quality linear regression model. We start with an overview of the desirable properties, for example robustness and limited pairwise multicollinearity, of the linear regression model. We discuss the problem that the current approaches are not capable to find a linear regression model with the desirable properties. Therefore, our goal is to find a procedure that produces a linear regression model which achieves the desirable properties in a reasonable amount of time. We present an algorithmic approach in which the desirable properties are modeled as constraints and through penalties in the objective function of a Mixed Integer Quadratic Optimization (MIQO) model. The performance of the algorithm is shown on both real and synthetic data sets, and is compared with the widely used Lasso approach from Tibshirani (1996). Lastly, we extent the MIQO model with a heuristically chosen subset of interaction terms and compare the performance of the",2018,
Team communication behaviors of the human-automation teaming,"If synthetic teammates are to be considered â€œteam playersâ€, then they must be better equipped to handle the subtleties of communication and coordination with their human teammates. In this study, the team communication behaviors of a human-automation team were analyzed for the identification of which are the best predictors of team performance. The LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) method was used to select the team communication behaviors that were the best predictors of team performance and, in the end, 16 such role related communication behaviors (at both the role and condition level) were included in the final model. Findings indicate that in general, negatively perceived communication behaviors are predictors of negative team performance. Through this study, we also learned that even when human team members follow their optimal and expected communication behaviors when communicating with a synthetic teammate, these behaviors are still predictors of negative team performance. This finding holds important future considerations: even if human team members are properly communicating with a synthetic teammate, the errors and lack of human-like behavior on the part of the latter can still result in a negative team performance.",2016,2016 IEEE International Multi-Disciplinary Conference on Cognitive Methods in Situation Awareness and Decision Support (CogSIMA)

Di Serbatoi Non Ancorati Simplified Models of Unanchored Steel Tanks for Seismic Fragility Analysis,"Seismic behaviour of steel tanks for oil storage is relevant in the light of industrial risk assessment because collapse of these structures may trigger other catastrophic phenomena, as fires or explosions due to loss containment. Damages suffered by storage tanks under seismic actions are generally related to large axial compressive stresses that can induce shell buckling near the base and to large displacements of unanchored structures leading to detachment of piping. The present paper approaches the analysis of seismic response of sliding, nonuplifting, unanchored liquid storage tanks subject to three-dimensional ground motion. A procedure to solve the equation of motion for a simplified tankâ€™s model is proposed and a sample estimation of the seismic demand by incremental dynamic analysis is discussed. SOMMARIO La risposta sismica dei serbatoi in acciaio per lo stoccaggio di olio combustibile ha grande importanza nelle valutazioni di rischio industriale per le conseguenze che il collasso strutturale o piÃ¹ in particolare la perdita del contenuto possono generare. Lâ€™esame dei danni subiti dai serbatoi non ancorati in occasione di terremoti dimostra la prevalenza di due modalitÃ  di rottura: lâ€™instabilitÃ  del mantello in prossimitÃ  della piastra di base per eccesso di azione assiale e lo spostamento rigido del serbatoio. Il presente lavoro inquadra il problema dellâ€™analisi della risposta dei serbatoi soggetti ad azioni sismiche tridimensionali. Viene proposta una procedura per la risoluzione dellâ€™equazione del moto di un modello semplificato della struttura; esso rappresenta un utile strumento per la valutazione della domanda sismica, della quale viene presentata a titolo di esempio una stima, nelle piÃ¹ generali procedure per le analisi di fragilitÃ .",2005,
Incremental Manifold Learning Via Tangent Space Alignment,"Several algorithms have been proposed to analysis the structure of high-dimensional data based on the notion of manifold learning. They have been used to extract the intrinsic characteristic of different type of high-dimensional data by performing nonlinear dimensionality reduction. Most of them operate in a â€œbatchâ€ mode and cannot be efficiently applied when data are collected sequentially. In this paper, we proposed an incremental version (ILTSA) of LTSA (Local Tangent Space Alignment), which is one of the key manifold learning algorithms. Besides, a landmark version of LTSA (LLTSA) is proposed, where landmarks are selected based on LASSO regression, which is well known to favor sparse approximations because it uses regularization with l1 norm. Furthermore, an incremental version (ILLTSA) of LLTSA is also proposed. Experimental results on synthetic data and real word data sets demonstrate the effectivity of our algorithms.",2006,

Performance of Dower's inverse transform and Frank lead system for Identification of Myocardial Infarction,This study performs a comparison between Dower's inverse transform and Frank lead system for Myocardial Infarction (MI) identification. We have selected a set of relevant features for MI detection from the vectorcardiogram and used the lasso method after that to build a model for the Dower's inverse transform and one for the Frank leads system. Then we analyzed the performance between both models on MI detection. The proposed methods have been tested using PhysioNet PTB database that contains 550 records from which 368 are MIs. Two main conclusions are coming from this study. The first one is that Dower's inverse transform performs equally well than Frank leads in identification of MI patients. The second one is that lead positions have a large influence on the accuracy of MI patient identification.,2015,2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)
A Scalable Algorithm for Structured Kernel Feature Selection,"Kernel methods are powerful tools for nonlinear feature representation. Incorporated with structured LASSO, the kernelized structured LASSO is an effective feature selection approach that can preserve the nonlinear input-output relationships as well as the structured sparseness. But as the data dimension increases, the method can quickly become computationally prohibitive. In this paper we propose a stochastic optimization algorithm that can efficiently address this computational problem on account of the redundant kernel representations of the given data. Experiments on simulation data and PET 3D brain image data show that our method can achieve superior accuracy with less computational cost than existing methods.",2015,
Meteorological factors affecting respiratory syncytial virus infection: A time-series analysis.,"INTRODUCTION
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is a major cause of hospitalization in children. Meteorological factors are known to influence seasonal RSV epidemics, but the relationship between meteorological factors and RSV infection in children is not well understood. We aimed to explore the relationship between meteorological factors and RSV infections among hospitalized children, using different statistical models.


METHODS
We conducted a retrospective review concerning children with RSV infections admitted to a tertiary pediatric hospital in Wenzhou, China, between January 2008 and December 2017. The relationship between meteorological factors (average daily temperatures, average daily relative humidity, rainfall, rainfall days, and wind speed) and the incidence of RSV in hospitalized children was analyzed using three time-series models, namely an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, a generalized additive model (GAM), and a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)-based model.


RESULTS
In total, 15â€‰858 (17.6%) children tested positive for RSV infection. The ARIMA model revealed a marked seasonal pattern in the RSV detection rate, which peaked in winter and spring. The model was a good predictor of RSV incidence (R2 : 83.5%). The GAM revealed that a lower temperature and higher wind speed preceded increases in RSV detection. The LASSO-based model revealed that temperature and relative humidity were negatively correlated with RSV detection.


CONCLUSIONS
Seasonality of RSV infection in hospitalized children correlated strongly with temperature. The LASSO-based model can be used to predict annual RSV epidemics using weather forecast data.",2020,Pediatric pulmonology
The Nature of Volatility Spillovers across the International Capital Markets,"This paper studies the nature of volatility spillovers across countries from the perspective of network theory and by relying on data of US-listed ETFs. I use a Lasso-related technique to estimate the International Volatility Network (IVN) where the nodes correspond to large-cap international stock markets while the links account for significant volatility lead-lags. Also included in the analysis is the International Trade Network (ITN), whose links measure bilateral export-import flows thus, capturing fundamental interconnections between countries. I find that the IVN and the ITN resemble each other closely pointing out that volatility does not disseminate randomly but tends to spread across fundamentally related economies. I also note that the amount of lagged volatility reactions in the IVN is consistent with the notion of gradual diffusion of information across investors who are subject to limited attention and home bias. I formally test this hypothesis by using as a direct proxy of investorsâ€™ attention the aggregate search frequency in Google. The empirical results support this intuition indicating that higher volatility surprises in key foreign markets predict higher domestic attention upon those markets in subsequent days. Once domestic attention is captured by such external shocks, it is contemporaneously transformed into higher domestic volatility.",2016,
Long-term comparison of the fish community in a Costa Rican rocky shore marine reserve.,"Despite their role in supporting diverse marine fish communities, tropical rocky shores and reefs have attracted less research and fewer targeted conservation efforts compared to coral reefs. We studied fish community composition in Playa Blanca Marine Reserve (9 degrees 40' N - 84 degrees 40' W), a rocky shore site on the central Pacific coast of Costa Rica. We conducted visual surveys of fishes along six strip transects soon after the area was designated a marine reserve in 1995, then again in 2006 following an eleven-year period of complete protection. We recorded a total of 31 406 sightings of 72 species from 30 families. Pomacentrids (42.5%), labrids (16.6%) and haemulids (14.8%) dominated the community, accounting for > 70% of total fish abundance. In comparison to other sites in the region, the fish community was more similar to one reported from Bahia Honda, Panama (7 degrees 50' N - 81 degrees 35 W) than from the geographically more proximate Culebra Bay, Costa Rica (10 degrees 45' N - 85 degrees 43 W). Sixty-one species from 26 families were recorded in 1995; sixty-nine species from 28 families in 2006. Our results suggest that the Playa Blanca Marine Reserve is fulfilling its conservation role. Average fish abundance, species richness and Shannon's index of community diversity were greater in 2006 than 1995, and fish community composition varied significantly within each transect among years. Much of the change in community composition among years resulted from spatial and temporal variation in the abundance of a few dominant species, including Abudefduf troschelli, Thalassoma lucasanum, Chromis atrilobata, and Stegastes flavilatus/acapulcoensis. Of the 48 species/species groups recorded in both years, 37 (77%) were more abundant in 2006 than 1995, and several species recorded as uncommon or rare in 1995 were more frequent and abundant in 2006. Fish community composition and the abundance of some species changed in the reserve over time, but further study is needed to determine the role of small-scale marine reserves in the conservation of tropical marine biodiversity.",2011,Revista de biologia tropical

Evaluating associations between early pregnancy trace elements mixture and 2nd trimester gestational glucose levels: A comparison of three statistical approaches.,"OBJECTIVE
Studies have shown that individual trace element levels might be associated with abnormal glycemic status, with implications for diabetes. Few studies have considered these trace elements as a mixture and their impact on gestational glucose levels. Comparing three statistical approaches, we assessed the associations between essential trace elements mixture and gestational glucose levels.


METHODS
We used data from 1720 women enrolled in the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development's Fetal Growth Study, for whom trace element concentrations (zinc, selenium, copper, molybdenum) were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) using plasma collected during the 1st trimester. Non-fasting glucose levels were measured during the gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) screening test in the 2nd trimester. We applied (1) Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR); (2) adaptive Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) in a mutually adjusted linear regression model; and (3) generalized additive models (GAMs) to evaluate the joint associations between trace elements mixture and glucose levels adjusting for potential confounders.


RESULTS
Using BKMR, we observed a mean 2.7Â mg/dL higher glucose level for each interquartile increase of plasma copper (95% credible interval: 0.9, 4.5). The positive association between plasma copper and glucose levels was more pronounced at higher quartiles of zinc. Similar associations were detected using adaptive LASSO and GAM. In addition, results from adaptive LASSO and GAM suggested a super-additive interaction between molybdenum and selenium (both p-valuesÂ =Â 0.04).


CONCLUSION
Employing different statistical methods, we found consistent evidence of higher gestational glucose levels associated with higher copper and potential synergism between zinc and copper on glucose levels.",2019,International journal of hygiene and environmental health
Predicting risk of chemotherapy-induced severe neutropenia: A pooled analysis in individual patients data with advanced lung cancer.,"OBJECTIVES
Neutropenia is associated with the risk of life-threatening infections, chemotherapy dose reductions and delays that may compromise outcomes. This analysis was conducted to develop a prediction model for chemotherapy-induced severe neutropenia in lung cancer.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Individual patient data from existing cooperative group phase II/III trials of stages III/IV non-small cell lung cancer or extensive small-cell lung cancer were included. The data were split into training and testing sets. In order to enhance the prediction accuracy and the reliability of the prediction model, lasso method was used for both variable selection and regularization on the training set. The selected variables was fit to a logistic model to obtain regression coefficients. The performance of the final prediction model was evaluated by the area under the ROC curve in both training and testing sets.


RESULTS
The dataset was randomly separated into training [7606 (67 %) patients] and testing [3746 (33 %) patients] sets. The final model included: age (>65 years), gender (male), weight (kg), BMI, insurance status (yes/unknown), stage (IIIB/IV/ESSCLC), number of metastatic sites (1, 2 or â‰¥3), individual drugs (gemcitabine, taxanes), number of chemotherapy agents (2 or â‰¥3), planned use of growth factors, associated radiation therapy, previous therapy (chemotherapy, radiation, surgery), duration of planned treatment, pleural effusion (yes/unknown), performance status (1, â‰¥2) and presence of symptoms (yes/unknown).


CONCLUSIONS
We have developed a relatively simple model with routinely available pre-treatment variables, to predict for neutropenia. This model should be independently validated prospectively.",2020,Lung cancer
Summer 8-12-2011 Statistical Methods in Mapping Complex Diseases,"Genome-wide association studies have become a standard tool for disease gene discovery over the past few years. These studies have successfully identified genetic variants attributed to complex diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer. Various statistical methods have been developed with the goal of improving power to find disease causing variants. The major focus of this dissertation is to develop statistical methods related to gene mapping studies with its application in real datasets to identify genetic markers associated with complex human diseases. In my first project, I developed a method to detect gene-gene interactions by incorporating linkage disequilibrium (LD) information provided by external datasets such as the International HapMap or the 1000 Genomes Projects. The next two projects in my dissertation are related to the analysis of secondary phenotypes in case-control genetic association studies. In these studies, a set of correlated secondary phenotypes that may share common genetic factors with disease status are often collected. However, due to unequal sampling probabilities between cases and controls, the standard regression approach for examination of these secondary phenotype can yield inflated type I error rates when the test SNPs are associated with the disease. To solve this issue, I propose a Gaussian copula approach to jointly model the disease status and the secondary phenotype. In my second project, I consider only one marker in the model and perform a test to access whether the marker is associated with the secondary phenotype in the Gaussian copula framework. In my third project, I extend the copula-based approach to include a large number of candidate SNPs in the model. I propose a variable selection approach to select markers which are associated with the secondary phenotype by applying a lasso penalty to the log-likelihood function.

Eclampsia gravidica con sequele neurologiche a distanza,"L'eclampsia gravidica costituisce una infrequente ma grave complicanza in corso di sindrome gestosica ed Ã¨ caratterizzata da episodi di convulsioni generalizzate seguiti da coma che generalmente recede in un breve lasso di tempo. A questi tipici sintomi principali si associano altri segni di interessamento del sistema nervoso centrale, spesso di natura focale, che in passato sono stati descritti come a rapida risoluzione (2â€“3 giorni) senza reliquati sia dal punto di vista clinico che radiologico, ove si escludano gli infrequenti casi (5%) in cui si osserva l'instaurarsi di una grave emorragia cerebrale capace di condurre al decesso la paziente.

An Ordered Lasso and Sparse Time-Lagged Regression,"We consider regression scenarios where it is natural to impose an order constraint on the coefficients. We propose an order-constrained version of l1-regularized regression (Lasso) for this problem, and show how to solve it efficiently using the well-known pool adjacent violators algorithm as its proximal operator. The main application of this idea is to time-lagged regression, where we predict an outcome at time t from features at the previous K time points. In this setting, it is natural to assume that the coefficients decay as we move farther away from t, and hence the order constraint is reasonable. Potential application areas include financial time series and prediction of dynamic patient outcomes based on clinical measurements. We illustrate this idea on real and simulated data.",2016,Technometrics
The extremophiles of Great Salt Lake: Complex microbiology in a dynamic hypersaline ecosystem,"Abstract Great Salt Lake, Utah, is thalassohaline, terminal lake that currently occupies the Bonneville Basin, a depression in the larger Great Basin area of the western United States. Natural processes and climate conditions create a dynamic ecosystem with shifting salinity gradients and lake levels. Great Salt Lake has also been subjected to anthropomorphic impacts, perhaps most significantly, a railroad causeway that has created an isolated, hypersaline north arm. The lakeâ€™s enormous size, various microniches, salinity gradients, and unique geochemistry support a variety of life in its waters. Two invertebrates feed a diverse avian community, but the complexity of the ecosystem lies at the microbial level. Halophilic microbial extremophiles provide energy and nutrient turnover for the system. This review provides a biological inventory in the context of an ever-changing Great Salt Lake. The microbial diversity includes communities of bacteria, archaea, phytoplankton, protists, and fungi; the latter of which is framed with new data presented here. The biogeochemistry of microbialites is discussed as an example of complex microbial communities working together in the lake. Great Salt Lake is both a model for the limits of life on Earth and for potential life on other space bodies. The lakeâ€™s minerals (halite and gypsum) on the shores, in the sediment, and in the surrounding evaporite deposits have biopreservation abilities, protecting halophilic cells and their molecules in brine fluid inclusions. These observations suggest Great Salt Lake is an appropriate analogue for the study of ancient salt lakes and evaporites discovered on Mars.",2019,

In-network Sparsity-regularized Rank Minimization: Algorithms and Applications,"Given a limited number of entries from the superposition of a low-rank matrix plus the product of a known compression matrix times a sparse matrix, recovery of the low-rank and sparse components is a fundamental task subsuming compressed sensing, matrix com pletion, and principal components pursuit. This paper develops algorithms for distributed sparsity-regularized rank minimization over networks, when the nuclearand l1-norm are used as surrogates to the rank and nonzero entry cou nts f the sought matrices, respectively. While nuclear-norm minimization has well-documented merits when centralized processing is viable, non-separability of the singular-va lue sum challenges its distributed minimization. To overcome this limitation, an alternative characterizat ion of the nuclear norm is adopted which leads to a separable, yet non-convex cost minimized via the altern a ing-direction method of multipliers. The novel distributed iterations entail reduced-complexity p er-node tasks, and affordable message passing among single-hop neighbors. Interestingly, if the distrib uted (non-convex) estimator converges, under certain conditions it provably attains the global optimum o f its centralized counterpart. Several application domains are outlined to highlight the generality and impact of the proposed framework. These include unveiling traffic anomalies in backbone networks, and predi cting networkwide path latencies. Simulations with synthetic and real network data confirm the convergence of the novel distributed algorithm, and its centralized performance guarantees.

Schooling as contraception,This book chapter gives an overview of the main general issues that arose in the workshop on the interrelationships between female schooling and fertility decline in South Asia. The authors refer to Karen Masons five potential explanations for demographic change. This workshop emphasized the importance of defining the indicators and differentiating carefully between indicators. This workshop emphasized the complexity of the relationships. The authors refer to Tim Dyson and Mick Moores work that defines autonomy as the ability to obtain information and use it as the basis for making decisions. Historical changes in autonomy are not mere changes in level of schooling. Even a multidimensional definition of autonomy has operational problems particularly in South Asia. The issue of womens reproductive rights is more important than autonomy issues. Without access to contraception it is irrelevant how fully autonomous women are. If autonomy is measured by self-perception then the question arises as to who has more autonomy. Visaria defines autonomy by decision making freedom of movement and domestic autonomy. Vlassoff defines autonomy as exposure to the outside world marriage partner choice dowry and domestic decision making. Many favor the emergence of criteria for determining autonomy from womens discussions rather than as answers to direct questions. The general finding is that the relationship between schooling and autonomy is not a consistent or linear one. Social context or sociocultural patterns explain only some links. Ideational change is key to explaining the relationship. Increasing female schooling is not the sole ingredient for solving fertility and social problems.,1996,
Application of group smoothly clipped absolute deviation method in identifying correlates of psychiatric distress among college students,"College students are at an increased risk of psychiatric distress. So, identifying its important correlates using more reliable statistical models, instead of inefficient traditional variable selection methods like stepwise regression, is of great importance. The objective of this study was to investigate correlates of psychiatric distress among college students in Iran; using group smoothly clipped absolute deviation method (SCAD). A number of 1259 voluntary college students participated in this cross-sectional study (Jan-May 2016) at Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Iran. The data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire consisting of demographic information, a behavioral risk factors checklist and the GHQ-28 questionnaire (with a cut-off of 23 to measure psychiatric distress, recommended by the Iranian version of the questionnaire). Penalized logistic regression with a group-SCAD regularization method was used to analyze the data (Î±â€‰=â€‰0.05). The majority of students were aged 18â€“25 (87.61%), and 60.76% of them were female. About 41% of students had psychiatric distress. Significant correlates of psychiatric distress among college students selected by group-SCAD included the average grade, educational level, being optimistic about future, having a boy/girlfriend, having an emotional breakup, the average daily number of cigarettes, substance abusing during previous month and having suicidal thoughts ever (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). Penalized logistic regression methods such as group-SCAD and group-Adaptive-LASSO should be considered as plausible alternatives to stepwise regression for identifying correlates of a binary response. Several behavioral variables were associated with psychological distress which highlights the necessity of designing multiple factors and behavioral changes in interventional programs.",2020,BMC Psychiatry
Monitoring of Lymphocyte Populations During Treatment with Interferon-Î²-1b to Predict Multiple Sclerosis Disability Progression.,"The authors aim to understand how lymphocyte populations could predict the course of multiple sclerosis (MS) in people treated with interferon-Î² (IFN-Î²). Twenty-five male patients and 72 female patients were analyzed in the study. Peripheral blood samples were taken before and 5 years after the treatment with IFN-Î². Lymphocyte subsets were analyzed by flow cytometry. The authors compared lymphocyte parameters between confirmed sustained progression (CSP) and non-CSP groups by using Welch's one-way analysis of means or a chi-square test of independence. A penalized (lasso) logistic regression model was fitted to identify the combination of lymphocyte parameters for potential biomarkers. The combination of lymphocyte counts, relative CD3+/CD25+ cells, absolute CD8 T cells, absolute CD8+/CD38+ cells, absolute CD38+ cells, and relative CD5+/CD19+ cells was identified as potential biomarker for the IFN-Î² treatment to monitor MS development in relation to CSP. The results suggest that other biomarkers aid in patient observation, predict a favorable outcome, and assist in the decision-making process for the early therapy escalation.",2019,Journal of interferon & cytokine research : the official journal of the International Society for Interferon and Cytokine Research

Every joule is precious: the case for revisiting operating system design for energy efficiency,"By some estimates, there will be close to one billion wirelessdevices capable of Internet connectivity within five years,surpassing the installed base of traditional wired compute devices.These devices will take the form of cellular phones, personaldigital assistants (PDA's), embedded processors, and ""Internetappliances"". This proliferation of networked computing devices willenable a number of compelling applications, centering aroundubiquitous access to global information services, just in timedelivery of personalized content, and tight synchronization amongcompute devices/appliances in our everyday environment. However,one of the principal challenges of realizing this vision in thepost-PC environment is the need to reduce the energy consumed inusing these next-generation mobile and wireless devices, therebyextending the lifetime of the batteries that power them. While theprocessing power, memory, and network bandwidth of post-PC devicesare increasing exponentially, their battery capacity is improvingat a more modest pace.
Thus, to ensure the utility of post-PC applications, it isimportant to develop low-level mechanisms and higher-level policiesto maximize energy efficiency. In this paper, we propose thesystematic re-examination of all aspects of operating system designand implementation from the point of view of energy efficiencyrather than the more traditional OS metric of maximizingperformance. In [7], we made the case for energy as a first-classOS-managed resource. We emphasized the benefits of higher-levelcontrol over energy usage policy and the application/OSinteractions required to achieve them. This paper explores theimplications that this major shift in focus can have upon theservices, policies, mechanisms, and internal structure of the OSitself based on our initial experiences with rethinking systemdesign for energy efficiency.
Our ultimate goal is to design an operating system where majorcomponents cooperate to explicitly optimize for energy efficiency.A number of research efforts have recently investigated aspects ofenergy-efficient operating systems (a good overview is available at[16, 20]) and we intend to leverage existing ""best practice"" in ourown work where such results exist. However, we are not aware of anysystems that systematically revisit system structure with energy inmind. Further, our examination of operating system functionalityreveals a number of opportunities that have received littleattention in the literature. To illustrate this point, Table 1presents major operating system functionality, along with possibletechniques for improving power consumption characteristics. Severalof the techniques are well studied, such as disk spindown policiesor adaptively trading content fidelity for power [8]. For example,to reduce power consumption for MPEG playback, the system couldadapt to a smaller frame rate and window size, consuming lessbandwidth and computation.
One of the primary objectives of operating systems is allocatingresources among competing tasks, typically for fairness andperformance. Adding energy efficiency to the equation raises anumber of interesting issues. For example, competingprocesses/users may be scheduled to receive a fair share ofbattery resources rather than CPU resources (e.g., anapplication that makes heavy use of DISK I/O may be given lowerpriority relative to a compute-bound application when energyresources are low). Similarly, for tasks such as ad hoc routing,local battery resources are often consumed on behalf of remoteprocesses. Fair allocation dictates that one battery is not drainedin preference to others. Finally, for the communication subsystem,a number of efforts already investigate adaptively setting thepolling rate for wireless networks (trading latency forenergy).
Our efforts to date have focused on the last four areashighlighted in Table 1. For memory allocation, our work exploreshow to exploit the ability of memory chips to transition amongmultiple power states. We also investigate metrics for pickingenergy-efficient routes in ad hoc networks, energy-efficientplacement of distributed computation, and flexible RPC/name bindingthat accounts for power consumption.
These last two points of resource allocation and remotecommunication highlight an interesting property for energy-aware OSdesign in the post-PC environment. Many tasks are distributedacross multiple machines, potentially running on machines withwidely varying CPU, memory, and power source characteristics. Thus,energy-aware OS design must closely cooperate with and track thecharacteristics of remote computers to balance the oftenconflicting goals of optimizing for energy and speed.
The rest of this paper illustrates our approach with selectedexamples extracted from our recent efforts toward building anintegrated hardware/software infrastructure that incorporatescooperative power management to support mobile and wirelessapplications. The instances we present in subsequent sections coverthe resource management policies and mechanisms necessary toexploit low power modes of various (existing or proposed) hardwarecomponents, as well as power-aware communications and the essentialrole of the wide-area environment. We begin our discussion with theresources of a single machine and then extend it to the distributedcontext.",2000,
Better Approximation and Faster Algorithm Using the Proximal Average,"It is a common practice to approximate ""complicated"" functions with more friendly ones. In large-scale machine learning applications, nonsmooth losses/regularizers that entail great computational challenges are usually approximated by smooth functions. We re-examine this powerful methodology and point out a nonsmooth approximation which simply pretends the linearity of the proximal map. The new approximation is justified using a recent convex analysis toolâ€” proximal average, and yields a novel proximal gradient algorithm that is strictly better than the one based on smoothing, without incurring any extra overhead. Numerical experiments conducted on two important applications, overlapping group lasso and graph-guided fused lasso, corroborate the theoretical claims.",2013,
The Collection Â»Neue Teutsche LiederÂ« (NÃ¼rnberg 1588) of Wolfgang Striccius,"Among the protestant musicians who were working at the time of Reformation in the former Dukedom of Carniola, Wolfgang Striccius is the only one whose works are at least partially preserved. He was born at Wunsdorf near Hannover but he was employed as cantor at the latin school in Ljubljana from April 2nd, 1588 till May, 1591, at least. In connection with the study of the music of the protestant era in Slovenia, his collection Â»Neue Teutsche LiederÂ« (Nurnberg 1588) demands attention, since its author is denoted as Â»cantor of the estates of CarniolaÂ« and since he himself wrote the dedication in Ljubljana May 1st, 1588. The collection consists of 21 compositions; all but two are devotional pieces. The texts are for the most part German versifications of biblical sentences from the Book of Prophets. Although the compositions are on the title page said to be for four parts, two of them are for three voices and one for two voices. From the dedication and annotation Â»mehrerer thails ad pares vocemÂ« it is clear that the pieces are set mostly for high voices and intended for a schoolboys' choir. The structure of the compositions in the collection Â»Neue Teutsche LiederÂ« is predominantly polyphonic, whereby the fundamental method of composition is imitation, respectively Â»durchimitierenÂ«. So Striccius followed the older tradition which was based on the principles descending from late Gothic. As a result of the simultaneous development of melodic lines there mostly appear triads, and sixth chords only seldom. At any rate in the pieces for four parts incomplete triads on the down beat, which are to be found here and there in nearly all compositions, attract attention. Among these, chords with the fifth and the eighth, which sound empty and sometimes raw and awkward, are especially characteristic. We have to do with a relic of past tradition revealing the conservative orientation of the composer. So, if the devotional songs of Striccius are compared with those of Lasso and Lechner, a remarkable difference in the quality of sound can be discerned. Among the modes used in this collection dorian and aeolian prevail. Yet this doesn't mean much because the composer still clings very strongly to the old modal system as is seen from the whole harmonic structure; a marked tendency towards a new tonal feeling is not yet present. The chords have not yet a functional role, and the single, short homophonic passages, as much as they appear here and there do not seem to be guided by harmonic principles. As far as the formal structure is concerned, two types of compositions can be found. The first is Â»durchkomponiertÂ« and usually contains several sections built in imitation. This type is identical with the motet form. The second is strophic and so several strophes, usually three, are sung to the same tune. Here most frequently the two part form AB occurs. Since these pieces also are mostly based on imitation technique, they remain in fact somewhere on the border between the lied and the motet form. In spite of the fact that we find some awkward spots occasionally and some awkwardness in the development of the parts, we must point out that Striccius, who was still very young and at the beginning of his career, was well acquainted with the principles of musical composition of his period and paid attention to them. The so-called forbidden progressions, which are here and there used even by the great masters, are found very seldom in Striccius. Also, as far as the treatment of dissonance is concerned, he almost always respected the rules. Though some spots do occur which display a somewhat freer treatment, Striccius is not an exception, for a greater or lesser deviation from the strict standard was usual in nearly all composers of the period. Though in the collection the older polyphonic principles strongly prevail, we must not overlook the fact that there are traces of a more modern attitude which has its origin in Italy. The completely homophonic structure and declamatory syllabic melodies of composition XIX and the extensive and effective tone-painting of composition VI most clearly illustrate this. The collection Â»Neue Teutsche LiederÂ«, which was surely also performed in Ljubljana, is an interesting historical document which helps us complete the picture of the musical repertoire in Slovenia in the Reformation era and elucidates the problem of the stylistic orientation of the music of that period in Slovenia. In addition to this, it has a certain artistic value and so with some of its compositions it will make a contribution to our repertoire of old polyphonic music.",1969,Musicological Annual
Sequence analysis Prediction of the coupling specificity of GPCRs to four families of G-proteins using hidden Markov models and artificial neural networks,"Motivation:G-proteincoupled receptorsareamajorclassofeukaryotic cell-surface receptors. A very important aspect of their function is the specific interaction (coupling) with members of four G-protein families. A single GPCRmay interact with members of more than one G-protein families (promiscuous coupling). To date all published methods that predict the coupling specificity of GPCRs are restricted to three main coupling groupsGi/o, Gq/11 andGs, not includingG12/13-coupledor other promiscuous receptors. Results: We present a method that combines hidden Markov models and a feed-forward artificial neural network to overcome these limitations,while producing themost accuratepredictions currently available. Using an up-to-date curated dataset, our method yields a 94% correct classification rate in a 5-fold cross-validation test. The method predicts also promiscuous coupling preferences, including coupling to G12/13, whereas unlike other methods avoids overpredictions (false positives) when non-GPCR sequences are encountered.

Urban womens autonomy and natural fertility in the Sahel region of Africa.,The proximate determinants of fertility in 1983 and 1984 were examined among a sample of women from Boho-Dioulasso Burkina Faso (80 women) and Bamako Mali (80 women) divided equally between the age group 30 years with a child the same age (25-27 months old). The aim was to examine womens status their perceptions of and aspiration about fertility and family life their role as mothers and gender relations. Data were obtained from a panel survey on infant and child mortality known as EMIS that was initiated in 1981 with follow-ups every 24 months. The main ethnic group the Mossi and the other indigenous group the Bobo were equally interviewed in Bobo-Dioulasso. In Bamako the main group is the Bambara who were primarily interviewed with some additional representation among smaller ethnic groups. The discussion focused first on the priority determinants: the system of nuptiality womens age at marriage large age differences between the spouses and polygyny. The discussion continued with consideration of abstinence breast feeding and contraception (the ABC complex). The findings indicated that there was a very low age at marriage for women and social toleration of unwanted pregnancies before marriage. Marriage for women meant the shift from the authority of parents to the authority of spouses determined by the father of the bride. The preferred age at marriage among the Mossi was about 17 years but 15 and 19 years were acceptable. In Bamako women reported a desire for their daughters to marry at age 15 years and not later than 17 years. Age was not easily determined and fixed by age at marriage the age of spouses or age at first menstruation. In Bamako spousal age differences averaged 12.1 years and 62% of husbands were a minimum of 10 years older. Marriage for women becomes a separation from maternal kin and is the opportunity for motherhood. Young women have choices between school or marriage each with its drawbacks. Polgyny is common in both cities. In the original survey 48% were in polygynous unions; in this sample there were 60 out of 160 in polygynous unions. Polygyny as practiced has only one option for gaining status: reproduction. Polygyny does confer also some freedom because of the mixed households. Women may be free women when the union forms are nontraditional.,1993,
Xanthomoninsâ€…I-III: a new class of lasso peptides with a seven-residue macrolactam ring.,"Lasso peptides belong to the class of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides. Their common distinguishing feature is an N-terminal macrolactam ring that is threaded by the C-terminal tail. This lasso fold is maintained through steric interactions. The isolation and characterization of xanthomoninsâ€…I-III, the first lasso peptides featuring macrolactam rings consisting of only seven amino acids, is now presented. The crystal structure of xanthomoninâ€…I and the NMR structure of xanthomoninâ€…II were also determined. A total of 25 variants of xanthomoninâ€…II were generated to probe different aspects of the biosynthesis, stability, and fold maintenance. These mutational studies reveal the limits such a small ring imposes on the threading and show that every plug amino acid larger than serine is able to maintain a heat-stable lasso fold in the xanthomoninâ€…II scaffold.",2014,Angewandte Chemie
Isozymes of tropical seagrasses from the Indo-Pacific and the gulf of Mexico-Caribbean,"Abstract Seagrasses in the Gulf of Mexico-Caribbean have different isozymes from those of species in the same genera in the Indo-Pacific, but species populations of various origins within each ocean system show little isozyme variation. The populations of Thalassia, Syringodium and Halodule from the Gulf-Caribbean have a wide range of morphological and physiological variation under controlled conditions, but show no intraspecific isozyme differences. The same isozymes appear in populations of seven species within six genera ( Thalassia, Syringodium, Halodule, Cymodocea, Thalassodendron and Halophila ) from the Kenya coast of the Indian Ocean and from Micronesia in the western Pacific. The reported distribution of Halodule wrightii Aschers. in the Indian Ocean, based on vegetative characteristics, is not supported by isozyme data from plants. The lack of intraspecific isozyme variability within an ocean system may be related to electrophoretic bias, but the differentiation of isozymes in the plants from the two ocean systems suggests that these submerged marine angiosperms of the Potamogetonaceae and Hydrocharitaceae have diverged as a consequence of spatial isolation.",1980,Aquatic Botany

Between East and West: Experimental spaces in Brechtâ€™s theatre,"Nel suo teatro Brecht rappresenta luoghi â€œrealiâ€, immaginari o letterari, quasi sempre distanti nel tempo e nello spazio. Facendo riferimento ai concetti utilizzati da Deleuze nella definizione delle caratteristiche del cinema neorealista in contrasto con il cinema del vecchio realismo questo saggio si concentrera sull'analisi dei luoghi brechtiani come spazi vuoti o sconnessi, vale a dire come spazi sperimentali piuttosto che reali. Oriente e Occidente sono di fatto indistinguibili in questa geografia artificiale, che mette in scena elementi di rottura in un teatro che rimane legato all'azione, ma che, allo stesso tempo, mette in discussione l'idea di un'unita tra l'uomo e il mondo, cosi come il concetto dell'arte come riproduzione fotografica della realta. In questi spazi artificiali Brecht sperimenta anche con i suoi personaggi, nel tentativo di rappresentare le diverse articolazioni del rapporto tra individuo e collettivo: il concetto di Badiou di una soggettivita universale e utile, in questo contesto, per identificare una possibile evoluzione nel teatro di Brecht, la messa in scena di un momento di consapevolezza di alcuni dei suoi personaggi, come Frau Carrar e Pelagea Wlassowa.",2011,Between
LSC Abstract â€“ Early biomarkers indicating the development of neonatal chronic lung disease defined by clinical and imaging parameters,"Neonatal chronic lung disease, i.e. BPD determines long-term pulmonary and neurologic development. Early markers are urgently needed for timely diagnosis and personalized treatment. The prospective study determined structural and functional changes in the preterm lung at the time of diagnosis and identified early disease markers by proteome screening in plasma in the first week of life. 40 infants (27.7Â±2.09wks, 984Â±332g) were included for advanced MRI measurements (3-Tesla) and complemented by Infant Lung function testing (ILFT) in spontaneously breathing infants. Plasma samples were processed for proteomic screening by SOMAscanâ„¢. Key findings were confirmed in an independent study cohort (n=21 infants). Statistical analysis used penalized and Poisson regression analysis; for protein analysis confounder effects were subtracted by lasso regression. Statistical analysis confirmed a high correlation of MRI and lung function variables and identified a pattern characterizing changes in the lungs of preterm infants by T2- and T1-weighed image analysis and lung volume measurements as well as ILFT. Functional enrichment analysis showed overrepresentation of the GO categories 9immune function9, 9extracellular matrix9, 9cellular proliferation/migration9, 9organ development9 and 9angiogenesis9 in infants with BPD. One protein was identified as a potential biomarker. We identified a structural pattern characterizing BPD by advanced MRI confirmed by ILFT. The identified protein indicated BPD development in the first week of life enabling personalized treatment strategies.",2016,European Respiratory Journal
Bolasso: model consistent Lasso estimation through the bootstrap,"We consider the least-square linear regression problem with regularization by the l1-norm, a problem usually referred to as the Lasso. In this paper, we present a detailed asymptotic analysis of model consistency of the Lasso. For various decays of the regularization parameter, we compute asymptotic equivalents of the probability of correct model selection (i.e., variable selection). For a specific rate decay, we show that the Lasso selects all the variables that should enter the model with probability tending to one exponentially fast, while it selects all other variables with strictly positive probability. We show that this property implies that if we run the Lasso for several bootstrapped replications of a given sample, then intersecting the supports of the Lasso bootstrap estimates leads to consistent model selection. This novel variable selection algorithm, referred to as the Bolasso, is compared favorably to other linear regression methods on synthetic data and datasets from the UCI machine learning repository.",2008,
Descriptive Symbolic Models of Gaits from Parkinson's Disease Patients,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system that has many debilitating symptoms which affect the patient's motor system and can cause significant changes in their gait. By using genetic programming, we aim to develop descriptive symbolic nonlinear models of PD patient gait from time series data recorded from pressure sensors under subjects' feet. When compared to popular types of linear regression (OLS and LASSO), the nonlinear models fit their data better and generalize to unseen data significantly better. It was found that models developed for healthy control subjects generalized to other control subjects well, however the models trained on subjects with PD did not generalize well to other PD patients, which complicates the issue of being able to detect the progression of the disease. It is suspected that health care professionals can have difficulty classifying PD due to a lack of accurate data from patient reports; having individually trained models for active monitoring of patients would help in effectively diagnosing PD.",2019,2019 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (CIBCB)
Adopting Elastic Net Penalization in Logistic Regression to Achieve Stability : A Case Study of University of UMTHBorno State Nigeria,"In this work, study is made on those factors that raise the risk of diabetic patients to be hypertensive and the methods have been determined that best fit the data for modelling. The ordinary logistic regression model fitted turned up to be significant at 1% with a pvalue of 0.000. The significant covariates reveal that age increases the risk of being hypertensive for diabetic patient at 16% per unit change. Weight by 60%, marital status decreases it by 74%, exercising decreases it by 95% and family history also by 59%. Various levels of penalization are used for the elastic net logistic regression have shown reasonable improvement over the ordinary logistic regression, with lasso having least deviance ratio (0.52) but also shrinks eight covariates to zero. This is followed by elastic net with centred penalization, which behaves in a similar manner as lasso, but shrinks six of the covariates to zero (with a deviance ratio of 0.58). Ridge logistic regression and the fixed ridge logistic elastic net both retained all the covariates in the model with values of deviance ratio 0.6 and 0.65 respectively.",2014,
Predictive Analysis Tool for Predicting Student Performance and Placement Performance using ML algorithms.,"Recently, Predictive Analysis using machine learning and data science has had greater growth in almost every field. Predictive analysis for predicting student performance has always been difficult than other predictions such as House price prediction, stock market prediction, sales prediction, etc., Due to the difficulty in finding and collecting appropriate datasets, especially in college-level education. Since the grading system differs from universities to universities, it is even more difficult to collect proper datasets that can be used as a global dataset, created based on the system that is common to almost every university. In this paper, we have taken this difficult task and created a dataset, which contains student details of over 185 students. The dataset was collected from SRM Valliammai engineering college, it includes the data of 2018 and 2019 passed out students. Other than academic data, the dataset also covers other attributes of the students. The dataset contains around 20 attributes which would improve the accuracy score. Using this dataset our aim is to develop a training model that predicts the final CGPA of a student and also the placement result of the particular student. We have successfully predicted the studentâ€™s final CGPA and their placement result. We have predicted the results using algorithms like Linear Regression (LR1), Decision tree (DT) algorithm, K-nearest neighbor algorithm (KNN), Logistical regression (LR2) and Lasso regression (LR3) algorithm. And we have obtained excellent results with accuracy over 94%. The predicted results are obtained from comparing the accuracy score of the above-given algorithms. The one with the highest accuracy was displayed as the final output.",2020,International Journal of Advance Research and Innovative Ideas in Education

Drawing inferences for high-dimensional linear models: A selection-assisted partial regression and smoothing approach.,"Drawing inferences for high-dimensional models is challenging as regular asymptotic theories are not applicable. This article proposes a new framework of simultaneous estimation and inferences for high-dimensional linear models. By smoothing over partial regression estimates based on a given variable selection scheme, we reduce the problem to low-dimensional least squares estimations. The procedure, termed as Selection-assisted Partial Regression and Smoothing (SPARES), utilizes data splitting along with variable selection and partial regression. We show that the SPARES estimator is asymptotically unbiased and normal, and derive its variance via a nonparametric delta method. The utility of the procedure is evaluated under various simulation scenarios and via comparisons with the de-biased LASSO estimators, a major competitor. We apply the method to analyze two genomic datasets and obtain biologically meaningful results.",2018,Biometrics
Evidence for high genetic diversity and long-term endemicity of hepatitis C virus genotypes 1 and 2 in West Africa.,"During 1994 and 1995, the prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and its genotypes were studied in several rural and urban populations in three West African countries: Guinea, Burkina Faso, and Benin. The following groups were screened for antibodies to HCV (anti-HCV): 459 villagers in the forest region of Guinea; 965 individuals in urban, suburban, and rural populations of the Bobo Dioulasso area, Burkina Faso; and 582 blood donors in Cotonou, Benin. In Benin, 60 patients with sickle cell anemia (30 with and 30 without history of multiple transfusion) and 13 hospital patients with liver disease were also tested. RT-PCR detection of HCV-RNA was carried out on all anti-HCV positive samples, followed by genotyping and sequencing of unrecognized subtypes. The prevalence rates of anti-HCV were 1.1% in the Guinean population group, 1.4% among blood donors in Benin, and 4.9% in residents of Burkina Faso. In patients with sickle cell anemia, five of the 30 polytranfused patients (17%) had anti-HCV, whereas none of the patients without a history of blood transfusion had anti-HCV (P < 0.05). Among the 13 patients with liver disease, five had anti-HCV, of whom four had history of blood transfusion. HCV-RNA was detected in 41 anti-HCV positive sera. All belonged to genotypes 1 or 2, with a high genomic diversity; 18 different subtypes were identified, including 2c, 2d, and 16 new subtypes. Such genetic diversity poses a challenge for vaccine development and also implies that HCV infection is long-established in these West African regions.",1998,Journal of medical virology
Simultaneous Lasso and Dantzig Selector in High Dimensional Nonparametric Regression,"During the last few years, a great deal of attention has been focused on Lasso and Dantzig selector in high dimensional linear regression when the number of variables can be much larger than the sample size. Under a sparsity scenario, Bickel et al. (2009) showed that the Lasso estimator and the Dantzig selector exhibit similar behavior, and derived oracle inequalities for the prediction risk in the general nonparametric regression model, as well as bounds on the L_p estimation loss in the linear model. The Assumption RE (s,m,c) and Assumption RE (s,c) play a significant role in their paper. In this paper, the assumptions equivalent with Assumption RE and Assumption RE are given. More precise oracle inequalities for the prediction risk in the general nonparametric regression model and bounds on the L_p estimation loss in the linear model are derived when the number of variables can be much larger than the sample size.",2013,International journal of applied mathematics and statistics

Other concerns such as prediction accuracies and personalized regression are also discussed in the evaluation.",2013,Neurocomputing
Specifics of the distribution of commercial fishes in the northwestern Bering Sea,"Data of trawling censuses (1996â€“2005) are used to analyze the specifics of the distribution of commercial fishes present in the northwestern Bering Sea in summer and autumn and forming accumulations in the waters of the Olyutorsky-Navarin region. Areas with maximum fish density usually have a temperature range of 2.4â€“4.0Â°C in near-bottom water layers; they are observed in the same localities, with some interannual variation: in the middle shelf, with depths of 50â€“160 m southwest of Cape Navarin to Cape Khaiidin and between the Dezhneva Bay and Expeditsii Bay, and in waters of the continental slope adjacent to the first area, with depths over 270 m. The accumulations on the shelf mainly consist of such commercial species as the Alaska pollock Theragra chalcogramma, Pacific cod Gadus macrocephalus, saffron cod Eleginus gracilis, northern rock sole Lepidopsetta polyxystra, Alaska plaice Pleuronectes quadrituberculatus, and righteye flounders of the genus Hippoglossoides (H. robustus and H. elassodon); on the continental slope, they consist mainly of the Greenland halibut Reinhardtius hippoglossoides and Pacific halibut Hippoglossus stenolepis. The recorded density of fish in the Olyutorsky-Navarin region was the highest in 2004â€“2005 and the lowest in 1999, 2001, and 2002. This variation was determined mainly by the interannual variation in the fishing for cods (Gadidae), which reflected the emergence of abundant generations and migration activity in fishes of this family, as well as from differences in the efficiency of fishing gear. Fishing for many species can and should be performed simultaneously; special attention should be paid to the coastal areas of the Olyutorsky-Navarin region, where considerable fish resources (such as the saffron cod, Pacific halibut, and other righteye flounders) are present.",2014,Journal of Ichthyology
"Winning Models for GPA, Grit, and Layoff in the Fragile Families Challenge","In this paper, we discuss and analyze our approach to the Fragile Families Challenge. The challenge involved predicting six outcomes for 4,242 children from disadvantaged families from around the United States. The data consisted of over 12,000 features (covariates) about the children and their parents, schools, and overall environments from birth to age 9. Our approach relied primarily on existing data science techniques, including: (1) data preprocessing: elimination of low variance features, imputation of missing data, and construction of composite features; (2) feature selection through univariate Mutual Information and extraction of non-zero LASSO coefficients; (3) three machine learning models: Random Forest, Elastic Net, and Gradient-Boosted Trees; and finally (4) prediction aggregation according to performance. The top-performing submissions produced winning out-of-sample predictions for three outcomes: GPA, grit, and layoff. However, predictions were at most 20% better than a baseline that predicted the mean value of the training data of each outcome.",2018,arXiv: Applications

Genome-wide prediction of discrete traits using bayesian regressions and machine learning,"BackgroundGenomic selection has gained much attention and the main goal is to increase the predictive accuracy and the genetic gain in livestock using dense marker information. Most methods dealing with the large p (number of covariates) small n (number of observations) problem have dealt only with continuous traits, but there are many important traits in livestock that are recorded in a discrete fashion (e.g. pregnancy outcome, disease resistance). It is necessary to evaluate alternatives to analyze discrete traits in a genome-wide prediction context.MethodsThis study shows two threshold versions of Bayesian regressions (Bayes A and Bayesian LASSO) and two machine learning algorithms (boosting and random forest) to analyze discrete traits in a genome-wide prediction context. These methods were evaluated using simulated and field data to predict yet-to-be observed records. Performances were compared based on the models' predictive ability.ResultsThe simulation showed that machine learning had some advantages over Bayesian regressions when a small number of QTL regulated the trait under pure additivity. However, differences were small and disappeared with a large number of QTL. Bayesian threshold LASSO and boosting achieved the highest accuracies, whereas Random Forest presented the highest classification performance. Random Forest was the most consistent method in detecting resistant and susceptible animals, phi correlation was up to 81% greater than Bayesian regressions. Random Forest outperformed other methods in correctly classifying resistant and susceptible animals in the two pure swine lines evaluated. Boosting and Bayes A were more accurate with crossbred data.ConclusionsThe results of this study suggest that the best method for genome-wide prediction may depend on the genetic basis of the population analyzed. All methods were less accurate at correctly classifying intermediate animals than extreme animals. Among the different alternatives proposed to analyze discrete traits, machine-learning showed some advantages over Bayesian regressions. Boosting with a pseudo Huber loss function showed high accuracy, whereas Random Forest produced more consistent results and an interesting predictive ability. Nonetheless, the best method may be case-dependent and a initial evaluation of different methods is recommended to deal with a particular problem.",2010,"Genetics, Selection, Evolution : GSE"
