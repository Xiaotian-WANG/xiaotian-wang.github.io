Medicine Discrimination of NIRS Based on Regularized Collaborative Representation Classification with Gabor Optimizer,"Counterfeit medicine still exists widely, which have affected our health and life. So the discrimination (classification) of medicine is becoming more and more important. Then near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a popular and effective technique used on the medicine classification with nondestructive characteristics. To solve the discrimination of medicines, the sparse signal representation model is established in the presence of spectrum crossover and overlapping. However, the sparsity of nonzero representation coefficients is low during solving the \( L_{ 2} \)-norm on representation model. To overcome this problem, in this paper a novel classification modelâ€”regularized collaborative representation classification with Gabor optimizer (RCRCG) is proposed. Gabor filter is adopted to control the \( L_{2} \)-norm for the more relevant factor vectors. Then Lasso regulation on local classification is proved to improve the accuracy on the medicine discrimination. The experiments using NIRS samples from the three datasets (active substance, Erythromycin Ethylsuccinate and Domperidone) show that the proposed method is more effective and robust than the existing ones, and it has speed-up about 1 times compared with the Sparse Representation based Classification (SRC) and Class \( L_{1} \)-optimizer classifier with the closeness rule (C_CL1C).",2019,
"Environmental and correlative significance of a non-marine algal limestone (Westphalian D), Sydney Coalfield, Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia","The occurrence of an algal limestone containing stromatolites within the Morien Group (Sydney Coalfield) is reported for the first time. Three distinct morphologic forms of stromatolite (pinnacle, mat and detached) and their stratigraphic variation are described. Variation in clast type and size, biota and elements within the algal limestone is interpreted as evidence for the growth of stromatolites on the shore of an ephemeral, fresh to brackish lake, subject to fluctuating water levels. Pinnacle and mat forms developed on substrate irregularities. A bivalve and ostracode fauna in mudatones and siltstones above and below the algal limestone indicates a correlation with the Anthraconauta tenuis chronozone of Britain (Westphalian D) and corroborates on age derived from associated macro- and microflora.

Model-assisted calibration of non-probability sample survey data using adaptive LASSO,"The probability-sampling-based framework has dominated survey research because it provides precise mathematical tools to assess sampling variability. However increasing costs and declining response rates are expanding the use of non-probability samples, particularly in general population settings, where samples of individuals pulled from web surveys are becoming increasingly cheap and easy to access. But non-probability samples are at risk for selection bias due to differential access, degrees of interest, and other factors. Calibration to known statistical totals in the population provide a means of potentially diminishing the effect of selection bias in non-probability samples. Here we show that model calibration using adaptive LASSO can yield a consistent estimator of a population total as long as a subset of the true predictors is included in the prediction model, thus allowing large numbers of possible covariates to be included without risk of overfitting. We show that the model calibration using adaptive LASSO provides improved estimation with respect to mean square error relative to standard competitors such as generalized regression (GREG) estimators when a large number of covariates are required to determine the true model, with effectively no loss in efficiency over GREG when smaller models will suffice. We also derive closed form variance estimators of population totals, and compare their behavior with bootstrap estimators. We conclude with a real world example using data from the National Health Interview Survey.",2018,
Microbial community profiles grown on 1020 carbon steel surfaces in seawater-isolated microcosm,"Corrosion of metallic alloys is a concern worldwide, with impacts affecting different production sectors and consequent economic losses in the order of billions of dollars annually. Biocorrosion is a form of corrosion where the participation of microorganisms can induce, accelerate, or inhibit corrosive processes. In this study, it was evaluated that the changes in profile communities, by the sequencing of the 16S ribosomal gene, grown over steel coupons in a microcosm with no additional oxygen supplementation for 120 days. Analysis of abundance and diversity indices indicates marked changes in microbial structures throughout the 120-day period. Homology results of OTUs generated by Illumina sequencing indicated Proteobacteria phylum as the dominant group, comprising about 85.3% of the total OTUs, followed by Firmicutes and Bacteriodetes, both with 7.35%. Analyses at lower taxonomic levels suggested the presence of representatives described as corroders, such as Citreicella thiooxidans, Thalassospira sp., and Limnobacter thiooxidans. In conclusion, the results suggest that no additional oxygen supplementation profoundly altered the core of microbial communities, with a predominance of facultative anaerobic species.",2020,Annals of Microbiology

Traditionality of mating-site preferences in a coral reef fish,"Mating systems are often viewed as a result of females choosing where, when and with whom to mate1,2, and of male responses to female behaviour3,4. If the distribution of females reflects their response to vital resources for survival and reproduction, then a careful study of these resources should yield predictions about the emergent mating system. Males and females could, however, simply gather at traditional sites to mate5. If so, analysis of the current state of the environment may yield incorrect predictions about mating sites5â€“9. Mating sites of the bluehead wrasse Thalassoma bifasciatum have remained in daily use over 12 years (four generations) without changing locations. Here, I show that experimental replacement of entire local populations led to the use of new sites, which continued to be used after the manipulations. Thus mating site locations may not be the result of individual assessment of current resource quality, but instead represent culturally transmitted traditions. Attempts to explain mating patterns based on the distribution of resources should therefore be approached with caution.",1988,Nature
A New Frog of the Genus Eleutherodactylus from Western Panama,"Eleutherodactylus jota sp. nov. is named from Bocas del Toro province in western Panama. It is closely allied to E. bransfordii (with which it is sympatric) and E. podiciferus (found at higher altitudes) but readily differs from each in having folds along the forearm and tarsus, a calcar, and a short first toe, as well as in snout shape. In the course of searching for a Middle American representative of the discoidalis Group of Eleutherodactylus, I found a small sample of a distinctive Eleutherodactylus species from western Panama. Although superficially resembling E. dolops Lynch & Duellman, E. elassodiscus Lynch, E. mantipus (Boulenger), and E. nigrovittatus Anderson (the discoidalis Group representatives of northwestern South America), the Panamanian frogs have feebly areolate skin of the venter and a short first finger as do E. bransfordii (Cope) and E. podiciferus (Cope). All of these frogs have broad vomerine odontophores (Fig. 1C).

Clinical Pharmacogenetic Models of Treatment Response to Methotrexate Monotherapy in Slovenian and Serbian Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients: Differences in Patient's Management May Preclude Generalization of the Models,"Objectives: Methotrexate (MTX) is the first line treatment for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but nevertheless 30% of patients experience MTX inefficacy. Our aim was to develop a clinical pharmacogenetic model to predict which RA patients will not respond to MTX monotherapy. We also assessed whether this model can be generalized to other populations by validating it on a group of Serbian RA patients. Methods: In 110 RA Slovenian patients, data on clinical factors and 34 polymorphisms in MTX pathway were analyzed by Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) penalized regression to select variables associated with the disease activity as measured by Disease Activity Score (DAS28) score after 6 months of MTX monotherapy. A clinical pharmacogenetic index was constructed from penalized regression coefficients with absolute value above 0.05. This index was cross-validated and also independently validated on 133 Serbian RA patients. Results: A clinical pharmacogenetic index for prediction of DAS28 after 6 months of MTX monotherapy in Slovenian RA patients consisted of DAS28 score at diagnosis, presence of erosions, MTX dose, Solute Carrier Family 19 Member 1 (SLC19A1) rs1051266, Solute Carrier Organic Anion Transporter Family Member 1B1 (SLCO1B1) rs2306283, Thymidylate Synthase (TYMS), and Adenosine Monophosphate Deaminase 1 (AMPD1) rs17602729. It correctly classified 69% of Slovenian patients as responders or nonresponders and explained 30% of variability in DAS28 after 6 months of MTX monotherapy. Testing for validity in another population showed that it classified correctly only 22.5% of Serbian RA patients. Conclusions: We developed a clinical pharmacogenetic model for DAS28 after 6 months of MTX monotherapy in Slovenian RA patients by combining clinical and genetic variables. The clinical pharmacogenetic index developed for Slovenian patients did not perform well on Serbian patients, presumably due to the differences in patients' characteristics and clinical management between the two groups.",2018,Frontiers in Pharmacology
Genotype-immunophenotype analysis reveals the immunogenomic subtype and prognosis of multiple myeloma.,"Immune dysfunction plays an important role in tumour development, recurrence, therapeutic responses and overall survival. Multiple myeloma (MM) is a clonal B-cell malignancy which characterized by antitumoural immune dysfunction. In this study, we analyzed 28 tumour-immune-related pathways and calculated the immune pathway score through published microarray data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data portal. A training set of 345 patients and a validation set of 214 patients with primary MM were chosen. We performed least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) analysis to identify prognostic factors. Then we used cluster analysis to divide patients into three immunogenomic subtypes, which named abnormal immune activated type, common type and anti-myeloma immune activated type. Logâ€‘rank tests showed that anti-myeloma immune activated type had the best prognosis and abnormal immune activated type had the shortest overall survival (OS) (P=0.000) and event-free survival (EFS) (P=0.000). Multivariate Cox also indicated that the immunogenomic subtype was an independent predictor of OS (P=0.001) and EFS (P=0.000). We also analyzed the characteristics and the immune-response patterns of different subtypes. Then, we established a mathematical model to classify patients in the validation set. In the validation set, patients with different immunogenomic subtypes also had a significantly different OS (P=0.001) and EFS (P=0.005). Our study explored tumour-immune-related pathways at a multi-dimensional level and found the immunogenomic subtype of MM. Potential mechanisms on the genetic level of how tumour-immunity influences the prognosis and therapeutic responses are provided. The immunogenomic subtype may be feasible for deciding clinical treatment in the future.",2020,Carcinogenesis
Regularization Paths for Generalized Linear Models via Coordinate Descent.,"We develop fast algorithms for estimation of generalized linear models with convex penalties. The models include linear regression, two-class logistic regression, and multinomial regression problems while the penalties include â„“(1) (the lasso), â„“(2) (ridge regression) and mixtures of the two (the elastic net). The algorithms use cyclical coordinate descent, computed along a regularization path. The methods can handle large problems and can also deal efficiently with sparse features. In comparative timings we find that the new algorithms are considerably faster than competing methods.",2010,Journal of statistical software
Chemical Modification of Microcin J25 Reveals New Insights on the Stereospecific Requirements for Antimicrobial Activity,"In this study, microcin J25, a potent antimicrobial lasso peptide that acts on Gram-negative bacteria, was subjected to a harsh treatment with a base in order to interrogate its stability and mechanism of action and explore its structure-activity relationship. Despite the high stability reported for this lasso peptide, the chemical treatment led to the detection of a new product. Structural studies revealed that this product retained the lasso topology, but showed no antimicrobial activity due to the epimerization of a key residue for the activity. Further microbiological assays also demonstrated that it showed a high synergistic effect with colistin.",2019,International Journal of Molecular Sciences

Multiplex screening of 275 plasma protein biomarkers to identify a signature for early detection of colorectal cancer,"Blood-based protein biomarkers may be an attractive option for early detection of colorectal cancer (CRC). Here, we used a two-stage design to measure 275 protein markers by proximity extension assay (PEA), first in plasma samples of a discovery set consisting of 98 newly diagnosed CRC cases and 100 age and gender matched controls free of neoplasm at screening colonoscopy. An algorithm predicting the presence of early or late stage CRC was derived by Lasso regression with .632+ bootstrap method and the algorithms were then validated using PEA again in an independent validation set consisting of participants of screening colonoscopy with and without CRC (n= 56 and 102, respectively). Three different signatures for all, early, and late stages CRC consisting of 9, 12, and 11 protein markers were obtained in the discovery set with areas under the curves (AUCs) after .632+ bootstrap adjustment of 0.92, 0.91 and 0.96, respectively. External validation among participants of screening colonoscopy yielded AUCs of 0.76 (95%CI, 0.67-0.84), 0.75 (95%CI, 0.62-0.87) and 0.80 (95%CI, 0.68-0.89) for all, early, and late stage CRC, respectively. Although the identified protein markers are not competitive with the best available stool tests, these proteins may contribute to the development of powerful blood-based tests for CRC early detection in the future.",2019,Molecular Oncology
Using differential nonlinear gene co-expression network analysis for identification gastric cancer related genes,"Gastric cancer is one of the most common malignancies and ranks the second highest mortality in the world today. With this great progress, understanding of tumors is still a wide area to study. We utilized the distance correlation as the measurement of the relevance to construct the gene co-expression networks in both gastric cancer and normal tissue datasets respectively, also to define the complex interactions among genes with nonlinear property preserved and examine from the genes that have important roles in the gastric cancer formation. The genes which are extant in the module of normalassociated network but missing in the module of cancer-associated network are selected for further study and we call these genes stray genes. The results show the stray genes are enriched in up-regulation and the connectivity of all the genes appear the circumstance of loss in the gastric cancer network, especially to the stray genes. These results indicate that the activation of these stray genes may play important roles in the gastric cancer. We use PANTHER for Gene Ontology (GO) analysis and the results show that these stray genes are enriched in some biological processes, including cell cycle, chromosome segregation, DNA replication and p53 pathway and others. These results prove the effectiveness of our method for cancer-related genes identification and these cancer-related genes can be selected for further analysis.",2017,Biomedical Research-tokyo
Effects of temperature and biostimulation on oil-degrading microbial communities in temperate estuarine waters.,"Improved strategies for oil-spill remediation will follow a better understanding of the nature, activities and regulating parameters of petroleum hydrocarbon-degrading microbial communities in temperate marine environments. The addition of crude oil to estuarine water resulted in an immediate change in bacterial community structure, increased abundance of hydrocarbon-degrading microorganisms and a rapid rate of oil degradation, suggesting the presence of a pre-adapted oil-degrading microbial community and sufficient supply of nutrients. Relatively rapid degradation was found at 4 degrees C, the lowest temperature tested; and it was temperature rather than nutrient addition that most influenced the community structure. A detailed phylogenetic analysis of oil-degrading microcosms showed that known hydrocarbonoclastic organisms like Thalassolituus and Cycloclasticus, as well as proposed oil degraders like Roseobacter, were present at both 4 degrees C and 20 degrees C, demonstrating the thermo-versatility of such organisms. Clones related to Oleispira antarctica (98% 16S rRNA similarity), a psychrophilic alkane degrader, were dominant in the 4 degrees C oil-degrading community, whereas other clones constituting a different clade and showing 94% similarity 16S rRNA with O. antarctica were found in situ. These findings demonstrate the potential for intrinsic bioremediation throughout the course of the year in temperate estuarine waters, and highlight the importance of both versatile psychrotolerant and specialized psychrophilic hydrocarbon-degrading microbes in effecting this process at low temperatures.",2007,Environmental microbiology

"Free and Particle-associated Extracellular Enzyme Activity and Bacterial Production in the Lower Elbe Estuary, Germany","A high abundance of particles and aggregates is a characteristic of estuaries and may represent important loci of increased bioproductivity and microbial activity. From a survey performed in the Elbe estuary, particle concentration (using a particle counter), bacterial biomass and abundance (AODC method), bacterial production rates ([3H] thymidine method) and the microbial extracellular enzyme activity of 11 enzymes (MUF and MCA method) were determined with particular respect to their relationship to particles and aggregates (sizefractionated). Although higher particle abundance was found compared to other sections of the river Elbe, neither relative nor absolute bacterial activity associated with particles and aggregates was enhanced. The activity of free dissolved microbial enzymes was found to dominate the breakdown of organic material. The productivity of free dispersed bacteria â‰¥0.2â€¦ 10 Î¼m (0â€¦40%). This indicates that the larger particles and aggregates do not always contribute substantially to the overall microbial activity in rivers and estuaries.

Regression Networks for Robust Win-Rates Predictions of AI Gaming Bots,"Designing a robust and adaptable Artificial Intelligence (AI) opponent in a computer game would ensure the game continues to challenge, immerse and excite the players at any stage. The outcomes of card based games such as â€œHeartstone: Heroes of Warcraftâ€, aside the player skills, heavily depend on the initial composition of player card decks. To evaluate this impact we have developed a new robust regression network in a context of the AAIA Data Mining Competition 2018, which tries to predict the average win-rates of the specific combinations of bot-player and card decks. Our network is composed of 2 levels: the entry level with an array of finely optimized state of the art regression models including Extreme Learning Machines (ELM), Extreme Gradient Boosted decision tree (XGBOOST), and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression trained via supervised learning on the labeled training dataset; and just a single ELM at the 2nd level installed to learn to correct the predictions from the 1st level. The final solution received the root of the mean squared error (RMSE) of just 5.65% and scored the 2nd place in AAIA'2018 competition. This paper also presents two other runner-up models receiving RMSE of 5.7% and 5.86%, scoring the 4th and the 6th place respectively.",2018,2018 Federated Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems (FedCSIS)
Information diffusion network inferring and pathway tracking,"AbstractNetwork diffusion, such as spread of ideas, rumors, contagious disease, or a new type of behaviors, is one of the fundamental processes within networks. Designing effective strategies for influence spread maximization, rumor spread minimization, or epidemic immunization has attracted considerable research attention. However, a key challenge is that many times we can only observe the trace of contagion spreading across network, but the underlying network structure is unknown and the transmission rates between node pairs are unclear to us. In this paper, given the observed information cascades, we aim to address two problems: diffusion network structure inferring and information diffusion pathways tracking. We propose a novel probabilistic model called Network Inferring from Multidimensional Features of Cascades (NIMFC) which takes into account heterogeneous features, including temporal and topological features of cascades, node attributes, and information content, to infer the latent network structure and transmission rates of edges. Also, based on the inferred network structure, we may track diffusion pathways of a cascade in social networks. We use blocked coordinate descent method to learn a sparse estimation of the latent network. Our proposed model NIMFC is evaluated both on large synthetic and real-world data sets, and experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models both in terms of recovering the latent network structure and information pathway tracking.æŠ½è±¡åˆ›æ–°ç‚¹è¿‘å‡ å¹´æ¥, éšç€äº’è”ç½‘çš„å¿«é€Ÿå‘å±•, åœ¨çº¿ç¤¾äº¤ç½‘ç»œä¸­çš„ä¿¡æ¯ä¼ æ’­è¶Šæ¥è¶Šæ™®é, åŒ…æ‹¬çƒ­ç‚¹è¯é¢˜ä¼ æ’­, è§‚ç‚¹ä¼ æ’­, è°£è¨€ä¼ æ’­, è´­ä¹°è¡Œä¸ºæˆ–æµè¡Œæ—¶å°šçš„ä¼ æ’­ç­‰ç­‰. ä¸Žç½‘ç»œä¼ æ’­è¡Œä¸ºç›¸å…³çš„ç ”ç©¶è¯é¢˜, åŒ…æ‹¬å½±å“åŠ›ä¼ æ’­æœ€å¤§åŒ–, æ„è§é¢†è¢–æŒ–æŽ˜, è¯é¢˜å‘çŽ°å’Œè·Ÿè¸ª, äº‹ä»¶çˆ†å‘æ£€æµ‹ç­‰, æ­£å¸å¼•ç€è¶Šæ¥è¶Šå¤šçš„ç ”ç©¶å…´è¶£.è¿™äº›ç ”ç©¶æ‰€é¢ä¸´çš„ä¸€ä¸ªå…±åŒæŒ‘æˆ˜æ˜¯, å¾ˆå¤šæ—¶å€™æˆ‘ä»¬åªèƒ½è§‚å¯Ÿåˆ°ç½‘ç»œä¸­çš„ä¼ æ’­çŽ°è±¡, ä¹Ÿå³ä¸åŒèŠ‚ç‚¹åœ¨ä¸åŒæ—¶é—´ â€œæ„ŸæŸ“â€ äº†ç›®æ ‡ â€œä¼ æŸ“æºâ€, å´ä¸çŸ¥é“æ½œåœ¨çš„ç½‘ç»œç»“æž„, ä»¥åŠç½‘ç»œä¸­ç»“ç‚¹ä¹‹é—´çš„ä¼ æ’­é€ŸçŽ‡.æˆ‘ä»¬å°†ä¿¡æ¯åœ¨ç½‘ç»œä¸­ä¼ æ’­æ—¶æ‰€ç•™ä¸‹çš„æ—¶ç©ºè½¨è¿¹ç§°ä¸ºä¼ æ’­çº§è”. æœ¬æ–‡åŸºäºŽä¿¡æ¯ä¼ æ’­çº§è”æ•°æ®ä¸»è¦ç ”ç©¶ä¸¤æ–¹é¢çš„é—®é¢˜, åˆ†åˆ«æ˜¯ä¼ æ’­ç½‘ç»œç»“æž„æŽ¨æ–­å’Œä¿¡æ¯ä¼ æ’­è·¯å¾„è·Ÿè¸ª.æœ¬æ–‡æå‡ºäº†ä¸€ä¸ªåŸºäºŽä¿¡æ¯çº§è”å¤šç»´ç‰¹å¾èžåˆçš„ç½‘ç»œæŽ¨æ–­ç®—æ³• (NIMFC), è¯¥ç®—æ³•èžåˆäº†å¤šç»´å¼‚æž„ç‰¹å¾, åŒ…æ‹¬ä¿¡æ¯çº§è”çš„æ—¶åºå’Œæ‹“æ‰‘ç‰¹å¾, èŠ‚ç‚¹å±žæ€§, ä¿¡æ¯å†…å®¹, æ¥æŽ¨æ–­æ½œåœ¨ç½‘ç»œç»“æž„, ä»¥åŠèŠ‚ç‚¹ä¹‹é—´çš„ä¼ æ’­é€ŸçŽ‡. å¦å¤–, è¯¥ç®—æ³•è¿˜å¯ä»¥åŸºäºŽå·²æŽ¨æ–­çš„ç½‘ç»œç»“æž„, è¿›ä¸€æ­¥æŽ¨æ–­ä¿¡æ¯åœ¨è¿‡åŽ»æ—¶é—´é‡Œçš„ä¼ æ’­è·¯å¾„.æœ€åŽ, ä¸ºäº†éªŒè¯ç®—æ³•çš„æ•ˆæžœå’Œæ€§èƒ½, æˆ‘ä»¬åœ¨äººå·¥åˆæˆæ•°æ®é›†å’Œæ–°æµªå¾®åšçœŸå®žæ•°æ®é›†ä¸Šè¿›è¡Œäº†å®žéªŒ, ç»“æžœè¡¨æ˜Žåœ¨ç½‘ç»œç»“æž„æŽ¨æ–­å’Œä¿¡æ¯ä¼ æ’­è·¯å¾„è·Ÿè¸ªå‡†ç¡®çŽ‡ä¸¤ä¸ªæ–¹é¢, NIMFC ç®—æ³•å‡ä¼˜äºŽåŒç±»ç®—æ³•.

SOR-Half threshold algorithms based on the sparse index tracking model,"In a recent study of the sparse model,the nonconvex regularization method especially Half threshold algorithm based on L_(1/2)regularization is proved to an effective algorithm,because it can not only obtain the good sparsity,but also fast converges to some a feasible solution of L_(1/2)regularization.In this article,the Half threshold algorithm is improved to propose the successive over relaxation Half(SOR-Half)threshold algorithm and symmetric successive over relaxation Half(SSOR-Half)threshold algorithm.At the same time,the two algorithms are used to solve sparse index tracking problem under the condition of the budget and short limitation.Numerical experiments show that these two kinds of algorithm in solving sparse index tracking problem are more efficient than Half threshold algorithm and LASSO algorithm.",2015,Basic Sciences Journal of Textile Universities
Asymmetric volatility spillovers between UK regional worker flows and vacancies,"This paper investigates volatility spillovers between UK regional job finding, job separation and vacancy rates. Employing a logistic smooth transition vector autoregression (VAR) to model the large nonlinear dynamic system, we use the methods of Diebold and Yilmaz (2012) to decompose the forecast error variances. Our approach is Bayesian. More specifically, we extend doubly adaptive elastic-net Lasso (DAELasso) methods for VAR parameter shrinkage into a nonlinear framework to allow for the possible regime changes. We find that for each variable, both the volatility spillovers to and from other variables are high, providing clear evidence for the close interdependence between UK regional labour markets. The pivotal role of London in generating and spreading changes in volatility is highlighted. Analysis of net spillovers shows that, in general, shocks to job separation rates tend to spread into job finding and vacancy rates. By contrast, vacancy rates are usually at the receiving ends of shocks transmitted from the job separation and finding rates. We further examine the shock propagation mechanism in more detail, such as the differences in spillovers between regions within the same regime, and that of the same region but in different regimes. Finally, we draw inferences that are of economic and policy importance.",2017,Applied Economics
Genomics and Prognosis Analysis of Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition in Glioma,"Background: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is regulated by induction factors, transcription factor families and an array of signaling pathways genes, and has been implicated in the invasion and progression of gliomas. Methods: We obtained the Clinicopathological data sets from Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA). The â€œlimmaâ€ package was used to analyze the expression of EMT-related genes in gliomas with different pathological characteristics. We used the â€œConsensusClusterPlusâ€ package to divide gliomas into two groups to study their correlation with glioma malignancy. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression was applied to select seven prognosis-associated genes to build the risk signature, and the coefficients obtained from the LASSO algorithm were used to calculate the risk score which we applied to determine the prognostic value of the risk signature. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to determine whether the risk signature is an independent prognostic indicator. Results: We analyzed the differentially expressed 22 common epithelial-mesenchymal transition-associated genes in 508 gliomas graded by different clinicopathological features. Two glioma subgroups (EM1/2) were identified by consistent clustering of the proteins, of which the EM1 subgroup had a better prognosis than the EM2 subgroup, and the EM2 group was associated with cancer migration and proliferation. Significant enrichment analysis revealed that EMT-related transcriptional regulators and signaling pathways genes were highly related to glioma malignancies. Seven EMT-related genes were used to derive risk scores, which served as independent prognostic markers and prediction factors for the clinicopathological features of glioma. And we found the overall survival (OS) was significantly different between the low- and high-risk groups, the ROC curve indicated that the risk score can predict survival rates for glioma patients. Conclusion: EMT-related induction factors, transcriptional regulators and signaling pathways genes are important players in the malignant progression of glioma and may help in decision making regarding the choice of prognosis assessment and provide us clues to understand EMT epigenetic modification in glioma.",2020,Frontiers in Oncology
Tradition and Change in Language and Discourse: Three Case Studies,"Abstract. The linguistic gumbo presented in this work is three separate sociolinguistic situations--Francoproven[??]al in Europe, Patron Saints' festivals in Central Mexico, and Kuna in Panama. Although each is distinct, all share certain sociolinguistic and discourse changes which raise interesting questions for the communities themselves, as well as for scholars such as ourselves. Introduction. It is an honor and a pleasure to have been invited to make this presentation at LASSO, and thus to be among friends and colleagues, present and former students. I remember with pleasure the various LASSO meetings I have attended. One way back involved a panel on the Mayan Kekchi language that was organized by Sandra Pinkerton and emerged from a field-methods class at UT Austin. I was a plenary speaker in El Paso where I talked about paying serious attention to documentation of language use, which means recording, transcribing, translating, and most recently electronic and web based archiving. Then I helped organize our annual meeting in Austin. In Puebla, Mexico, at that wonderful meeting, I had opportunity to present some of my work leading to my current activities. Today I have chosen to talk about three sociolinguistic situations which I have been researching lately--Francoproven[??]al in the Alpine regions of France, Italy, and Switzerland; Patron saint fiestas in Central Mexico; and discourse among the Kuna Indians of Panama, the work I am probably best known for. While quite different from one another, they all share certain sociolinguistic and discourse changes which raise interesting questions for the communities themselves, as well as for scholars such as ourselves. I have chosen this topic, with the juxtaposition of places, because of the very appropriate name given to this meeting in New Orleans: linguistic gumbo. The origin of the word GUMBO and its referent, a soup, is African. In the Americas gumbo is found in Creole contexts like New Orleans. Gumbo is a mix of ingredients which do not quite mix completely and thoroughly, and therein lies its pleasure. My linguistic gumbo is a mix of ingredients in several senses. First, each of these places in my work presented here is a sociolinguistic mix of ingredients. Second, my juxtaposing them here is another ingredient in the mix. And third, my own involvement in each place, especially among the Kuna recently, provides still another ingredient to the overall mix. Francoproven[??]al. Francoproven[??]al, an offshoot of the Gallo Romance branch of Romance languages, is a cluster of dialects and maybe languages, spoken in an Alpine region surrounding Mont Blanc in three countries--France, Switzerland, and Italy. It is called by various names including Patois, Savoyard, Dauphinois (in France); Fribourgeois, Valaisan (in Switzerland); and Patou[??], Vald[??]tain (in Italy). It is a minority language in each of the three countries. It is most moribund in France and Switzerland and most robust in Italy, especially in the various mountain valleys of the Val d'Aosta where it is still spoken fluently by people of all ages. Very few Francoproven[??]al speakers, if any, are monolingual. It is one of many European Romance languages, such as Proven[??]al, Catalan, Sicilian, and Neapolitan, that are still spoken in Europe but are not the official languages of the nation states in which they are spoken. Francoproven[??]al is the only Romance language spoken in three different European countries. The sociolinguistic situation of Francoproven[??]al typical of minority and endangered languages in Europe manifests unique features according to the country in which it is spoken. In France, which has been actively trying to eliminate minority languages since before the revolution, the national government has exerted tremendous pressure through compulsory education and the media for a monolingual, French speaking nation. It is remarkable that in spite of this pressure, linguistic diversity still exists. â€¦",2006,Southwest Journal of Linguistics

An adaptive penalty multi-pitch estimator with self-regularization,"This work treats multi-pitch estimation, and in particular the common misclassification issue wherein the pitch at half the true fundamental frequency, the sub-octave, is chosen instead of the true pitch. Extending on current group LASSO-based methods for pitch estimation, this work introduces an adaptive total variation penalty, which enforces both group- and block sparsity, as well as deals with errors due to sub-octaves. Also presented is a scheme for signal adaptive dictionary construction and automatic selection of the regularization parameters. Used together with this scheme, the proposed method is shown to yield accurate pitch estimates when evaluated on synthetic speech data. The method is shown to perform as good as, or better than, current state-of-the-art sparse methods while requiring fewer tuning parameters than these, as well as several conventional pitch estimation methods, even when these are given oracle model orders. When evaluated on a set of ten musical pieces, the method shows promising results for separating multi-pitch signals. HighlightsWe propose a multi-pitch estimator based on a regularized least-squares' problem.The method automatically estimates the number of sources and their model orders.The proposed method incorporates a signal adaptive self-regularization scheme.The proposed method is shown to yield accurate pitch frequency estimates.",2016,Signal Process.
Sparse Nonstationary Gabor Expansions - with Applications to Music Signals,"We present a new method for performing nonlinear approximation with redundant dictionaries. The method constructs an mâˆ’term approximation of the signal by thresholding with respect to a weighted version of its canonical expansion coefficients, thereby accounting for dependency between the coefficients. The main result is an associated strong Jackson embedding, which provides an upper bound on the corresponding reconstruction error. To complement the theoretical results, we compare the proposed method to the pure greedy method and the Windowed-Group Lasso by denoising music signals with elements from a Gabor dictionary.",2018,
Using Modified Clavien-Dindo's Classification System for Reporting Postoperative Complications of Transvesical Prostatectomy at Souro Sanou University Teaching Hospital of Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina-Faso),Aims: The aim of this study was to evaluate the postoperative complications using a standardized classification; modified Clavienâ€™s classification. Patients and methods: We have included all patients aged at least 50-years-old on the day of surgery between the 1st June 2015 and 31st May 2017 at the urology division of Souro Sanou University Teaching Hospital of Bobo-Dioulasso. Complications reports were performed according to the modified Clavien-Dindo system. Results: Hundred patients (100) presenting a complication after BPH surgery were included in this study in a total of 312 open prostatectomies performed. The postoperative complication rate was 32%. Seventy percent of the patients had at least one complication. Grade I and Grade II complications according to the modified Clavienâ€™s classification system were the most represented (87%). Two patients (2) died in the immediate postoperative period (Grade V). The presence of urethral catheter before surgery was identified as a risk factor for complication. A statistically significant difference was found in the group ICC Ëƒ 2 (Charlson Index of Comorbidity) for age parameter in the occurrence of complication. Conclusions: Open prostatectomy is associated with high morbidity in subjects with urinary catheters prior to surgery. Grade I and Grade II according to the modified Clavienâ€™s classification system were the most reported.,2019,

Chick survival in relation to nest site: is the Antarctic petrel hiding from its predator?,"In birds, the characteristics of the nest site may affect reproductive success. We found that shelter is an important characteristic of the Antarctic petrel (Thalassoica antarctica) nests because shelter prevents chick predation. However, the benefit of shelter was countervailed by melt water which mainly entered well-sheltered nests. Chick survival was monitored until the chick was left unattended for the first time. Late-hatched chicks had a higher survival probability than early-hatched chicks, possibly because late hatchers swamp the predator, the south polar skua (Catharacta maccormicki). Poorly sheltered nests tended to be occupied by parents with low body mass and late-hatched eggs. The results suggest that both shelter per se and parental characteristics may explain the relationship between predation risk and shelter. We need experiments to study the influence of nest site on reproductive success, and we need to map the frequency of melt water as a cause of reproductive failure.",2004,Polar Biology

"Benefits of Thalassotherapy with Sleep Management on Mood States and Well-being, and Cognitive and Physical Capacities in Healthy Workers","Objective: Thalassotherapy, which combines seawater hydrotherapy and the marine climate, improves mood, fatigue, general well-being, and physical capacities in the working population, but little is known on the interest to add sleep management to cares. We investigated effects of three days of thalassotherapy cares combined with sleep management on psychological and physical capacities using subjective and objective tests in healthy workers. Methods: Cares were undertaken in the morning after tests (10:15-12:15) and in the afternoon (14:15-16:15). Participants were asked to go to sleep from 22:30 to 07:00. Tests were performed at 09:00 before arriving to the resort (T0), the day after arrival (T1), the days following cares (T2, T3, T4), the day after week-end at home (T5) and after three days working (T6). Results: Polysomnographic sleep analysis showed that Total Sleep Time was significantly higher (+6%) the second night compared to the first, indicating an immediate positive effect of hydrotherapy cares. Self-reported mood states and health outcomes scores were improved at T2 in comparison with T1 (-67% for total mood disturbances, -17% for anxiety, -71% for fatigue, +23% for general well-being), as was daytime sleepiness (-26%). The number of lapses in the Psychomotor Vigilance Test (as objective marker of sustained attention) was significantly lower (-59%) at T2 compared to T1, whereas a delayed increase of lower limb flexibility was observed at T4 compared to T1 (+38%). Conclusion: Three days of thalassotherapy combined to sleep management have immediate beneficial effects on self-reported mood states, anxiety, fatigue, well-being and daytime sleepiness, as well as on the objective evaluation of sustained attention, in healthy workers. Beneficial effects on lower limb flexibility are observed after 3 days of cares. Positive effects were still observed after the weekend back home and after 3 days of return to work.",2018,Journal of sleep disorders and therapy
Futurism and Ultraism: Identity and Hybridity in the Spanish Avant-garde,"Abstract This essay argues for an interpretation of Ultraism as a case of hybridity that incorporated disparate avant-garde tendencies - Cubism, Futurism, Dadaism and Expressionism - in order to overcome the preceding modernista tradition. Although this vanguard movement never acquired a privileged position within European experimentalism, it possessed a thriving history in Latin America, where it took roots in the main capitals - Buenos Aires, Montevideo, Caracas, Santiago - and adopted new forms thanks to the efforts of Jorge Luis Borges and Guillermo de Torre. Particularly influenced by Futurist typography, the ultraÃ­stas utilized the potentialities of manifestos, articles and poems to bring about direct and immediate effects. This essay examines a series of poems by Guillermo de Torre, Xavier Boveda, Rafael Lasso de la Vega, Jorge Luis Borges and Volt in order to reflect on avant-garde cross-fertilizations and the impact of pictorial images on poetic language. Along these lines, the Spanish episode of Jorge Luis Borges and Norah Borges is a model case of artistic cross-disciplinarity. In an ekphrastic gesture, Norah Borges translated her brotherâ€™s prism aesthetics into plastic forms and, reciprocally, Jorge Luis Borges wrote poems based on his sisterâ€™s figurative art. Refusing to be confined to an isolated stance, Ultraism partook of migratory movements and exchanges, furthering extremely fertile alignments that conditioned its hybrid identity.",2013,
Model selection for factorial Gaussian graphical models with an application to dynamic regulatory networks,"Abstract Factorial Gaussian graphical Models (fGGMs) have recently been proposed for inferring dynamic gene regulatory networks from genomic high-throughput data. In the search for true regulatory relationships amongst the vast space of possible networks, these models allow the imposition of certain restrictions on the dynamic nature of these relationships, such as Markov dependencies of low order â€“ some entries of the precision matrix are a priori zeros â€“ or equal dependency strengths across time lags â€“ some entries of the precision matrix are assumed to be equal. The precision matrix is then estimated by l1-penalized maximum likelihood, imposing a further constraint on the absolute value of its entries, which results in sparse networks. Selecting the optimal sparsity level is a major challenge for this type of approaches. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of a number of model selection criteria for fGGMs by means of two simulated regulatory networks from realistic biological processes. The analysis reveals a good performance of fGGMs in comparison with other methods for inferring dynamic networks and of the KLCV criterion in particular for model selection. Finally, we present an application on a high-resolution time-course microarray data from the Neisseria meningitidis bacterium, a causative agent of life-threatening infections such as meningitis. The methodology described in this paper is implemented in the R package sglasso, freely available at CRAN, http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sglasso.",2016,Statistical Applications in Genetics and Molecular Biology

We extract node-based, multi-scale features which describe the propagation of heat over 'time' which not only inform the importance of a node in the graph, but also incorporate local and global information of the underlying geometry of the network. As a proof-of-concept, we test the efficacy of two heat kernel features for discriminating between motor and working memory functional networks from the Human Connectome Project. For comparison, we also classified task networks using traditional network metrics which similarly provide rankings of node importance. In addition, a variant of the Smooth Incremental Graphical Lasso Estimation algorithm was used to estimate non-sparse, precision matrices to account for non-stationarity in the time series. We illustrate differences in heat kernel features between tasks, and also between regions of the brain. Using a random forest classifier, we showed heat kernel metrics to capture intrinsic properties of functional networks that serve well as features for task classification.",2016,2016 International Workshop on Pattern Recognition in Neuroimaging (PRNI)
Taking Advantage of Sparsity in Multi-Task Learning,"We study the problem of estimating multiple linear regression equations for the purpose of both prediction and variable selection. Following recent work on multi-task learning Argyriou et al. [2008], we assume that the regression vectors share the same sparsity pattern. This means that the set of relevant predictor variables is the same across the different equations. This assumption leads us to consider the Group Lasso as a candidate estimation method. We show that this estimator enjoys nice sparsity oracle inequalities and variable selection properties. The results hold under a certain restricted eigenvalue condition and a coherence condition on the design matrix, which naturally extend recent work in Bickel et al. [2007], Lounici [2008]. In particular, in the multi-task learning scenario, in which the number of tasks can grow, we are able to remove completely the effect of the number of predictor variables in the bounds. Finally, we show how our results can be extended to more general noise distributions, of which we only require the variance to be finite.",2009,arXiv: Machine Learning

Predictive value of single-nucleotide polymorphism signature for recurrence in localised renal cell carcinoma: a retrospective analysis and multicentre validation study.,"BACKGROUND
Identification of high-risk localised renal cell carcinoma is key for the selection of patients for adjuvant treatment who are at truly higher risk of reccurrence. We developed a classifier based on single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to improve the predictive accuracy for renal cell carcinoma recurrence and investigated whether intratumour heterogeneity affected the precision of the classifier.


METHODS
In this retrospective analysis and multicentre validation study, we used paraffin-embedded specimens from the training set of 227 patients from Sun Yat-sen University (Guangzhou, Guangdong, China) with localised clear cell renal cell carcinoma to examine 44 potential recurrence-associated SNPs, which were identified by exploratory bioinformatics analyses of a genome-wide association study from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (KIRC) dataset (n=114, 906â€ˆ600 SNPs). We developed a six-SNP-based classifier by use of LASSO Cox regression, based on the association between SNP status and patients' recurrence-free survival. Intratumour heterogeneity was investigated from two other regions within the same tumours in the training set. The six-SNP-based classifier was validated in the internal testing set (n=226), the independent validation set (Chinese multicentre study; 428 patients treated between Jan 1, 2004 and Dec 31, 2012, at three hospitals in China), and TCGA set (441 retrospectively identified patients who underwent resection between 1998 and 2010 for localised clear cell renal cell carcinoma in the USA). The main outcome was recurrence-free survival; the secondary outcome was overall survival.


FINDINGS
Although intratumour heterogeneity was found in 48 (23%) of 206 cases in the internal testing set with complete SNP information, the predictive accuracy of the six-SNP-based classifier was similar in the three different regions of the training set (areas under the curve [AUC] at 5 years: 0Â·749 [95% CI 0Â·660-0Â·826] in region 1, 0Â·734 [0Â·651-0Â·814] in region 2, and 0Â·736 [0Â·649-0Â·824] in region 3). The six-SNP-based classifier precisely predicted recurrence-free survival of patients in three validation sets (hazard ratio [HR] 5Â·32 [95% CI 2Â·81-10Â·07] in the internal testing set, 5Â·39 [3Â·38-8Â·59] in the independent validation set, and 4Â·62 [2Â·48-8Â·61] in the TCGA set; all p<0Â·0001), independently of patient age or sex and tumour stage, grade, or necrosis. The classifier and the clinicopathological risk factors (tumour stage, grade, and necrosis) were combined to construct a nomogram, which had a predictive accuracy significantly higher than that of each variable alone (AUC at 5 years 0Â·811 [95% CI 0Â·756-0Â·861]).


INTERPRETATION
Our six-SNP-based classifier could be a practical and reliable predictor that can complement the existing staging system for prediction of localised renal cell carcinoma recurrence after surgery, which might enable physicians to make more informed treatment decisions about adjuvant therapy. Intratumour heterogeneity does not seem to hamper the accuracy of the six-SNP-based classifier as a reliable predictor of recurrence. The classifier has the potential to guide treatment decisions for patients at differing risks of recurrence.

Row Method of Sugar Beet (beta Vulgaris L.) Fertilization with Multicomponent Fertilizer Based on Urea-ammonium Nitrate Solution as a Way to Increase Nitrogen Efficiency,"Sugar beet is the main crop commonly cultivated for sugar production in temperate regions of the World. Actual yields in main Central Europe producing countries are much lower, due to many limiting factors. Among them, nutrients supply is of great value, especially referring to efficiency of nitrogen, which is generally low. In the conducted study two methods of nitrogen application were compared (i) broadcast of calcium saltpeter and (ii) row application of the multicomponent fertilizer based on urea-ammonium-nitrate (UAN) solution. The basic amount of the applied N was 75 kg ha-1. The highest yields of both taproots and refined sugar were harvested on the plot receiving 75 kg N-1 as UAN liquid multicomponent fertilizer and 50% of the recommended P and K rates. The positive effects of row application of liquid N fertilizer on taproot and sugar yields were also corroborated by high values of indices of agronomic efficiency for both N as well as P and K. However this method of sugar beets fertilization has some possibilities, as indicated by still high contents of melassogenic substances.",2010,Journal of Central European Agriculture

Bayesian lasso for random intercept factor model,"Structural Equation Models (SEM) are often used in psychological research. In many studies, determining the number of variables is di cult because maximum likelihood estimates are empirically under-identi ed when more factors are estimated in the model than are present in the data. In this study, the Random Intercept factor model is considered as a psychometric measurement model which, although useful in many research contexts, does not assume simple structure. We compare the RIF model to other factor models using Bayesian estimation to determine the dimensionality of the data as well as to investigate other psychometric measurement models for the data. The Bayesian Lasso method is explored as an e cient approach which estimates the parameters of the model and adjudicates model selection simultaneously. In an examination of both simulated and empirical data ML SEM's were empirically underidenti ed for overcomplex measurement models. Both conjugate Bayesian approaches and the Bayesian Lasso (BLasso) were found to yield superior estimates of parameters and consistently agreed upon the same measurement model for the data. Taken together, the results suggest that Bayesian approaches are preferable to ML for selection of an appropriate psychometric measurement model for the data. Of the two Bayesian approaches, the BLasso may be preferred given that it does not require speci cation and model comparison of the several types of measurement models considered.",2013,Submitted by the University of Missouri--Columbia Graduate School
â€˜Our Clownâ€™: European Memory and Sentimental Nationality in Charlie Rivel's Unexpected Itinerary,"AbstractThis article traces the unexpected itinerary of Catalan-born circus artist Charlie Rivel [nee Josep Andreu i Lasarre] (1896â€“1983) in order to address the ways in which his story conjures up the complex set of relationships that inform Catalonia's position vis-a-vis a European culture of memory. Rivel became a star of the variety and circus circuit in Europe in the 1920s and 1930s. Already famous in Germany decades before the outbreak of war, the clown performed in sold-out theatres in Berlin from 1941 to 1944. Conjectures about the dilemmas that Charlie Rivel faced in Nazi-ruled Berlin have become the basis for Gerard Vazquez's play Uuuuh!

"BayesWHAM: A Bayesian approach for free energy estimation, reweighting, and uncertainty quantification in the weighted histogram analysis method","The weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM) is a powerful approach to estimate molecular free energy surfaces (FES) from biased simulation data. Bayesian reformulations of WHAM are valuable in proving statistically optimal use of the data and providing a transparent means to incorporate regularizing priors and estimate statistical uncertainties. In this work, we develop a fully Bayesian treatment of WHAM to generate statistically optimal FES estimates in any number of biasing dimensions under arbitrary choices of the Bayes prior. Rigorous uncertainty estimates are generated by Metropolis-Hastings sampling from the Bayes posterior. We also report a means to project the FES and its uncertainties into arbitrary auxiliary order parameters beyond those in which biased sampling was conducted. We demonstrate the approaches in applications of alanine dipeptide and the unthreading of a synthetic mimic of the astexin-3 lasso peptide.

Evaluation the structure of Sassanid era army,"This study has investigated the structure of Sassanid army. Sassanid Empire was the name of Persian family that was ruled from 224 until 651 AD about (427 years) over Iran. Sassanid Empire had a great army which in world of that day could defeat Iranian great opponent the Roman Empiremany times. The main and major part of their army was constituted by Eternal horsemen - ACHAEMENID relic â€“ but there is no information available about their number. Arms Riders combined with shield, helmet, armor, and other stuff that covers the head and hands, chest and feet. Horses also covered with metal components. Heavy cavalry arms of defensive weapons and it was the biggest advantage Sassanid army to the Parthian era. Cavalry weapons were bow and arrow, sword and mace and lasso hastate.

Limited feedback for cognitive radio networks using compressed sensing,"In this paper, we consider the downlink of a cognitive radio network where a cognitive base station serves multiple cognitive users on the same frequency band as a group of primary transceivers. The cognitive base station uses an orthogonal scheduling scheme (TDMA/FDMA) to serve its users. For this purpose, the base station is interested in acquiring an estimate of the interference (from the primary network) power at each of its cognitive receivers as a measure of channel quality. This can be surely achieved if we allow for the feedback (from the cognitive receivers to the cognitive base station) bandwidth to scale linearly in the number of cognitive receivers, but in densely populated networks, the cost of such an acquisition might be too high. This leads us to the question of whether we can do better in terms of bandwidth efficiency. We observe that in many scenarios - that are common in practice - where the primary network exhibits sparse changes in transmit powers from one scheduling instant to the next, it is possible to acquire this interference state with only a logarithmic scaling in feedback bandwidth. More specifically, in cognitive networks where the channels are solely determined by the positions of nodes, we can use compressed sensing to recover the interference state. In addition to being a first application of compressed sensing in the domain of limited feedback, to the best of our knowledge, this paper makes a key mathematical contribution concerning the favourable sensing properties of path-loss matrices that are composed of nonzero mean, dependent random entries. Finally, we numerically study the robustness properties of the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), a popular recovery algorithm, under two error models through simulations. The first model considers a varying amount of error added to all entries of the sensing matrix. The second one, a more adversarial model, considers a large amount of error added to only a fraction of the entries of the sensing matrix that are chosen uniformly at random. Simulation results establish that the LASSO recovery algorithm is robust to imperfect channel knowledge.",2010,"2010 48th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)"
Variable Selection and Shrinkage: Comparison of Some Approaches,"A common strategy within the framework of regression models is the selection of variables with possible predictive value, which are incorporated in the regression model. Two recently proposed methods, Breiman's Garotte (Breiman, 1995) and Tibshirani's Lasso (Tibshirani, 1996) try to combine variable selection and shrinkage. We compare these with pure variable selection and shrinkage procedures. We consider the backward elimination procedure as a typical variable selection procedure and as an example of a shrinkage procedure an approach of Van Houwelingen and Le Cessie (1990). Additionally an extension of van Houwelingens and le Cessies approach proposed by Sauerbrei (1999) is considered. The ordinary least squares method is used as a reference. 
 
 
 
With the help of a simulation study we compare these approaches with respect to the distribution of the complexity of the selected model, the distribution of the shrinkage factors, selection bias, the bias and variance of the effect estimates and the average prediction error.",2001,Statistica Neerlandica
Predicting olivine composition using Raman spectroscopy through band shift and multivariate analyses,"Abstract Olivine group minerals are ubiquitous in extrusive igneous rocks and play an important role in constraining equilibria for samples in the upper mantle and above. All Raman spectra of the olivine group minerals in the solid solution between forsterite (Fo, Mg2SiO4) and fayalite (Fa, Fe2SiO4) have a high-intensity doublet between 800 and 880 cmâ€“1. Previous studies used small sample suites with limited compositional ranges and varying spectrometers to relate energy shifts of these two bands to Mg/Fe contents. In this work, Raman spectra of 93 olivine samples were acquired on either Brukerâ€™s 532 nm (laser wavelength) Senterra or BRAVO (785/852.3 nm) spectrometer. This paper compares the two-peak band shift univariate method with two multivariate methods: partial least squares (PLS) and the least absolute shrinkage operator (Lasso). Data sets from several instruments are also examined to assess the most accurate method for predicting olivine composition from a Raman spectrum. Our 181-spectra PLS model is recommended for use when determining olivine composition from a Raman spectrum. For Raman spectra of mixed phases where only the olivine doublet can be identified, composition can best be determined using the position of the peak ca. 838â€“857 cmâ€“1 through use of the regression equation %Fo = â€“0.179625x2 + 310.077x â€“133 717 (where x = DB2 centroid in units of cmâ€“1). In situ methods for predicting mineral composition on planetary surfaces are critically important to extraterrestrial exploration going forward; of these, Raman spectroscopy is likely the best, as shown by the impending deployment of several Raman instruments to Mars (ExoMars and Mars 2020). More broadly, application of machine learning methods to spectral data processing have implications to multiple fields that use spectroscopic data.",2017,American Mineralogist
Deep-sea nematode assemblages of the Clarion-Clipperton Nodule Province (Tropical North-Eastern Pacific),"The deep-sea nematode assemblages of the French mining claim area in the Clarion-Clipperton Nodule Province (the Northeastern Pacific Basin, 14Â°N, 130Â°W, depth 4,947â€“5,046Â m) were studied at species, genus and family levels. Material was obtained using multicorers and box corers. In total, 2,174 individuals from 14 stations and 21 samples were examined. The nematode assemblages from the nodule-bearing (NB) part of the sampling area differed significantly from those at the nodule-free (NN) section. The average nematode density was 103 inds/10Â cm2. The average nematode densities in the NB and NN parts were 69 inds/10Â cm2 and 137 inds/10Â cm2 respectively. Altogether, at least 325 putative species, 97 valid genera and 33 valid families were found. The real number of nematode species for the sampling area was estimated at about 510. The richest genera were Acantholaimus (33 putative species) and Thalassomonhystera (23 putative species). The proportions of juveniles, males and females among nematode individuals were about 44%, 23% and 33% respectively. About 2/3 of all nematodes were deposit-feeders and around 1/3 were epistrate-feeders. The nematode assemblage of the studied area may be considered to be a Theristus discolensisâ€“Thalassomonhystera sp.3 assemblage with variation of the dominant species. The dominant species at the NN site were Theristus discolensis (12.2%) and Thalassomonhystera sp. 3 (5.3%). In contrast, at the NB site, Thalassomonhystera sp. 3 was most abundant (14.1%), followed by T. discolensis (6.2%). At genus level, Thalassomonhystera (17.9%), Theristus (13.0%) and Acantholaimus (12.8%) dominated at the NN site, whereas the abundance of Theristus was half of that (6.4%) at the NB site. The most dominant families at the NN and NB sites were Xyalidae (28.1% and 16.6%, respectively), Monhysteridae (17.9% and 25.3%) and Chromadoridae (16.2% and 22.5%).",2009,Marine Biodiversity

Generalized Conditional Gradient for Sparse Estimation,"Structured sparsity is an important modeling tool that expands the applicability of convex formulations for data analysis, however it also creates significant challenges for efficient algorithm design. In this paper we investigate the generalized conditional gradient (GCG) algorithm for solving structured sparse optimization problems---demonstrating that, with some enhancements, it can provide a more efficient alternative to current state of the art approaches. After providing a comprehensive overview of the convergence properties of GCG, we develop efficient methods for evaluating polar operators, a subroutine that is required in each GCG iteration. In particular, we show how the polar operator can be efficiently evaluated in two important scenarios: dictionary learning and structured sparse estimation. A further improvement is achieved by interleaving GCG with fixed-rank local subspace optimization. A series of experiments on matrix completion, multi-class classification, multi-view dictionary learning and overlapping group lasso shows that the proposed method can significantly reduce the training cost of current alternatives.",2017,J.

Une intention de salut. Essais sur la poÃ©sie franÃ§aise moderne by John Naughton (review),"John Naughton, Une intention de salut. Essais sur la poesie francaise moderne. Amsterdam and New York: Rodopi, 2012. 235 pp. This is a work of genuine academic piety. John Naughton, who launched his career as interpreter of modern French poetry with a book on Yves Bonnefoy (1984), develops in his title and final chapter a moving and substantial analysis of Bonnefoy as the exemplar of a new (atheistic or agnostic) modern faith in five major poets--and he accomplishes this essentially ethical intent with meticulous textual analyses. Naughton is a sensitive, trustworthy guide. After an avant-propos explaining his own flexible relationship with traditional faith-based motivation, he provides a wide-ranging ""Introduction: La poesie moderne et la tradition chretienne"" (13-43), which anticipates his approaches to Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Claudel, Louis-Rene des Forets, and Yves Bonnefoy. Each chapter is self-contained and some repetition of crucial quotations strengthens the book's pedagogical unity. Following Yves Bonnefoy's assertion that ""Nous autres venons apres les dieux"" (41), Naughton explores how each poet adapts the three theological virtues of faith, hope, and love. He begins by tracing the French sanctification of the poet from Hugo through Bonnefoy and insists that ""Claudel est le seul a avoir vecu la foi sans equivoque"" (41). The following five chapters plunge into those ambiguities. Naughton makes a convincing case for Baudelaire's essentially religious, though anti-bourgeois, orientation. ""Le probleme Baudelaire"" (43-87)--with its trendy medieval genitive following Sainte-Beuve (see La Folie Baudelaire by Roberto Calasso; John E. Jackson, La Mort Baudelaire)--warns against identifying author and poetic persona. Referring to approaches of Bonnefoy, Pierre Emmanuel, Pierre Jean Jouve, Leo Bersani, Charles Mauron, Steve Murphy, and others, Naughton stresses the dialectic of reality and escapism, ""Une extase faite de volupte et de connaissance"" (72, Baudelaire's italics). Baudelaire's own analysis of ecstasy (70-74) was provoked in part by Wagner's overture to Lohengrin as well as the drug experience. The poet's compassion provides a transition to ""L'experience de la charite chez Rimbaud"" (83-105), itself a transition chapter that provides analyses of Une saison en enfer and Rimbaud's relationship with his mother, with Verlaine, and the influence of his absent father. The chapter concludes by citing Rimbaud's appeal to American readers such as Henry Miller and Jim Morrison of The Doors. Rimbaud in Africa also receives insightful treatment. The next two chapters--""La Foi selon Paul Claudel"" (107-146) and ""Louis-Rene des Forets, Agonistes,"" (147-183)--illuminates the contrast between Claudel's militant Catholicism and the profound secularism of Des Forets, whom Naughton knew personally, and to whom he devoted an important monograph (1993). Naughtons analysis of Claudel's theatre is sympathetic and attempts to rescue that powerful personality from disdain by literary historians--but not without a bold moral judgment: certes, il semble que Paul Claudel ait eu besoin de la forteresse que l'Eglise lui a fournie. La rigidite de ses doctrines, la coherence de son enseignement, la beaute de ses rites, la regularite de ses pratiques, repondaient a une necessite chez lui et le defendait de forces obscures mais reelles: le doute, la passion, le chaos, la folie. Son orgueil, ses impatiences, sa soif de certitudes sont autant de fortifications contre l'ennemi, contre la peur. â€¦",2013,French Forum
Three Statistical Methods for the Social Sciences,"Social sciences offer particular challenges to statistics due to difficulties such as conducting randomized experiments in this domain, the large variation in humans, the difficulty in collecting complete datasets, and the typically unstructured nature of data at the human scale. New technology allows for increased computation and data recording, which has in turn brought forth new innovations for analysis.Because of these challenges and innovations, statistics in the social sciences is currently thriving and vibrant.This dissertation is an argument for evaluating statistical methodology in the social sciences along four major axes: \emph{validity}, \emph{interpretability}, \emph{transparency}, and \emph{employability}. We illustrate how one might develop methods that achieve these four goals with three case studies.The first is an analysis of post-stratification, a form of covariate adjustment to evaluate treatment effect. In contrast to recent results showing that regression adjustment can be problematic under the Neyman-Rubin model, we show post-stratification, something that can easily done in, e.g., natural experiments, has a similar precision to a randomized block trail as long as there are not too many strata. The difference is $O(1/n^2)$. Post-stratification thus potentially allows for transparently exploiting predictive covariates and random mechanisms in observational data. This case study illustrates the value of analyzing a simple estimator under weak assumptions, and of finding similarities between different methodological approaches so as to leverage earlier findings to a new domain.We then present a framework for building statistical tools to extract topic-specific key-phrase summaries of large text corpora (e.g., the New York Times) and a human validation experiment to determine best practices for this approach. These tools, built from high-dimensional, sparse classifiers such as L1-logistic regression and the Lasso, can be used to, for example, translate essential concepts across languages, investigate massive databases of aviation reports, or understand how different topics of interest are covered by various media outlets. This case study demonstrates how more modern methods can be evaluated using external validation in order to demonstrate that they produce meaningful and comprehendible results that can be broadly used.The third chapter presents the trinomial bound, a new auditing technique for elections rooted in very minimal assumptions. We demonstrated the usability of this technique by, in November 2008, auditing contests in Santa Cruz and Marin counties, California.The audits were risk-limiting, meaning they had a pre-specified minimum chance of requiring a full hand count if the outcomes were wrong. The trinomial bound gave better results than the Stringer bound, a tool common in accounting for analyzing financial audit samples drawn with probability proportional to an error bound. This case study focuses on generating methods that are employable and transparent so as to serve a public need.Throughout, we argue that, especially in the difficult domain of the social sciences, we must spend extra attention on the first axis of validity. This motivates our using the Neyman-Rubin model for the analysis of post-stratification, our developing an approach for external, model-independent validation for the key-phrase extraction tools, and our minimal assumptions for election auditing.",2012,
"Generalised M-Lasso for robust, spatially regularised hurst estimation","A generalised Lasso iteratively reweighted scheme is here introduced to perform spatially regularised Hurst estimation on semi-local, weakly self-similar processes. This is extended further to the robust, heavy-tailed case whereupon the generalised M-Lasso is proposed. The design successfully incorporates both a spatial derivative in the generalised Lasso regulariser operator and a weight matrix formulated in the wavelet domain. The result simultaneously spatially smooths the Hurst estimates and downweights outliers. Experiments using a Hampel score function confirm that the method yields superior Hurst estimates in the presence of strong outliers. Moreover, it is shown that the inferred weight matrix can be used to perform wavelet shrinkage and denoise fractional Brownian surfaces in the presence of strong, localised, band-limited noise.",2015,2015 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)
Predicting crack in a beam-like structure through an over fitting verified regression model,"The purpose of this paper is to identify the crack in beam-like structures before the complete failure or damage occurs to the structure. The beam-like structure plays an important role in modern architecture; hence, the safety of this structure is much dependent on the safety of the beam. Hence, predicting the cracks is much more important for the safety of the overall structure.,In the present work, the regression analysis has been carried out through LASSO and Ridge regression models. Both the statistical models have been well implemented in the detection of crack depth and crack location. A cantilever beam-like structure has been taken for the analysis in which the first three natural frequencies have been considered as the independent variable and crack location and depth is used as the dependent variable. The first three natural frequencies, f1, f2 and f3 are used as an independent variable. The crack location and crack depth are estimated though the regressor models and the accuracy are compared, to verify the correctness of the estimation.,As stated in the purpose of work, the main aim of the present work is to identify the crack parameters using an inverse technique, which will be more effective and will provide the results with less time. The data used for regression analysis are obtained from theoretical analysis and later the theoretical results are also verified through experimental analysis. The regression model developed is tested for its Bias Variance Trade-off (â€œBiasâ€ â€“ Overfitting, â€œvarianceâ€ â€“ generalization). The regression results have been compared with the theoretical results to check the robustness in the subsequent result section.,The idea is an amalgamation of existing and well-established technologies, that is aimed to achieve better performance for the given task. A regressor is trained from the data obtained through numerical simulation. The model is developed taking bias variance trade-off into consideration. This generalized model gives us very much acceptable performance.",2019,Multidiscipline Modeling in Materials and Structures
A technical tip to aid closure of the short external rotators in the posterior approach to the hip.,"Repairing the capsule and the short external rotators through drill holes is a popular method when using the posterior approach to the hip. Many surgeons use an expensive suture passer to pull through the stay sutures. Our method negates the need for that. A size 5 EthibondÂ® pack (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ, US) contains four sutures. Three are used to tag the posterior structures as stay sutures. The fourth has the curved needle straightened and passed retrograde through the drill holes (Fig 1). The loop of the thread can then â€˜lassoâ€™ the stay sutures and draw them out of the trochanter individually by pulling them through the drill holes.

Regularization Paths for Conditional Logistic Regression: The clogitL1 Package.,"We apply the cyclic coordinate descent algorithm of Friedman, Hastie, and Tibshirani (2010) to the fitting of a conditional logistic regression model with lasso [Formula: see text] and elastic net penalties. The sequential strong rules of Tibshirani, Bien, Hastie, Friedman, Taylor, Simon, and Tibshirani (2012) are also used in the algorithm and it is shown that these offer a considerable speed up over the standard coordinate descent algorithm with warm starts. Once implemented, the algorithm is used in simulation studies to compare the variable selection and prediction performance of the conditional logistic regression model against that of its unconditional (standard) counterpart. We find that the conditional model performs admirably on datasets drawn from a suitable conditional distribution, outperforming its unconditional counterpart at variable selection. The conditional model is also fit to a small real world dataset, demonstrating how we obtain regularization paths for the parameters of the model and how we apply cross validation for this method where natural unconditional prediction rules are hard to come by.",2014,Journal of statistical software
Bayesian sparse covariance decomposition with a graphical structure,"We consider the problem of estimating covariance matrices of a particular structure that is a summation of a low-rank component and a sparse component. This is a general covariance structure encountered in multiple statistical models including factor analysis and random effects models, where the low-rank component relates to the correlations among variables coming from the latent factors or random effects and the sparse component displays the correlations of the remaining residuals. We propose a Bayesian method for estimating the covariance matrices of such structures by representing the covariance model in the form of a factor model with an unknown number of latent factors. We introduce binary indicators for factor selection and rank estimation for the low-rank component, combined with a Bayesian lasso method for the estimation of the sparse component. Simulation studies show that our method can recover the rank as well as the sparsity of the two respective components. We further extend our method to a latent-factor Markov graphical model, with a focus on the sparse conditional graphical model of the residuals as well as selecting the number of factors. We show through simulations that our Bayesian model can successfully recover both the number of latent factors and the Markov graphical model of the residuals.",2016,Statistics and Computing
Laboratory evaluation of diatomaceous earth deposits mined from several locations in central and southeastern Europe as potential protectants against coleopteran grain pests,"Diatomaceous earth (DE) deposits from regions of central and southeastern Europe were evaluated for their insecticidal efficacy against Sitophilus oryzae (L.) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), Rhyzopertha dominica (F.) (Coleoptera: Bostrychidae) and Tribolium confusum Jacquelin du Val (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) in comparison with the commercially available DE formulation SilicoSec. The effects of temperature, RH, grain commodity (wheat, barley, maize, rice), application method (spraying vs. dusting) were evaluated. FYROM, a DE from the Former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia, was the most effective of the DE deposits for grain treatment, whereas the least effective was from Greece (named Crete). However, for surface treatment, Slovenia was the most effective followed by Elassona 1 and Begora. Increase of temperature increased DE efficacy, while the reverse was noted with the increase of RH. Furthermore, the DEs were more effective in barley or wheat than in maize or rice. Neither the mined DEs nor SilicoSec were able to suppress progeny production of the tested species after previous exposure on the treated commodities. Generally, dust application of DEs was more efficacious than spraying against S. oryzae and T. confusum. However, spraying of wheat significantly reduced the bulk density (test weight) compared to dusting. For surface treatment, after 1 d of exposure, Slovenia was the most effective of the mined DEs followed by Elassona 1 and Begora, whereas after 6 d of exposure the mortality was almost complete (>99%) with all three DEs. More than 6 d of exposure were required for an effective control of T. confusum adults with the remainder of the mined DEs.",2011,Crop Protection
A Grouped Structure-based Regularized Regression Model for Text Categorization,"The lasso regularization has successfully been used in regression models for feature selection; however, lasso considers all variable to be independent and noncorrelative, which will yield an excessively sparse solution (i.e., some important discriminating features might be discarded) if the features are highly correlated. This paper proposes a novel approach in which a sparse model was developed for text categorization. We firstly constructed a grouped structure according the correlation of text features, and then embedded the structure into a regression model via a between- and within- group sparse manner. The goal of such manner is that the groups containing many discriminating features can be selected even the features in these groups are highly correlated, and the noise within the selected groups could be discarded simultaneously, which is beneficial for classification. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a good tradeoff between performance and sparsity on three benchmark data sets.",2012,JSW

Bayesian Penalty Mixing: The Case of a Non-separable Penalty,"Separable penalties for sparse vector recovery are plentiful throughout statistical methodology and theory. Here, we confine attention to the problem of estimating sparse high-dimensional normal means. Separable penalized likelihood estimators are known to have a Bayesian interpretation as posterior modes under independent product priors. Such estimators can achieve rate-minimax performance when the correct level of sparsity is known. A fully Bayes approach, on the other hand, mixes the product priors over a shared complexity parameter. These constructions can yield a self-adaptive posterior that achieves rate-minimax performance when the sparsity level is unknown. Such optimality has also been established for posterior mean functionals. However, less is known about posterior modes in these setups. Ultimately, the mixing priors render the coordinates dependent through a penalty that is no longer separable. By tying the coordinates together, the hope is to gain adaptivity and achieve automatic hyperparameter tuning. Here, we study two examples of fully Bayes penalties: the fully Bayes LASSO and the fully Bayes Spike-and-Slab LASSO of Rockova and George (The Spike-and-Slab LASSO, Submitted). We discuss discrepancies and highlight the benefits of the two-group prior variant. We develop an Appell function apparatus for coping with adaptive selection thresholds. We show that the fully Bayes treatment of a complexity parameter is tantamount to oracle hyperparameter choice for sparse normal mean estimation.",2016,
Profiling of 179 miRNA Expression in Blood Plasma of Lung Cancer Patients and Cancer-Free Individuals,"Lung cancer is one of major cancers, and survival of lung cancer patients is dictated by the timely detection and diagnosis. Cell-free circulating miRNAs were proposed as candidate biomarkers for lung cancer. These RNAs are frequently deregulated in lung cancer and can persist in bodily fluids for extended periods of time, shielded from degradation by membrane vesicles and biopolymer complexes. To date, several groups reported the presence of lung tumour-specific subsets of miRNAs in blood. Here we describe the profiling of blood plasma miRNAs in lung cancer patients, healthy individuals and endobronchitis patients using miRCURY LNA miRNA qPCR Serum/Plasma Panel (Exiqon). From 241 ratios differently expressed between cancer patients and healthy individuals 19 miRNAs were selected for verification using the same platform. LASSO-penalized logistic regression model, including 10 miRNA ratios comprised of 14 individual miRNAs discriminated lung cancer patients from both control groups with AUC of 0.979.",2018,Scientific Reports
Notes on Parasites in Penguins (Spheniscidae) and Petrels (Procellariidae) in the Antarctic and Sub-antarctic,"Blood smears were examined from 143 penguins of four species (Aptenodytes patagonicus, Eudyptes chrysolophus, E. schlegeli, and Pygoscelis gentoo) from Sub-antarctic Macquarie Island and Heard Island. No blood parasites were reported. The vectors of Hepatozoon albatrossi (reported from three species of albatross) are probably shared by penguins, and it is suggested that the latter are not susceptible to infection with this protozoan. Cestodes of the genus Tetrabothrius were present in large numbers in the intestines of 17 Antarctic petrels (Thalassoica antarctica), and evidence is presented indicating that euphausiid crustaceans may be intermediate hosts.",1988,
Addressing the challenge of health measurement,"Assessing the health of populations is important for various reasons, especially for health policy purposes. Therefore, there exists a substantial need for health comparisons between populations, including the comparison of individuals, groups of persons, or even populations from different countries, at one point in time and over time. 
Two fundamentally different approaches exist to assess the health of populations. The first approach relies on indirect measures of health, which are based on mortality and morbidity statistics, and which are therefore only available at the population level. The second approach relies on direct measures of health, which are collected â€“ based on health surveys â€“ at the individual level. 
Based on the needs for comparisons, indirect measures appear to be less appropriate, as they are only available at the population level, but not at the individual or group level. Direct measures, however, are originally obtained at the individual level, and can then be aggregated to any group level, even to the population level. Therefore, direct measures seem to be more appropriate for these comparison purposes. 
The open question is then how to compare overall health based on data collected within health surveys. At first glance, a single general health question seems to be appealing. However, studies have shown that this kind of question is not appropriate to compare health over time, nor across populations. Qualitative studies found that respondents even consider very different aspects of health when responding to such a question. 
A more appropriate approach seems to be the use of data on several domains of health, as for example mobility, self-care and pain. Anyway, measuring health based on a set of domains is an extremely frequent approach. It provides more comprehensive information and can therefore be used for a wider range of possible applications. 
However, three open questions must be addressed when measuring health based on a set of domains. First, a parsimonious set of domains must be selected. Second, health measurement based on this set of domains must be operationalized in a standardized way. Third, this information must be aggregated into a summary measure of health, thereby taking into account that categorical responses to survey questions could be differently interpreted by respondents, and are not necessarily directly comparable. These open questions are addressed in this doctoral thesis. 
The overall objective of this doctoral thesis is to develop a valid, reliable and sensitive metric of health â€“ based on data collected on a set of domains â€“ that permits to monitor the health of populations over time, and which provides the basis for the comparisons of health across different populations. To achieve this aim two psychometric studies were carried out, entitled â€œTowards a Minimal Generic Set of Domainsâ€ and â€œDevelopment of a metric of healthâ€. 
In the first study a minimal generic set of domains suitable for measuring health both in the general population and in clinical populations was identified, and contrasted to the domains of the World Health Survey (WHS). 
The eight domains of the WHS â€“ mobility, self-care, pain and discomfort, cognition, interpersonal activities, vision, sleep and energy, and affect â€“ were used as a reference, as this set â€“ developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) â€“ so far constitutes the most advanced proposal of what to measure for international health comparisons. 
To propose the domains for the minimal generic set, two different regression methodologies â€“ Random Forest and Group Lasso â€“ were applied for the sake of robustness to three different data sources, two national general population surveys and one large international clinical study: the German National Health Interview and Examination Survey 1998, the United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2007/2008, and the ICF Core Set studies. A domain was selected when it was sufficiently explanatory for self-perceived health. 
Based on the analyses the following set of domains, systematically named based on their respective categories within the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF), was proposed as a minimal generic set: 
b130 Energy and drive functions 
b152 Emotional functions 
b280 Sensation of pain 
d230 Carrying out daily routine 
d450 Walking 
d455 Moving around 
d850 Remunerative employment 
Based on this set, four of the eight domains of the WHS were confirmed both in the general and in clinical populations: mobility, pain and discomfort, sleep and energy, and affect. The other WHS domains not represented in the proposed minimal generic set are vision, which was only confirmed with data of the general population, self-care and interpersonal activities, which were only confirmed with data of the clinical population and cognition, which could not be confirmed at all. 
The ICF categories of `carrying out daily routineÂ´ and `remunerative employmentÂ´ also fulfilled the inclusion criteria, though not directly related to any of the eight WHS domains. 
This minimal generic set can be used as the starting point to address one of the most important challenges in health measurement, namely the comparability of data across studies and countries. It also represents the first step for developing a common metric of health to link information from the general population to information about sub-populations, such as clinical and institutional populations, e.g. persons living in nursing homes. 
In the second study a sound psychometric measure was developed based on information collected on the domains of the minimal generic set: energy and drive functions, emotional functions, sensation of pain, carrying out daily routine, mobility and remunerative employment. It was demonstrated that this metric can be used to assess the health of populations and also to monitor health over time. 
To develop this metric of health, data from two successive waves of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) was used. A specific Item Response Theory (IRT) model, the Partial Credit Model (PCM), was applied on 12 items representing the 6 domains from the minimal generic set. All three IRT model assumptions â€“ unidimensionality, local independency and monotonicity â€“ were examined and found to be fulfilled. 
The developed metric showed sound psychometric properties: high internal consistency reliability, high construct validity and high sensitivity to change. Therefore, it can be considered an appropriate measure of population health. 
Furthermore, it was demonstrated how the health of populations can be compared based on this metric, for subgroups of populations, and over time. Finally, it was outlined how this metric can be used as the basis for comparing health across different populations, as for example from two different countries. 
The developed health metric can be seen as the starting point for a wide range of health comparisons, between individuals, groups of persons and populations as a whole, and both at one point in time and over time. It opens up a wide range of possible applications for both health care providers and health policy, and both in clinical settings and in the general population.",2014,
Fused lasso with the adaptation of parameter ordering in combining multiple studies with repeated measurements.,"Combining multiple studies is frequently undertaken in biomedical research to increase sample sizes for statistical power improvement. We consider the marginal model for the regression analysis of repeated measurements collected in several similar studies with potentially different variances and correlation structures. It is of great importance to examine whether there exist common parameters across study-specific marginal models so that simpler models, sensible interpretations, and meaningful efficiency gain can be obtained. Combining multiple studies via the classical means of hypothesis testing involves a large number of simultaneous tests for all possible subsets of common regression parameters, in which it results in unduly large degrees of freedom and low statistical power. We develop a new method of fused lasso with the adaptation of parameter ordering (FLAPO) to scrutinize only adjacent-pair parameter differences, leading to a substantial reduction for the number of involved constraints. Our method enjoys the oracle properties as does the full fused lasso based on all pairwise parameter differences. We show that FLAPO gives estimators with smaller error bounds and better finite sample performance than the full fused lasso. We also establish a regularized inference procedure based on bias-corrected FLAPO. We illustrate our method through both simulation studies and an analysis of HIV surveillance data collected over five geographic regions in China, in which the presence or absence of common covariate effects is reflective to relative effectiveness of regional policies on HIV control and prevention.",2016,Biometrics

When acquired by the collections in 1971, it displayed an extremely variegated aspect due to the presence of a layer of black paint with which it was partially covered and to various repainted areas, as well as to the results of insecticide treatment and unfortunate attempts at cleaning. Recent restoration has revealed the remaining original flesh tint and polychromy and has enabled us to clarify certain features of the iconography and decoration. The lengthy and delicate cleaning process was preceded by a technical study and analyses which led to the identification of the type of wood and pigments involved. Despite being incomplete, this work provides a striking illustration of the persistent vitality of Buddhist art in Kathmandu Valley in the 17th century.",2006,

Analysis of Network Lasso For Semi-Supervised Regression,"We characterize the statistical properties of network Lasso for semi-supervised regression problems involving network- structured data. This characterization is based on the con- nectivity properties of the empirical graph which encodes the similarities between individual data points. Loosely speaking, network Lasso is accurate if the available label informa- tion is well connected with the boundaries between clusters of the network-structure datasets. We make this property precise using the notion of network flows. In particular, the existence of a sufficiently large network flow over the empirical graph implies a network compatibility condition which, in turn, en- sures accuracy of network Lasso.",2019,ArXiv
Sparse non-linear denoising of fMRI : Performance and pattern reproducibility,"Non-linear embedding improves mental state decoding in fMRI. Here we investigate the possibility of non-linear denoising by kernel Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The main challenge is the mapping of denoised feature space points back into input space, also referred to as â€the pre-image problemâ€. Since the feature space mapping is typically not bijective, pre-image estimation is inherently illposed. In many applications, including functional MRI data, it is of interest to find a sparse signal, hence we investigate sparse reconstruction by Lasso regularization. It is found that sparse estimation provides better predictability and a more reproducible pre-image. Using the combined prediction/reproducibility metric we may optimize the degree of sparsity and the non-linearity of the kernel embedding.",2010,
Remoteness and Maize Price Volatility in Burkina Faso,"â€¢ Markets located far from the major urban centers (Ouagadougou, Bobo-Dioulasso, or Koudougou) register the highest levels of price volatility. This result is robust to alternative measures of remoteness. â€¢ Maize surplus markets and markets bordering CÃ´te dâ€™Ivoire, Togo, and Ghana have experienced more volatile prices than maize-deficit and nonbordering markets have. â€¢ There is evidence of seasonal patterns in maize price volatility across Burkinabe markets.

Joint estimation of $K$ related regression models with simple $L_1$-norm penalties,"We propose a new approach, along with refinements, based on $L_1$ penalties and aimed at jointly estimating several related regression models. Its main interest is that it can be rewritten as a weighted lasso on a simple transformation of the original data set. In particular, it does not need new dedicated algorithms and is ready to implement under a variety of regression models, {\em e.g.}, using standard R packages. Moreover, asymptotic oracle properties are derived along with preliminary non-asymptotic results, suggesting good theoretical properties. Our approach is further compared with state-of-the-art competitors under various settings on synthetic data: these empirical results confirm that our approach performs at least similarly to its competitors. As a final illustration, an analysis of road safety data is provided.",2014,arXiv: Methodology
Purification of modified vaccinia virus Ankara from suspension cell culture,"Background A spectrum of viral vaccines, including the annual 620 million doses of trivalent influenza vaccines, are being produced in embryonated eggs of pharmaceutical quality, or with primary cells derived from such eggs [1,2]. Regulatory guidelines and experience for these processes are established and proven against time for 75 years [1]. However, production with galline primary material is not optimal and producers sometimes struggle to provide needed vaccine doses. Among the challenges are limitations in supply [3] and that rigid intervalls between husbandry, harvest of eggs and inoculation with vaccine seed must be accomodated [4]. Manipulation of embryonated eggs and disposal of solid biohazardous waste that accumulates if vaccines are being produced in egg cavities come at considerable costs [5,6]. Finally, risk of contamination with environmental and endogenous agents is high [7-9]. Such issues can be circumvented if a continuous cell line is used to propagate viral vaccines [1]. Master Cell Banks can be prepared in sufficient amounts and tested for presence of adventitious agents ahead of production, chemically defined media obviate dependence on animal derived components, and predictable seed trains towards a wide range of bioreactor volumes allow flexible and fast response times for vaccine production [10]. However, there is a regulatory concern that DNA derived from the immortal production substrate may be transferred to vaccine recipients [1]. Risk calculations that relate values for the length of typical oncogenes, number of such genes in the genome and fragmentation of DNA during purification have arrived at a permissive threshold of 10 ng of nucleic acid per vaccine dose [1]. Materials and methods We investigated purification of modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) produced on the continuous avian cell line CR.pIX. MVA is a versatile and highly immunogenic viral vector, but also known to pose unique challenges in production processes [11]. For example, the majority of the infectious units of MVA remain cellassociated so that downstream purification must initiate with a complete lysate of the infected cultures (rather than cell-free supernatant). The viral particles are furthermore too large for conventional filtration, centrifugation and chromatographic separation. Finally, because MVA cannot amplify in human recipients, a desired safety feature, each vaccine dose requires 108 infectious units for full efficacy. This dose is 400-fold above that recommended for replication-competent poxviruses and necessitates efficient and robust manufacturing processes [10]. Derivation and properties of the anatine CR.pIX cell line have been described previously [12], as well as cellassociated propagation of poxviruses in suspension cultures in chemically-defined media by induction of CR. pIX aggregates [10]. We used GFP-recombinant versions of both genetically stable strains of MVA, wildtype and strain MVA-CR that was isolated previously with help of the suspension process [13]. Purification of MVA was performed with CIM monolithic chromatography columns from Bia Separations [14]. The CIM monoliths consist of a single piece of highly porous material with a network of branched channels. These channels can be provided with large 6 Î¼m-diameters and can be functionalized with various ion exchange groups.",2015,BMC Proceedings
"Distinct subsets of non-coding RNAs are strongly associated with BMD and fracture, studied in weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing human bone.","We investigated mechanisms resulting in low bone mineral density (BMD) and susceptibility to fracture by comparing non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in biopsies of non-weight-bearing (NWB) iliac (nÂ =Â 84) and weight bearing (WB) femoral (nÂ =Â 18) postmenopausal bone across BMDs varying from normal (T-scoreâ€‰>â€‰-1.0) to osteoporotic (T-scoreâ€‰â‰¤â€‰-2.5). Global bone ncRNA concentrations were determined by PCR and microchip analyses. Association with BMD or fracture, adjusted by age and body mass index, were calculated using linear and logistic regression and Lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) analysis. At 10% false discovery rate (FDR), 75 iliac bone ncRNAs and 94 femoral bone ncRNAs, were associated with total hip BMD. Eight of the ncRNAs were common for the two sites, but five of them (miR-484, miR-328-3p, miR-27a-5p, miR-28-3p, and miR-409-3p) correlated positively to BMD in femoral bone, but negatively in iliac bone. Of predicted pathways recognized in bone metabolism, ECM-receptor interaction and Proteoglycans in cancer emerged at both sites, while e.g. Fatty acid metabolism and Focal adhesion were only identified in iliac bone. Lasso analysis and cross-validations identified sets of nine bone ncRNAs correlating strongly with adjusted total hip BMD in both femoral and iliac bone. Twenty-eight iliac ncRNAs were associated with risk of fracture (FDRâ€‰<â€‰0.1). The Small Nucleolar RNAs, RNU44 and RNU48, have a function in stabilization of ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), and their association with fracture and BMD suggest that aberrant processing of rRNAs may be involved in development of osteoporosis. Cis-eQTL analysis of the iliac bone biopsies identified two loci associated with miRNAs, one previously identified in a heel-BMD genome-wide association study (GWAS). In this comprehensive investigation of the skeletal genetic background in post-menopausal women, we identified functional bone ncRNAs associated to fracture and BMD, representing distinct subsets in WB and NWB skeletal sites.

"Die klastischen Sedimente von SÃ¼d-ElfenbeinkÃ¼ste : Provenanz, Umlagerungsprozesse und Entstehung des Goldvorkommens 'Belle Ville'","In meiner Arbeit untersuche ich Prozesse, die im Gebiet des randlichen 'Cote dâ€™Ivoire'-Beckens die Ausbildung der klastischen Sedimente bestimmten. Fur die Untersuchung wahlte ich kretazische bis tertiare Sedimente des Beckens und quartare, goldfuhrende Ablagerungen nordlich des Beckenrands aus. 
Die Schwermineralassoziation der Sedimente von Alb bis Turon zeigt nahegelegene Liefergebiete und kurze Transportwege an. Die Schwermineralfuhrung der Sedimente von spatem Cenoman bis Neogen lasst auf eine Vergroserung des Liefergebiets und auf einen langeren Transport schliesen. Der Wechsel in der Schwermineralassoziation wahrend des spaten Cenomans zeigt den Ubergang von der Syn-Rift-Phase mit einer storungsgebundenen Kliffkuste zu der Drift-Phase mit einer Ausgleichskuste auf einem schmalen Schelf. Tertiare Meeresspiegelschwankungen fuhrten mehrfach zur Freilegung des Schelfs und zu lateritischen Bodenbildungen auf den randmarinen Sedimenten. Aufgrund des Sudwest-Monsuns herrschte wahrend des Neogens ein ostlich gerichteter Strandversatz vor. Dagegen uberwog wahrend des spaten Cenoman bis ins Palaogen ein Sudost-Passat, der einen westlich gerichteten, lateralen Sedimenttransport verursachte. 
Nordlich des Beckenrands befinden sich uber alteriertem Basement sedimentare Goldvorkommen. Die Primarmineralisation fand wahrend einer bruchhaften Deformationsphase im Proterozoikum statt. Ein humid-tropisches Klima fuhrte zur Ausbildung von machtigen Verwitterungsdecken. Das Gold unterlag supergener Alteration. Wahrend einer arideren Klimaphase kam es zur Zerschneidung der Rumpfflache. Das Gold wurde dabei mechanisch umgelagert. Anschliesende chemische Verwitterung zeigt die Ruckkehr humid-tropischer Verhaltnisse an. 
Die Korrelation von Flachenbildungs- und Einschneidungsphasen zeigt, dass die randliche Zertalung der neogenen Beckensedimente zeitgleich mit der Ausbildung der goldfuhrenden Sedimente wahrend einer interpluvialen Phase im Pleistozan stattfand. 
 
In this study the processes, which are responsible for the development of the clastic sediments in southern Ivory Coast are investigated. For this reconstruction I selected Cretaceous to Tertiary basin sediments and Quaternary gold-bearing deposits near the northern margin of the basin. 
The heavy mineral assemblage of Albian to Turonian sediments reflect a narrow source rock area and short transport distances. A prominent change in the heavy mineral association of late Cenomanian to Neogene sediments indicates enlargement of source area and longer storage of sediment within the littoral energy fence. The sudden change within the heavy mineral associations marks the transition from the late syn-rift stage with a basin margin controlled by steep slopes to the passive margin stage with development of a narrow shelf area. Tertiary sea level changes led to multiple exposing of the shelf and subsequent development of latosols on marginal marine sediments. The predominance of the southwesterly monsoonal winds in the Neogene caused a W-E directed longshore drift. In contrast, the longshore drift during the late Cenomanian to Paleogene was driven by the southeasterly trade wind and therefore directed to the west. 
Sedimentary gold deposits overlay altered basement north of the basin margin. The primary mineralisation developed during a brittle deformation phase in the Proterozoic. A tropical-humid climate led to the development of intense chemical weathering. The gold underwent supergene alteration. The peneplain was dissected during an arid climate phase. Gold grains were mechanically dispersed. A subsequent tropical-humid climate caused re-establishment of chemical weathering conditions. Correlation of peneplain development and phases of dissection indicate that the dissection of Neogene basin sediments and development of the gold-bearing sediments was time-equivalent and happened during an interpluvial phase in the Pleistocene.",2001,
Early medieval TâŠ˜nsberg â€” dating problems and the results,"According to the 13th century Icelandic Saga writer Snorre Sturlasson, there was a marketplace (in old Norwegian: Kaupstadir) in the TâŠ˜nsberg area by the end of the 9th century. The origin of the medieval town of TâŠ˜nsberg has therefore been much discussed in the light of this statement. Viking Age and early medieval settlements often lack material datable by archaeology alone. In TâŠ˜nsberg radiocarbon dating has been used to distinguish between Viking Age deposits and medieval deposits, when stratigraphy alone does not state the differences. However, this dating method has produced various results and there is obvious need for a local calibration.",1990,Norwegian Archaeological Review

Retrograde ureteral stent exchange under fluoroscopic guidance.,"PURPOSE
The aim of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of fluoroscopy-guided retrograde double-J stent exchange.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Between March 2003 and June 2005, 39 retrograde ureteral stent exchange procedures on 19 patients and 24 ureters were performed under fluoroscopic guidance. Seventeen of the patients were female and 2 were male. All procedures were done on an outpatient basis unless the patient was already an inpatient. All exchanges were performed through 10 F introducer sheaths. Once the stent was grasped, the sheath, the snare and/or the wire holding the stent were pulled out as a unit. For retrieving the stents, several different techniques (guide wire lasso and wire snaring) were used in addition to simple snare technique. Two parallel stents were placed for each ureter in 2 patients (3 ureters) after a history of stent occlusion in less than 3 months.


RESULTS
Technical success rate was 100%. Procedure time ranged from 16 to 38 minutes (average, 21 min). There were no major complications. All patients had minor hematuria after the procedure which resolved within one day.


CONCLUSION
Fluoroscopy-guided retrograde double-J stent exchange is a safe and effective procedure and can easily be performed with equipment and techniques used in daily interventional practice.",2009,Diagnostic and interventional radiology

Analisi rigido-plastica per elementi finiti,"SuntoSi presenta un procedimento per la valutazione numerica del carico di collasso di solidi o strutture costituiti da un materiale schematizzabile come rigido-idealmente plastico. Il metodo si basa sul teorema cinematico del calcolo a rottura, che viene ricondotto alla ricerca del minimo di un funzionale, convesso ma non ovunque differenziabile, sotto vincoli lineari di eguaglianza. La soluzione viene affrontata mediante discretizzazione per elementi finiti. Caratteristiche del metodo proposto sono: (1) il ricorso alla formulazionenaturale dell'approccio agli spostamenti, che consente di cosiderare elementi finiti di ordine comunque elevato; (2) la strategia risolutiva, basata sull'identificazione degli elementi che si mantengono rigidi a collasso, la cui progressiva eliminazione dal problema consente di superare le difficoltÃ  connesse con la non regolaritÃ  della funzione obiettivo; (3) il ricorso a particolari formulazioni di tipomisto, che eliminano possibili fenomeni dilocking senza compromettere la natura cinematica dell'approccio.

"RectificaciÃ³n de Guillermo Hierrezuelo Conde a la recensiÃ³n del libro de Juan Francisco Baltar RodrÃ­guez, El Protonotario de AragÃ³n. 1472-1707. La CancillerÃ­a aragonesa en la Edad Moderna","En 2002 publicamos una recension de un libro de Juan Francisco Baltar Rodriguez, editado por el Justicia de Aragon en 2001 y dedicado al Protonotario de Aragon. Haciamos en la citada recension grandes elogios de Baltar. Hace poco tuvimos conocimiento del error en que habiamos incurrido pues habia plagios flagrantes en dicha obra. Rectifico aqui lo publicado en su momento y senalo el conjunto de plagios de Baltar hechos a una tesis doctoral inedita de Jose Solis, que todavia no se ha publicado, y cuyo contenido Baltar conocia por haber sido miembro suplente de la Comision llamada a evaluar dicha memoria, sobre la que emitio un informe positivo. El asunto es mayormente grave cuando el plagio se hace de algo que es inedito, pero que goza de la proteccion y publicidad de haber sido defendido ante un tribunal y ademas con el abuso de confianza que conlleva que Juan Francisco Baltar, conociendolo por su oficio, lo plagie. Este libro del ano 2001 contiene, en el texto y en las notas a pie de pagina del capitulo 5 y del capitulo 6 de la parte dedicada al Â«Desarrollo historico de la Protonotaria de AragonÂ», algunos parrafos copiados casi literalmente de la tesis doctoral inedita de Jose Solis, asi como varias citas bibliograficas y referencias de documentos del Archivo Historico Nacional tomadas y copiadas por Baltar â€“dandolas y haciendolas pasar como aportaciones propiasâ€“ de dicha tesis doctoral inedita de Solis, del ano 1999 y titulada Â«La Administracion espanola del archiduque Carlos. Consejos y Juntas en la Monarquia de Carlos de Austria de EspanaÂ». Semejante actividad de plagin y copista de la obra ajena â€“lo cual presuntamente era plagio en el ano 2001 y que, en la actualidad, se encuentra ya prescrito como tal delito por haber transcurrido mas de 5 anos desde su ejecucionâ€“ Juan Francisco Baltar trataba de encubrirla o disimularla torpemente, por medio de la nota 449 de la p. 183 de este libro, nota referida unicamente al capitulo 6 y que no dice nada sobre el capitulo 5. La citada nota 449 del libro de Juan Francisco Baltar constituye, en realidad, un reconocimiento o una confesion de parte, puesto que no consigue otro efecto que reconocer y proclamar el presunto plagio o la copia que ha realizado. No llega ni a citar el nombre del autor copiado, como no indica tampoco, en ninguna parte, el titulo ni la fecha de la tesis doctoral inedita copiada, que no se incluye, por cierto, en la abundante y no siempre utilizada bibliografia de este libro. La verdad es que el profesor Solis (segun precisa advertencia que nos ha sido hecha por su parte) en ningun caso, ni en ningun momento, ha tenido la amabilidad de facilitar al profesor Baltar dicha informacion sobre el protonotario, en contra de lo que se afirma en la nota 449 del libro. Lo plagiado o copiado por Baltar no es informacion, sino simple copia literal o no literal de algunas cositas del texto de la tesis doctoral de Jose Solis (un hombre honrado cuyo honor ha sido profanado por Baltar y que fue maltratado por la escuela de Baltar con ocasion de varios concursos) y apropiacion indebida de las fuentes tanto manuscritas o documentales como impresas o bibliograficas utilizadas por Solis. Forma parte Baltar de la Honorable Cofradia de plagines, copistas, plagiarios, copiones, plagiones, policopiones y pantaplagiones de la Escuderia, la escuela de Jose Antonio Escudero Lopez (no todos en esta escuela son enemigos de la propiedad intelectual; hay incluso varios investigadores sumamente solventes y reconocidos como tales, con premios), en la que tienen cabida los miembros de pleno de derecho de la misma: [1o) el citado plagin y copista Juan Francisco Baltar; 2o) la gran plagiona y policopiona de La Coruna Maria Emma Montanos Ferrin que ha copiado a Francesco Calasso, a Celestino Pardo, a Rodriguez Mourullo y a Alfonso Otero Varela, que fue el primero en denunciar las trapisondas que se traia Montanos, acercandose a viejetes y a otros que no lo son tanto, a los que sacaba ideas, parrafos, trabajos y textos ineditos, etc.; 3o) la plagiona Concepcion Gomez Roan, que protagonizo el escandaloso plagio del proyecto docente de Ricardo Gomez Rivero descubierto por Alicia Fiestas Loza; 4o) el plagin Dionisio Perona Tomas, tambien fiel e infiel seguidor del proyecto docente de Gomez Rivero, ante la actitud completamente impasible, en un primer momento, de Escudero Lopez y, sobre todo, de Feliciano Barrios, que, segun Escudero, debia haber revisado los proyectos en vez de proporcionarles un ejemplar para que lo copiaran y 5o) la copista Consuelo Juanto, descubierta por Carlos Garriga con ocasion de unas habilitaciones de titulares], junto a otros, los antes mediopensionistas y ahora externos a la escuderia: el plagion Ignacio Ruiz Rodriguez que copio a Luis Antonio Ribot Garcia, deshonrando de forma apocaliptica a don Juan Jose de Austria y de Aragon, y lo copio en un libro erroneamente dirigido, falsamente coordinado y de resultados catastroficos, salido de la mano de Jose Antonio Escudero Lopez, donde aparece un articulo horripilantemente malo de Jose Ramon Rodriguez Besne donde no solo queda pesimamente el autor, sino que desnaturaliza y de que forma al noveno conde Oropesa (un hombre como don Manuel Joaquin Alvarez de Toledo no se merecia lo que Besne ha contado sobre su vida: lo ha hundido para siempre, mientras no sea recuperado por alguien del abismo); y, el segundo externo, el pantaplagion que lo copio todo y no dejo nada en el tintero, que ni siquiera llego a usar, pues lo saco directamente de un diskette: Emilio Lecuona Prats, que plagio 143 paginas de un proyecto docente en 2001, siendo el autor material de uno de 5 paginas y media [una autentica porqueria, donde solo citaba dos libros frente a las centenares de referencias bibliograficas que habia en el segundo proyecto, el que copio; para colmo en el suyo se declaraba partidario de la microhistoria juridica, estudiar la historia de su pueblo, el aldeanismo juridico, la historia de Lanzarote en la que el se considera especialista; la antitesis de lo que se predica actualmente por los grandes sabios europeos de Historia del Derecho] para conseguir un puntuacion de 9,5 puntos, cuando por este segundo (el primero elaborado por el) habia recibido un 1, y volvio a copiar el proyecto docente canario en 2007, con ocasion de sus oposiciones de habilitacion, sin que se le descubriera en ninguno de esos dos momentos procesales, sino despues. Gracias a este pantaplagion, que reconocio haber plagiado, aunque se llamaba a si mismo plagista (el plagin es poco relevante y ni siquiera debe ser sancionado, copista y plagista son como las antiguas ordenes menores, es decir copistas de poco relieve; los copiones y los plagiarios son ya delincuentes, el policopion es como si fuera un obispo y la birreta cardenalicia del universo plagiario es la que ostentan los pantaplagiones: son los purpurados, el grado maximo), pero a Lecuona Prats se le ocurrio litigar diciendo que no se le podia llamar plagion, y sendos autos de 1 de junio de 2010 y de 29 de octubre de 2010, en los que no se supero la simple diligencia previa, basandose en diversas SSTC de 1985, 1986, 1988, 1989, 2002, etc., que interpretaban el art. 20.1. de la Constitucion espanola de 1978 (las diferencias cientificas no tienen nada que ver con las controversias penales), ahora nos permiten poder llamarle a el, a Lecuona Prats, plagion, plagista, plagiario, copista y copion, sin ofenderle, porque no es una ofensa sino una realidad, y ademas al haber intentado litigar tambien atribuyendose la representacion de la escuela de J. A. Escudero, y mencionando a Maria Emma Montanos, Consuelo Juanto, Concepcion Gomez Roan y Dionisio Perona Tomas, ahora se les pueden aplicar a ellos y a ellas esos mismos calificativos y patentizar su falta de credibilidad cientifica. Pero, en honor a la verdad, solo a Montanos y a Gomez Roan, se las puede denominar plagionas y copionas, siendo Juanto y Perona simples plagines y copistas. El caso de Baltar es tambien el de un plagista y copista, no es ni policopion, ni plagion, digamos que es un hombre que descuida unas veces lo que escribe, que toma, que deja de tomar, etc., que cita a Ernesto Schafer, en concreto su libro sobre el Consejo Real y Supremo de Indias, pero que al menos una quincena de veces en el trabajo de Baltar sobre las Juntas de Gobierno en la monarquia hispanica lo copia sin citarlo o le toma referencias de archivo, sin indicar que ha sido Schafer quien ha descubierto dichas referencias en los archivos, y poniendo a veces comillas en un sitio, pero luego evitandolas en otro y dando como de redaccion propia lo que era de Schafer. Es bueno saber que en Alemania se ha retirado desde 2009 el titulo de doctor a varios plagistas y plagiones que copiaron o mal citaron con ocasion de sus tesis, algunos relacionados con la politica y otros que no lo estaban, y eso se ha hecho en Universidades de relieve como las de Constanza, Heidelberg, Bayreuth, etc. Ademas Baltar reproduce amplisimos listados bibliograficos en sus libros, que toma de aqui y de alla y luego no cita para nada a esos autores en el cuerpo de la obra. Baltar, Montanos, Gomez Roan, Juanto y Perona se deben creer que, en un mundo lleno de herodianos y fariseos, esto de publicar es un arte que permite ciertas licitudes y atraviesa por diversas vicisitudes, y si uno se equivoca ya Voltaire lo dejo claro: Â«Pour la pluspart des hommes, se corriger consiste a changer les defautsÂ».",2011,Revista Europea de Historia de las Ideas PolÃ­ticas y de las Instituciones PÃºblicas
En la bÃºsqueda de un modelo adaptado de competencia para la cortÃ© suprema de justicia de la nacion,"Normal 0 14 Gli autori si pongono il problema dellâ€™ampia competenza della Corte Suprema argentina illustrando, con rigorosa precisione, gli elementi normativi costituzionali e non costituzionali. Questi ultimi, progressivamente adattati alle esigenze del contesto giuridico nazionale e interazionale, avrebbero inciso sulla suddetta competenza ampliandola. Cosi la Corte Suprema argentina, agli occhi degli autori, avrebbe perso gradualmente il carattere di eccezionalita proprio di tale organo dello Stato, diventando una terza istanza federale nella quale si vedrebbe oggi un rischio pressoche latente di collasso, o almeno di eccessivo sovraccarico di lavoro. Per questo il saggio propone lâ€™analisi di possibili modelli alternativi, ricorrendo allo studio non solo del modello nordamericano, il quale va studiato anche nei suoi profili storici, ma anche dei diversi sistemi latinoamericani ed europei, sempre nel tentativo, di trovare un modello adatto di competenza per la Corte Suprema argentina e la particolare situazione giuridica del Paese australe, rilevata con acuta e aggiornatissima visione realistica.",2014,
"Digital Surface Model, Minnesota (2006-2012)","The Digital Surface Model (DSM) was created to represent the terrain and all object present on that terrain. This included buildings, tree cover, roads, and other natural and human-altered landscapes. In effect, the DSM is a three dimensional representation of Minnesota. It was generated using a Streaming Delauney Triangulation process through rapidlasso's LAStools software package. In this process, triangles are iteratively generated using nearby lidar returns and values for each point are determined by extracting interpolated elevation from the surface of the triangle. The result is a 1 meter resolution raster covering the state. Lidar is a form of active remote sensing technology that uses light pulses, most commonly in the near-infrared wavelengths, to collected surface elevation data. A laser scanner, mounted in an aircraft and combined with high-accuracy GPS, collects light returns that are interpolated into a point cloud. Each point represents one return from a laser pulse. The laser pulse has the ability to penetrate vegetation, multiple laser returns can be gathered for each pulse including the returns from below the vegetation.The accuracy of lidar returns allow for a unique, multi-faceted analytical dataset. The first point returns can be used to interpolate a topology of Minnesota that models the objects (i.e. building, trees, etc) and geography resting upon the terrain. The lidar point files for the state of Minnesota used in the study were collected between 2006 and 2012 through an intergovernmental initiative with the primary object of providing improved elevation data for flood mapping. In some regions, existing lidar data was acquired and transformed to new state standards. Areas where data did not exist or could not be transformed, were collected by contracted vendors. The composite data forms a seamless coverage of the state with a resolutions of at least 1.5 meters. Refer to metadata.html for full details.",2015,

Retention of sulfasalazine tablets,"To The Editor: We read with interest the paper by Harary et al (1) regarding the gastric retention of enteric-coated sulfasalazine tablets. Two main consequences were possible aggravation of obstruction by the pillassociated physical barrier and unpredictability of the therapeutic benefit of the tablet. Recently, a 52-year-old woman, with a six-year history of Crohn's disease involving the ileum and colonic hepatic flexure, was admitted to our Unit with a four-month history of recurrent and selflimited episodes of intestinal obstruction. Upper gastrointestinal series showed an ileum grossly affected, but allowing transit of barium to the colon. She was treated with parenteral hyperalimentation and then with enteral nutrition by continuous infusion with a good tolerance. Parenteral corticosteroids and oral sulfasalazine (one 500-mg tablet four times daily) were administered. The patient was operated on six weeks after admission because obstruction did not resolve, in fact it had even worsened. At operation, Crohn's disease involving ileum and colonic hepatic flexure was confirmed, then corroborated by histologic assessment. A lot of complete sulfasalazine tablets were observed in the intestinal lumen, proximal to the obstructing area. In our case, we think that altered intestinal transit time and pH were probably the causes for the absence of disintegration of the tablets, thus contributing to the maintenance or aggravation of the obstruction by a physical barrier phenomenon and precluding the therapeutic effect of the drug. In patients with small bowel Crohn' s disease with a partial obstruction to the transit of intestinal contents, oral tablets should be used with caution.

Evaluating Different Periodic Seasonal Time Series Model for Efficient Short-Term Wind Speed Prediction,"The importance of wind speed predictions, which is the source for wind power, is in the focus of interest. Accurate predictions are crucial for the energy production. Developing short-term wind forecasts helps to increase the productivity of wind energy. Moreover, the energy supply can be optimized, by increasing the accuracy of wind speed predictions, particularly the feed-in of wind power. The wind speed forecasting approaches presented here use 10-minute data collected at several stations in Germany. An overview of different periodic and seasonal time series models are given. The seasonality that is modelled by some periodic base function is combined with a long memory process and heteroscedasticity. Therefore, an ARFIMA(p,d,q)-APARCH(P,Q) process is comprised and applied to the correlated residuals. In contrast to the classical Fourier functions, cubic B-splines are used to model the periodicity. Furthermore, a common time series model is provided and applied to the wind speed. The feature is a time-saving approach for modelling and predicting. Hence, we introduce an iteratively reweighted least squares and lasso method. The most important findings are forecasting enhancements up to six hours and a simple and fast estimation and prediction method.",2014,
Weighted Lasso in Graphical Gaussian Modeling for Large Gene Network Estimation Based on Microarray Data,"We propose a statistical method based on graphical Gaussian models for estimating large gene networks from DNA microarray data. In estimating large gene networks, the number of genes is larger than the number of samples, we need to consider some restrictions for model building. We propose weighted lasso estimation for the graphical Gaussian models as a model of large gene networks. In the proposed method, the structural learning for gene networks is equivalent to the selection of the regularization parameters included in the weighted lasso estimation. We investigate this problem from a Bayes approach and derive an empirical Bayesian information criterion for choosing them. Unlike Bayesian network approach, our method can find the optimal network structure and does not require to use heuristic structural learning algorithm. We conduct Monte Carlo simulation to show the eectiveness of the proposed method. We also analyze",2007,Genome Informatics
"Jurassic-Cretaceous (Bathonian to Cenomanian) palynology and stratigraphy of the West Tiba-1 borehole, northern Western Desert, Egypt","Abstract Land-derived pollen and spores and marine dinoflagellate cysts were extracted from the Jurassic and Cretaceous sediments of the West Tiba-1 borehole, northern Western Desert, Egypt, On the basis of the recovered palynomorphs, of known stratigraphical significance, the following stages were assessed: Bathonian-Oxfordian (Middle-Late Jurassic) and Hauterivian, Aptian-Early Albian, Late Albian-Early Cenomanian, Early Cenomanian and Late Cenomanian (Early-Middle Cretaceous). No palynomorphs diagnostic for the Berriasian, Valanginian and Barremian stages (Early Cretaceous) were depicted. Based on the nature and composition of the identified palynomorph content, five informal palynomorph assemblage zones were recognised. These are: the Gonyaulacysta jurassica-Korystocysta kettonensis Assemblage Zone (PI, Bathonian-Oxfordian), Ephedripites-Aequitriradites verrucosus Assemblage Zone (PII, Hauterivian), Afropollis jardinus-Duplexisporites generalis-Tricolpites Assemblage Zone (PIIl, Aptian-Early Albian), Nyssapollenites-Elaterosporites Assemblage Zone (PIV, Late Albian-Early Cenomanian) and Assemblage Zone PV (Early-Late Cenomanian).

The Effect of Active Surveillance on Reducing Methicillin- Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (mrsa) Bacteremia Rates within the Scripps Health Organization (2007-2010),"OF THE THESIS The Effect of Active Surveillance on Reducing Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) Bacteremia Rates within the Scripps Health Organization (2007-2010) by Lucia Pasqualina Camperlengo Master of Public Health San Diego State University, 2012 MRSA continues to be an important cause of morbidity and mortality among inpatients. Blood stream infections (BSIs) are one of the most serious nosocomial complications, are relatively easy to diagnose and are a marker for the spread of other resistant organisms between hospitalized patients. In 2008, a law (SB1058) was passed that directed hospitals towards active surveillance of MRSA in an attempt to decrease rates of transmission. The law states that hospitals must screen high risk patients for MRSA colonization within 24 hours of admission. This retrospective study aims to determine whether the rate of MRSA BSIs has significantly decreased within the Scripps Health Organization in conjunction with this legislation. Positive MRSA bacteremia cultures were collected from five Scripps campuses (2007-2010, N=427) and subsequently classified as hospitalor community-associated. Student T tests and Chi-square tests were used to determine statistical differences between pre-legislation and post-legislation rates. Stepwise logistic regression was used to identify predictors for MRSA infection. Analysis revealed that while overall there was a reduction in community-associated MRSA bacteremia rates, there was not a significant reduction in hospitalassociated MRSA bacteremia rates. These findings suggest that active surveillance of high risk patients has not clearly succeeded in reducing the nosocomial spread of MRSA but may help direct antibiotic choices for new hospital admissions and prevent the development of BSI in these patients. Results from this study may be useful to inform legislative action, as well as the development of more effective control interventions.",2012,
Kernel Homotopy based sparse representation for object classification,"The l1 minimization problem (Lasso) is a basic and critical problem in sparse representation and its applications. Among the solutions, Homotopy is an efficient and effective algorithm. In this paper, we propose a novel kernel algorithm based on Homotopy (KHomotopy) to solve the Lasso problem in kernel space. Then we integrate it in the well known Sparse Representation based Classification (SRC) framework. The proposed method is applied to the object classification problem, and compared with other kernel SRC methods and kernel SVM. Experiments on the CalTech101 and the Flower 17 databases show that KHomotopy has the best overall performance in accuracy and speed, which outperforms both linear SRC and KSVM, and is better than or comparable to two existing kernel SRC algorithms.",2012,Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR2012)

Bayesian variable selection and estimation in semiparametric joint models of multivariate longitudinal and survival data.,"This paper presents a novel semiparametric joint model for multivariate longitudinal and survival data (SJMLS) by relaxing the normality assumption of the longitudinal outcomes, leaving the baseline hazard functions unspecified and allowing the history of the longitudinal response having an effect on the risk of dropout. Using Bayesian penalized splines to approximate the unspecified baseline hazard function and combining the Gibbs sampler and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, we propose a Bayesian Lasso (BLasso) method to simultaneously estimate unknown parameters and select important covariates in SJMLS. Simulation studies are conducted to investigate the finite sample performance of the proposed techniques.

A Suggestive Model For Rice Yield Prediction And Ideal Meteorological Conditions During Crisis,"The agriculture sector is the backbone of Indian economy. Seventy percent of population in India is dependent on agriculture for their livelihood. With the available resources and infrastructure villagers are able to produce the crop not to the fullest potential yield. In order to augment the efforts of farmers to get higher yields a predictive model was developed. This will help farmers by predicting the yield of the upcoming season by using machine learning and deep learning algorithms such as Deep Neural Network Regressor, Gaussian Process Regressor, Linear Regression and Lasso Regression. This can be done by understanding the relationship between factors that affect crop production (like area, seasonal monthly average temperature, seasonal monthly average humidity, seasonal monthly average rainfall, seasonal monthly average wind speed, seasonal monthly average UV index, seasonal monthly average sun hours, and seasonal monthly average pressure) and crop yield. Prediction will be performed on rice as it is one of the major crops produced in India. If the predicted values are substantially lower than the mean yield then by simulating the weather parameters maximum yield and profit can be obtained.",2019,International Journal of Scientific & Technology Research
Management and protection of peri-urban forests of three towns in Greece,"The satisfaction of continuous leisure demand in suburban forest requires a proper management of space so as on the one hand to provide better services to visitors and on the other hand to protect against excessive and improper use by guests. In the present study we investigated and analyzed the current situation of the suburban forests of Drama, Limni and Elassona and proposed the appropriate future management. The views of residents are reflected in primary research using a questionnaire (personal interview). The results focus, regardless of the region, to the multiple roles played by suburban forests for urban and suburban areas. The integration of suburban forests and especially of all the urban green as key elements of spatial planning and urban reconstruction of large and small urban centers, are the means that will create favorable conditions for future upgrading of suburban forests in order to sufficiently accomplish a modern triple role; productive, ecological and social.",2016,
Introduction: Contemporary Conditions and Diagrammatic Trajectory,"At the same time as a turn to the object, there has, in some recent continental philosophy, been a concomitant turn to, and renewal of interest in, the question of the subject.1 A return to philosophy as a speculative realm of enquiry (that is, to metaphysics), and a return to philosophy as a way of life. In fact, this is not necessarily a subject that is opposed to the object. It is not a subject that is barred from what Quentin Meillassoux calls the â€˜great outdoorsâ€™ (Meillassoux 2008b, p. 7). Rather, it is a subject that is itself part of that object, a finitude that is woven from the very fabric of the infinite. This is to suggest a continuum of sorts between the finite and infinite, and also to foreground the heterogeneity of forms (and times) that such a subject might take. In fact, it is to foreground subjectivity over and above a subject, when the latter is understood as a single homogenized entity. It is also to emphasize the processual nature of this subjectivity as always a work in progress: an ethical and aesthetic programme aimed at producing a certain autonomy contra the dominant technologies and logics of subjection of our present moment. We might say then that this subjectivity is both pragmatic and speculative in the sense that its production must be carried out in our contemporary world, but that it is not reducible to those lifestyle options that are typically on offer.",2012,
Degrees of freedom in lasso problems,"We derive the degrees of freedom of the lasso fit, placing no assumptions on the predictor matrix $X$. Like the well-known result of Zou, Hastie and Tibshirani [Ann. Statist. 35 (2007) 2173-2192], which gives the degrees of freedom of the lasso fit when $X$ has full column rank, we express our result in terms of the active set of a lasso solution. We extend this result to cover the degrees of freedom of the generalized lasso fit for an arbitrary predictor matrix $X$ (and an arbitrary penalty matrix $D$). Though our focus is degrees of freedom, we establish some intermediate results on the lasso and generalized lasso that may be interesting on their own.",2012,Annals of Statistics

"[Incidence, risk factors and management of pericardial effusion post radiofrequency catheter ablation in patients with atrial fibrillations].","OBJECTIVE
Pericardial effusion (PE) is a major complication of atrial fibrillation ablation (AFB). We analyzed the incidence, risk factors and managements of PE post AFB (radiofrequency catheter ablation).


METHODS
A total of 156 consecutive patients with AF [male 108, paroxysmal AF 114, (57.6 +/- 11.3) years], who underwent AFB guided by a three-dimensional mapping system (CARTO or CARTO-Merge, Biosense-Webster Inc., Diamond Bar, California) and a circular mapping catheter (Lasso, Biosense-Webster Inc., Diamond Bar, California), were included in this study. The ablation strategy included circumferential pulmonary veins isolation (CPVI), linear ablation and/or complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAEs) ablation. Electrophysiological data and vital signs of patients were recorded by a multiple physiological recorder (Prucka, GE Medical Systems) during ablation. Ablation process, sites, duration and other related factors were also recorded. Echocardiography and other examinations were performed for diagnosing and monitoring PE.


RESULTS
CPVI were achieved in all 156 patients. Incidence of PE was 10.3% (16/156) post AFB. One patient developed acute cardiac tamponade and emergency drainage of the pericardial effusion was performed through a median sternotomy and patient recovered without complications during the 18 months follow-up. The rest 15 PE patients with small PE received outpatient care and no invasive treatment was needed and PE disappeared after 3 months in 6 patients and after 6 months in 9 patients. Univariate analysis showed that the composition of gender (P < 0.01), ablation in coronary sinus (CS, P = 0.026), ablation of CFAEs (P = 0.037) and superior vena cava (SVC, P = 0.041) were risk factors for PE. Logistic regression analysis showed that female gender [beta = 3.594, exp (b) = 36.4, 95% confidence interval (CI): 4.2 - 312.1, P = 0.001] and ablation in CS [beta = 2.419, exp (b) = 11.2, 95% CI: 1.0 - 124.6, P = 0.049] were independent risk factors for PE post AFB.


CONCLUSIONS
PE is a common complication of AFB, female gender and ablation in CS were independent risk factors for PE. Most PE patients experienced spontaneous recovery but emergency treatment was needed for patient with cardiac tamponade.",2008,Zhonghua xin xue guan bing za zhi
Neutralizing antibodies obtained in a persistent immune response are effective against deleterious effects induced by the Thalassophryne nattereri fish venom.,"Thalassophryne nattereri envenoming represents a great cost to North and Northeast Brazilian communities in terms of public healths, leisure and tourism. Victims rapidally develop symptoms as pain, local swelling, erythema followed by intense necrosis that persist for long days. The aim of this work was tested the immune competence of neutralizing antibodies in pre-immunized mice against principal toxic activities induced by venom. During the primary antibody response in mice, an elevation of IgG antibody levels was only observed on day 28. After boosting, high antibody levels were detected between days 49 and 70, with a 12-fold increase in IgG level over control values at day 49. We confirmed the in vitro neutralizing capacity of T. nattereri anti-venom against toxic effects and thereafter we show that neutralizing antibodies obtained in a persistent immune response are more effective, inclusive against edematous reaction. After boosting during the secondary response mice with high antibody levels do not present any alterations in venule or arteriole after topical application of venom on cremaster muscle. In addition, CK activity diminished in these mice with high neutralizing antibody levels corroborating the attenuation of the myonecrotic effect by venom. In addition, we determined the presence of high IgG antibodies levels in patients 6 months after injury by T. nattereri. In conclusion, the presence of neutralizing antibodies against to T. nattereri venom in the serum of pre-immunized mice could change the outcome of lesion at site of posterior envenoming. Antigen-specific antibodies of high affinity in consequence to specific immune response, dependent of T lymphocyte activation, could minimize the symptoms of intense and immediate inflammatory reaction caused by T. nattereri venom. These finding prompt us to the possibility of development of immune therapeutic strategies using specific anti-venom as an efficient intervention for protecting human victims.",2007,Toxicon : official journal of the International Society on Toxinology
Critical Dynamics under the Vlassov-Poisson Equations: Critical Exponents and Scaling of the Distribution Function near the Point of a Marginal Stability,"Using direct integration of the Vlassov equation in configurational space, nonlinear dynamics of a model one-dimensional periodic self-gravitating system are investigated near the point of a marginal stability. The critical velocity dispersion Ïƒ, corresponding to a marginal stability of the Jeans mode with the least k, is assumed as the critical point. The peak amplitude of the Jeans mode computed in a run is assumed as the order parameter. In the neighborhood of the critical point, the dynamics can be described by a set of the power laws typical for a system undergoing a second-order phase transition. For the order parameter, this is A âˆ -Î¸Î², where Î² = 1.907 Â± 0.006 and Î¸ = (Ïƒ2 - Ïƒ)/Ïƒ 0. Under this accuracy, these critical exponents satisfy the equality Î³Â± = Î²(Î´ - 1). For a gravitating system, its existence is a direct consequence of scaling invariance of the distribution function at |Î¸| 1; i.e., f(Î»t, x, Î»v, Î»Î¸, Î»A0, Î»F1) = Î»f(t, x, v, Î¸, A0, F1). These critical exponents indicate a wide critical area where critical phenomena may determine macroscopic dynamics. The random external drive field of a small amplitude causes anomalous growth of the marginally stable Jeans perturbation into a spatially coherent structure.",2001,The Astrophysical Journal
[Functional disability in activities of daily living and instrumental or domestic activities of daily living in the elderly living at home in Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina Faso)].,"In sub-Saharan Africa, various studies have been conducted on severe disability in activities of daily living, instrumental or domestic activities. These studies have reported different rates without describing the social context for understanding their results. This study was conducted in Burkina Faso to fill the gaps in scientific information on disability in these areas. We conducted a cross-sectional descriptive study in Bobo-Dioulasso among the older population, aged 60 and above. Their functional status was evaluated using the Functional Autonomy Measurement System (SMAF). Data analysis was done with the help of Stata. A systematic random sample of 351 aging adults was interviewed. Moderate to severe functional disability or the need for supervision or assistance was present in 7% in activities of daily living and 86% in instrumental or domestic activities of daily living. This need for assistance varied according to the different activities or items in each domain. The proportions of disability found in this study are higher than those of previous studies that measured the often severe disabilities. All persons with disability claimed to have stable human resources which help them to manage their disabilities. The social context instrumental or domestic activities of daily living are divided by generation and/or by sex. That explains some results. With this division, it's inacceptable in some family that elders and/or old men do instrumental or domestic activities of daily living as prepare meals, do laundry, carry water to wash. The variation of this division from one family to another complicates the assessment of functional disability. To best manage elders disabilities, strategies must develop to: 1) retard the resignation of the family in care of its elderly in functional disability, 2) anticipate the preparation of formal social networks, public structures to support the elderly.",2015,Geriatrie et psychologie neuropsychiatrie du vieillissement
Surveys of Great Crested Grebes Podiceps cristatus and Other Waterbirds on the Kasenda Cluster of Crater Lakes in Western Uganda,"ABSTRACT The african subspecies of the Great Crested Grebe Podiceps cristatus infuscatus is limited to scattered populations in eastern and southern Africa. To evaluate their status in the Kasenda cluster of crater lakes in western Uganda in 2000, we visited 28 crater lakes, which include the only known sites for the species in Uganda. At each lake, we counted all waterbirds and recorded data on forest conditions of the crater walls and fishing activities. Deforestation of crater rims was severe; more than half of the craters had lost at least three quarters of their forest cover. Gill net fishing was observed at six of the lakes. Great Crested Grebes were observed at only one lake, although records from the 1990s document them on four other crater lakes in the area. These records include breeding on Lake Kyerabwato, inside Kibale National Park, in 1998. Given the small size of this isolated population, the future of great crested grebes in Uganda is highly uncertain. We recorded 30 waterbird species on these lakes; in addition to Great Crested Grebes, other species of conservation interest included White-Backed Duck Thalassornis leuconotus and Giant Kingfisher Ceryle maxima.",2003,
Extended adaptive Lasso for multi-class and multi-label feature selection,"Abstract Feature selection is a basic step and important task in applications of pattern recognition and machine learning. In this paper, we propose a new Extended Adaptive Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (EALasso) feature selection method for multi-class and multi-label learning problems. It preserves the oracle properties of identifying the correct subset model and having the optimal estimation accuracy. An iterative optimization algorithm, with theoretical proof of convergence, is proposed to solve the optimization problem. Experimental results on several real multi-class and multi-label data sets show that the proposed EALasso method outperforms many state-of-the-art feature selection methods for multi-class single-label classification as well as multi-class multi-label classification.",2019,Knowl.

CONE: Community Oriented Network Estimation Is a Versatile Framework for Inferring Population Structure in Large-Scale Sequencing Data,"Estimation of genetic population structure based on molecular markers is a common task in population genetics and ecology. We apply a generalized linear model with LASSO regularization to infer relationships between individuals and populations from molecular marker data. Specifically, we apply a neighborhood selection algorithm to infer population genetic structure and gene flow between populations. The resulting relationships are used to construct an individual-level population graph. Different network substructures known as communities are then dissociated from each other using a community detection algorithm. Inference of population structure using networks combines the good properties of: (i) network theory (broad collection of tools, including aesthetically pleasing visualization), (ii) principal component analysis (dimension reduction together with simple visual inspection), and (iii) model-based methods (e.g., ancestry coefficient estimates). We have named our process CONE (for community oriented network estimation). CONE has fewer restrictions than conventional assignment methods in that properties such as the number of subpopulations need not be fixed before the analysis and the sample may include close relatives or involve uneven sampling. Applying CONE on simulated data sets resulted in more accurate estimates of the true number of subpopulations than model-based methods, and provided comparable ancestry coefficient estimates. Inference of empirical data sets of teosinte single nucleotide polymorphism, bacterial disease outbreak, and the human genome diversity panel illustrate that population structures estimated with CONE are consistent with the earlier findings.",2017,G3: Genes|Genomes|Genetics
Self-Assembling Insurance Claim Models Using Regularized Regression and Machine Learning,"The lasso is applied in an attempt to automate the loss reserving problem. The regression form contained within the lasso is a GLM, and so that the model has all the versatility of that type of model, but the model selection is automated and the parameter coefficients for selected terms will not be the same. 
There are two applications presented, one to synthetic data in conventional triangular form, and another to real data.The secret of success in such an endeavor is the selection of the set of candidate basis functions for representation of the data set. Cross-validation is used for model selection. 
The lasso performs well in modelling, identifying known features in the synthetic data, and tracking them accurately. This is despite complexity in those features that would challenge, and possibly defeat, most loss reserving alternatives. In the case of real data, the lasso also succeeds in tracking features of the data that analysis of the data set over many years has rendered virtually known. 
A later section of the paper discusses the prediction error associated with a lasso-based loss reserve. It is seen that the procedure can be readily adapted to the estimation of parameter and process error, but can also estimate one component of model error. To the authors knowledge, no other loss reserving model in the literature does so.",2018,
A gradient descending solution to the LASSO criteria,"In this paper, we propose a new perspective to achieve sparseness via the winner-take-all principle for the linear kernel regression and classification tasks. We form the duality of the LASSO criteria, and transfer an /spl lscr//sub 1/ norm minimization to an /spl lscr//sub /spl infin// norm maximization problem. We introduce a novel winner-take-all neural network solution derived from gradient descending, which links the sparse representation and the competitive learning scheme. This scheme is a form of unsupervised learning in which each input pattern comes through learning, to be associated with the activity of one or at most a few neurons. However, the lateral interaction between neurons in the same layer is strictly preemptive in this model. This framework is applicable to a variety of problems, such as independent component analysis (ICA), feature selection, and data clustering.",2005,"Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2005."
Convex relaxation for low-dimensional representation: Phase transitions and limitations,"There is a growing interest in taking advantage of possible patterns and structures in data so as to extract the desired information and overcome the curse of dimensionality. In a wide range of applications, including computer vision, machine learning, medical imaging, and social networks, the signal that gives rise to the observations can be modeled to be approximately sparse and exploiting this fact can be very beneficial. This has led to an immense interest in the problem of efficiently reconstructing a sparse signal from limited linear observations. More recently, low-rank approximation techniques have become prominent tools to approach problems arising in machine learning, system identification and quantum tomography. In sparse and low-rank estimation problems, the challenge is the inherent intractability of the objective function, and one needs efficient methods to capture the low-dimensionality of these models. Convex optimization is often a promising tool to attack such problems. An intractable problem with a combinatorial objective can often be ""relaxed"" to obtain a tractable but almost as powerful convex optimization problem. This dissertation studies convex optimization techniques that can take advantage of low-dimensional representations of the underlying high-dimensional data. We provide provable guarantees that ensure that the proposed algorithms will succeed under reasonable conditions, and answer questions of the following flavor: For a given number of measurements, can we reliably estimate the true signal? If so, how good is the reconstruction as a function of the model parameters? More specifically, i) Focusing on linear inverse problems, we generalize the classical error bounds known for the least-squares technique to the lasso formulation, which incorporates the signal model. ii) We show that intuitive convex approaches do not perform as well as expected when it comes to signals that have multiple low-dimensional structures simultaneously. iii) Finally, we propose convex relaxations for the graph clustering problem and give sharp performance guarantees for a family of graphs arising from the so-called stochastic block model. We pay particular attention to the following aspects. For i) and ii), we aim to provide a general geometric framework, in which the results on sparse and low-rank estimation can be obtained as special cases. For i) and iii), we investigate the precise performance characterization, which yields the right constants in our bounds and the true dependence between the problem parameters.",2015,

Introducing a Comprehensive Framework to Measure Spike-LFP Coupling,"Measuring the coupling of single neuron's spiking activities to the local field potentials (LFPs) is a method to investigate neuronal synchronization. The most important synchronization measures are phase locking value (PLV), spike field coherence (SFC), pairwise phase consistency (PPC), and spike-triggered correlation matrix synchronization (SCMS). Synchronization is generally quantified using the PLV and SFC. PLV and SFC methods are either biased on the spike rates or the number of trials. To resolve these problems the PPC measure has been introduced. However, there are some shortcomings associated with the PPC measure which is unbiased only for very high spike rates. However evaluating spike-LFP phase coupling (SPC) for short trials or low number of spikes is a challenge in many studies. Lastly, SCMS measures the correlation in terms of phase in regions around the spikes inclusive of the non-spiking events which is the major difference between SCMS and SPC. This study proposes a new framework for predicting a more reliable SPC by modeling and introducing appropriate machine learning algorithms namely least squares, Lasso, and neural networks algorithms where through an initial trend of the spike rates, the ideal SPC is predicted for neurons with low spike rates. Furthermore, comparing the performance of these three algorithms shows that the least squares approach provided the best performance with a correlation of 0.99214 and R 2 of 0.9563 in the training phase, and correlation of 0.95969 and R 2 of 0.8842 in the test phase. Hence, the results show that the proposed framework significantly enhances the accuracy and provides a bias-free basis for small number of spikes for SPC as compared to the conventional methods such as PLV method. As such, it has the general ability to correct for the bias on the number of spike rates.",2018,Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience
Nearly Optimal Private LASSO,"We present a nearly optimal differentially private version of the well known LASSO estimator. Our algorithm provides privacy protection with respect to each training example. The excess risk of our algorithm, compared to the non-private version, is O(1/n2/3), assuming all the input data has bounded lâˆž norm. This is the first differentially private algorithm that achieves such a bound without the polynomial dependence on p under no additional assumptions on the design matrix. In addition, we show that this error bound is nearly optimal amongst all differentially private algorithms.",2015,
Group-sparse regression using the covariance fitting criterion,"A generalization of the covariance fitting criteria, for grouped variables, is presented.An hyperparameter-free analogue to the SPICE method is proposed for grouped variables, termed group-SPICE.The connection between group-SPICE and the group-LASSO (for both dense and sparse groups) is established.An efficient iterative implementation is presented for both homoscedastic and heteroscedastic noise.Group-SPICE is verified for synthetic data, as well as applied to the multi-pitch estimation problem. In this work, we present a novel formulation for efficient estimation of group-sparse regression problems. By relaxing a covariance fitting criteria commonly used in array signal processing, we derive a generalization of the recent SPICE method for grouped variables. Such a formulation circumvents cumbersome model order estimation, while being inherently hyperparameter-free. We derive an implementation which iteratively decomposes into a series of convex optimization problems, each being solvable in closed-form. Furthermore, we show the connection between the proposed estimator and the class of LASSO-type estimators, where a dictionary-dependent regularization level is inherently set by the covariance fitting criteria. We also show how the proposed estimator may be used to form group-sparse estimates for sparse groups, as well as validating its robustness against coherency in the dictionary, i.e., the case of overlapping dictionary groups. Numerical results show preferable estimation performance, on par with a group-LASSO bestowed with oracle regularization, and well exceeding comparable greedy estimation methods.",2017,Signal Process.
Electrochemical Measurements of the Electronic Density of States,"The electronic density of states of metal oxides can in many cases be measured by electrochemical techniques [1], such as chronopotentiometry or impedance spectroscopy. When small ions such as protons or Li ions are intercalated into a material, which is used as the working electrode in an electrochemical cell, electrons must be inserted from the back contact to maintain charge neutrality. These electrons will enter into previously unoccupied states and the Fermi level will shift upwards in energy as intercalation proceeds. Provided that the rigid band approximation holds, measuring the inserted charge during this process will give an image of the electronic densityof states over 1 to 2 eV from the band edge.We have compared the so called electrochemical density of states obtained by this method to density functional calculations for a number of oxides. The electrochemical technique is able to give results in qualitative agreement with calculations. We have studied a number of metal oxides such as WO3, TiO2, V2O5, Sb:SnO2, In:SnO2, IrO2 as well as some NiO based coatings.There are a number of questions that need to be better understood in order to make the technique fully quantitative, though. A limitation is that the number of ions that can be intercalated in a given material is restricted. In addition, the ions do not distribute uniformly in the coating but probably exhibit a gradient in concentration, due to slow kinetics of the process. In addition, the validity of the rigid band approximation is largely an open question. The technique will be useful for screening the density of states of a large amount of coatings in the laboratory. Then interesting materials and specimen can be selected for further studies by advanced techniques, such as photoelectron or X-ray spectroscopies at synchrotron facilities.References1. M. Stromme, R.

MSC-clustering and forward stepwise regression for virtual metrology in highly correlated input spaces,"Increasingly semiconductor manufacturers are exploring opportunities for virtual metrology (VM) enabled process monitoring and control as a means of reducing non-value added metrology and achieving ever more demanding wafer fabrication tolerances. However, developing robust, reliable and interpretable VM models can be very challenging due to the highly correlated input space often associated with the underpinning data sets. A particularly pertinent example is etch rate prediction of plasma etch processes from multichannel optical emission spectroscopy data. This paper proposes a novel input-clustering based forward stepwise regression methodology for VM model building in such highly correlated input spaces. Max Separation Clustering (MSC) is employed as a pre-processing step to identify a reduced srt of well-conditioned, representative variables that can then be used as inputs to state-of-the-art model building techniques such as Forward Selection Regression (FSR), Ridge regression, LASSO and Forward Selection Ridge Regression (FCRR). The methodology is validated on a benchmark semiconductor plasma etch dataset and the results obtained are compared with those achieved when the state-of-art approaches are applied directly to the data without the MSC pre-processing step. Significant performance improvements are observed when MSC is combined with FSR (13%) and FSRR (8.5%), but not with Ridge Regression (-1%) or LASSO (-32%). The optimal VM results are obtained using the MSC-FSR and MSC-FSRR generated models.",2012,2012 SEMI Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing Conference

The genome analysis of Oleiphilus messinensis ME102 (DSM 13489T) reveals backgrounds of its obligate alkane-devouring marine lifestyle,"Marine bacterium Oleiphilus messinensis ME102 (DSM 13489T) isolated from the sediments of the harbor of Messina (Italy) is a member of the order Oceanospirillales, class Gammaproteobacteria, representing the physiological group of marine obligate hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria (OHCB) alongside the members of the genera Alcanivorax, Oleispira, Thalassolituus, Cycloclasticus and Neptunomonas. These organisms play a crucial role in the natural environmental cleanup in marine systems. Despite having the largest genome (6.379.281bp) among OHCB, O. messinensis exhibits a very narrow substrate profile. The alkane metabolism is pre-determined by three loci encoding for two P450 family monooxygenases, one of which formed a cassette with ferredoxin and alcohol dehydrogenase encoding genes and alkane monoxygenase (AlkB) gene clustered with two genes for rubredoxins and NAD+-dependent rubredoxin reductase. Its genome contains the largest numbers of genomic islands (15) and mobile genetic elements (140), as compared with more streamlined genomes of its OHCB counterparts. Among hydrocarbon-degrading Oceanospirillales, O. messinensis encodes the largest array of proteins involved in the signal transduction for sensing and responding to the environmental stimuli (345 vs 170 in Oleispira antarctica, the bacterium with the second highest number). This must be an important trait to adapt to the conditions in marine sediments with a high physico-chemical patchiness and heterogeneity as compared to those in the water column.",2017,Marine Genomics
A Short Note on Improved ROSETA,This note presents a more efficient formulation of the robust online subspace estimation and tracking algorithm (ROSETA) that is capable of identifying and tracking a time-varying low dimensional subspace from incomplete measurements and in the presence of sparse outliers. The algorithm minimizes a robust l1 norm cost function between the observed measurements and their projection onto the estimated subspace. The projection coefficients and sparse outliers are computed using a LASSO solver and the subspace estimate is updated using a proximal point iteration with adaptive parameter selection.,2017,ArXiv
Estimation of physiological smog symptom potential from chemical reactivity of hydrocarbons.,"Abstract Eye irritation, a photochemical smog symptom, depends both on the rate of chemical reaction of hydrocarbons in air in the presence of nitrogen oxides, and the irritation potential of the lachrymators formed. Using data reported by Heuss and Glasson (1968), it has been verified that eye irritation can be successfully correlated with chemical measurement by the equation: relative eye irritation reactivity = relative chemical reactivity Ã— biological effect factor. The correlation is highly significant with sample correlation coefficient greater than +0.99. The biological effect factors have distinct physical significance and parameters derived from one set of hydrocarbons can be used successfully to predict the eye irritation reactivity of other hydrocarbons. It is expected that other physiological symptoms can be similarly correlated with chemical reactivity. Therefore, relative chemical reactivity should be chosen as the basic reactivity scale for hydrocarbons with which all smog symptoms can be related by the corresponding biological effect factors.",1973,Atmospheric environment
Shrinkage Estimation For Nearly Singular Designs,"Shrinkage estimation procedures such as ridge regression and the lasso have been proposed for stabilizing estimation in linear models when high collinearity exists in the design. In this paper, we consider asymptotic properties of shrinkage esti mators in the case of ""nearly singular"" designs.",2008,Econometric Theory
Two-Dimensional Resource Pattern Optimization for Interference Avoidance in Heterogeneous Networks,"Interference management for heterogeneous networks (HetNets) has been a research highlight in recent years; one effective method is interference avoidance by resource allocation. Typical resource-allocation methods are arranging orthogonal resources between a macrocell and femtocells, such as in the frequency domain in intercell interference coordination (ICIC) or in the time domain in enhanced ICIC (eICIC). However, wireless channels experience timeâ€“frequency fading appealing for a 2-D resource-allocation scheme. By optimizing the resource pattern based on variable channel conditions and by introducing a group lasso term, our scheme exploits channel variations in both the time and frequency domains and, in addition, avoids the interference. By grouping the resources in our optimization model, our scheme is flexible and robust against heavy bursty traffic. It is also lightweight in terms of coordination overhead and is completely distributed, making it suitable for a standard Long-Term Evolution (LTE) procedure. Extensive simulations investigate the effect of the coordination period and the group number on different performance metrics and the effectiveness of our proposed method compared with sole frequency-domain and time-domain resource-allocation approaches.",2015,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology
