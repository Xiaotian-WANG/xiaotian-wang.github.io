"Best Subset, Forward Stepwise, or Lasso? Analysis and Recommendations Based on Extensive Comparisons","In exciting new work, Bertsimas et al. (2016) showed that the classical best-subset selection problem in regression modeling can be formulated as a mixed integer optimization (MIO) problem. Using recent advances in MIO algorithms, they demonstrated that bestsubset selection can now be solved at much larger problem sizes than what was thought possible in the statistics community. They presented empirical comparisons of best-subset with other popular variable selection procedures, in particular, the lasso and forward-stepwise selection. Surprisingly (to us), their simulations suggested that best subset consistently outperformed both methods in terms of prediction accuracy. Here we present an expanded set of simulations to shed more light on these comparisons. The summary is roughly as follows: â€¢ neither best subset nor the lasso uniformly dominate the other, with best Depts of Statistics and Biomedical Data Science, Stanford University (e-mail: hastie@stanford.edu; tibs@stanford.edu).

Abstract 3387: A complete workflow for high throughput isolation of serum microRNAs and downstream analysis by qRT-PCR: application to cancer biomarker discovery,"Biomarkers have become invaluable tools in the clinical space for cancer detection, diagnosis, patient prognosis and treatment selection. An ideal biomarker should be easily assayed with minimally invasive medical procedures but possess high sensitivity and specificity. Although many candidate biomarkers for various diseases have been proposed in the literature, very few have made their way to clinical use, and for certain types of cancer there are no reliable biomarker options. The use of prostate specific antigen (PSA) has led to a dramatic increase in the diagnosis of prostate cancer - over 230,000 new cases in 2014. However, most of these cases are of low risk disease that is unlikely to cause significant morbidity and mortality, leading to the accepted notion that prostate cancer is overdiagnosed. On the other hand, while it is a sensitive test, less than Â¼ of patients undergoing a prostate biopsy based on PSA testing are actually found to have the disease. The identification of biomarkers that are more senstitive and specific predictors for the presence of prostate cancer, as well as for the aggressiveness of the disease, could decrease the complications and morbidity related to prostate biopsies and definitive treatment. The circulating miRNA in blood could potentially fill this void, providing biomarkers suitable for real-time detection and application to the management of prostate cancer patients. The main advantages of miRNAs versus longer molecules (mRNA, lncRNA) include: (i) smaller number of sequences The objective of this project was to develop a set of reagents and tools for efficient recovery and analysis of circulating miRNAs. Our team has built a complete workflow to provide: (1) high throughput isolation of total serum RNA using a new MagMax TM mirVana TM reagent kit for the KingFisher TM Flex and Duo instruments, and (2) downstream analysis of microRNA profiles by qRT-PCR using next generation TaqManÂ® microRNA assays. The effectiveness of this workflow is exemplified by analysis of a panel of miRNAs in samples derived from serum of patients with metastatic prostate cancer versus control groups. Following this fast and easy workflow suitable for serum and other body fluids, disease-specific RNA signatures can be identified and used as biomarkers.

SÃ©lection de variables pour des processus ponctuels spatiaux,"Les applications recentes telles que les bases de donnees forestieres impliquent des observations de donnees spatiales associees a l'observation de nombreuses covariables spatiales. Nous considerons dans cette these le probleme de l'estimation d'une forme parametrique de la fonction d'intensite dans un tel contexte. Cette these developpe les procedures de selection des variables et donne des garanties quant a leur validite. En particulier, nous proposons deux approches differentes pour la selection de variables : les methodes de type lasso et les procedures de type Selecteur de Dantzig. Pour les methodes envisageant les techniques de type lasso, nous derivons les proprietes asymptotiques des estimations obtenues par les fontions d'estimation derivees par les vraisemblances de la Poisson et de la regression logistique penalisees par une grande classe de penalites. Nous prouvons que les estimations obtenues par de ces procedures satisfont la consistance, sparsite et la normalite asymptotique. Pour la partie selecteur de Dantzig, nous developpons une version modifiee du selecteur de Dantzig, que nous appelons le selecteur Dantzig lineaire adaptatif (ALDS), pour obtenir les estimations d'intensite. Plus precisement, les estimations ALDS sont definies comme la solution a un probleme d'optimisation qui minimise la somme des coefficients des estimations soumises a une approximation lineaire du vecteur score comme une contrainte. Nous constatons que les estimations obtenues par de ces methodes ont des proprietes asymptotiques semblables a celles proposees precedemment a l'aide de methode regularisation du lasso adaptatif. Nous etudions les aspects computationnels des methodes developpees en utilisant les procedures de type lasso et de type Selector Dantzig. Nous etablissons des liens entre l'estimation de l'intensite des processus ponctuels spatiaux et les modeles lineaires generalises (GLM), donc nous n'avons qu'a traiter les procedures de la selection des variables pour les GLM. Ainsi, des procedures de calcul plus faciles sont implementees et un algorithme informatique rapide est propose. Des etudes de simulation sont menees pour evaluer les performances des echantillons finis des estimations de chacune des deux approches proposees. Enfin, nos methodes sont appliquees pour modeliser les emplacements spatiaux, une espece d'arbre dans la foret observee avec un grand nombre de facteurs environnementaux.",2017,
Estimation of a large-scale generalized Volterra model for neural ensembles with group lasso and local coordinate descent,"Estimation of neural models based on observed spike timing faces challenges as the amount of recorded units increases, especially when identifying detailed model features. Given that neural regions are generally sparsely connected, input selection is a critical step in model estimation but oftentimes computationally and theoretically challenging. In this paper, we detail an efficient methodology for estimating a sparse, nonlinear dynamical multiple-input, single-output model (MISO) applicable to large-scale (n > 50) single-unit recorded activity. The main contribution of this paper is the complete implementation of a principled group-lasso and local coordinate descent (LCD) algorithm into a generalized Volterra model (GVM) framework to achieve efficient sparse model estimation. Input selection is achieved with group-lasso by simultaneously selecting groups of parameters that are associated with each input. LCD yields efficient computation as the amount of inputs and parameters increase. We investigate and validate the performance of this estimation procedure with the application to a 64 input simulated model.",2015,2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)
Systematic assessment of prescribed medications and short-term risk of myocardial infarction â€“ a pharmacopeia-wide association study from Norway and Sweden,"Wholesale, unbiased assessment of Scandinavian electronic health-care databases offer a unique opportunity to reveal potentially important undiscovered drug side effects. We examined the short-term risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) associated with drugs prescribed in Norway or Sweden. We identified 24,584 and 97,068 AMI patients via the patient- and the cause-of-death registers and linked to prescription databases in Norway (2004â€“2014) and Sweden (2005â€“2014), respectively. A case-crossover design was used to compare the drugs dispensed 1â€“7 days before the date of AMI diagnosis with 15â€“21 daysâ€™ time -window for all the drug individually while controlling the receipt of other drugs. A BOLASSO approach was used to select drugs that acutely either increase or decrease the apparent risk of AMI. We found 48 drugs to be associated with AMI in both countries. Some antithrombotics, antibiotics, opioid analgesics, adrenergics, proton-pump inhibitors, nitroglycerin, diazepam, metoclopramide, acetylcysteine were associated with higher risk for AMI; whereas angiotensin-II-antagonists, calcium-channel blockers, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors, allopurinol, mometasone, metformin, simvastatin, levothyroxine were inversely associated. The results were generally robust in different sensitivity analyses. This study confirms previous findings for certain drugs. Based on the known effects or indications, some other associations could be anticipated. However, inverse associations of hydroxocobalamin, levothyroxine and mometasone were unexpected and needs further investigation. This pharmacopeia-wide association study demonstrates the feasibility of a systematic, unbiased approach to pharmacological triggers of AMI and other diseases with acute, identifiable onsets.",2019,Scientific Reports

Sparsity Pattern Recovery in Compressed Sensing - eScholarship,"The problem of recovering sparse signals from a limited number of measurements is now ubiquitous in signal processing, statistics, and machine learning. A natural question of fundamental interest is that of what can and cannot be recovered in the presence of noise. This thesis provides a sharp characterization for the task of sparsity pattern recovery (also known as support recovery). Using tools from information theory, we find a sharp separation into two problem regimes -- one in which the problem is fundamentally noise-limited, and a more interesting one in which the problem is limited by the behavior of the sparse components themselves. This analysis allows us to identify settings where existing computationally efficient algorithms, such as the LASSO or approximate message passing, are optimal as well as other settings where these algorithms are highly suboptimal. We compare our results to predictions of phase transitions made via the powerful but heuristic replica method, and find that our rigorous bounds confirm some of these predictions.The remainder of the thesis explores extensions of our bounds to various scenarios. We consider specially structured sampling matrices and show how such additional structure can make a key difference, analogous to the role of diversity in wireless communications. Finally, we illustrate how the new bounding techniques introduced in this thesis can be used to establish information-theoretic secrecy results for certain communication channel models that involve eavesdroppers.",2011,

Effects of microbial activity and electron shuttles on the reduction of U ( VI ) under sulfidogenic conditions,"Crystalline rocks record critical information about the magnitude and rates of geodynamic processes. Important factors such as: how deep; how hot; how fast; and for how long are all in some way encoded in the mineral assemblages, mineral compositions and microstructures. Our ability to estimate metamorphic pressureâ€“temperature (P-T) conditions has improved markedly with the increased availability of thermodynamic data for both simple and complex solidsolution phases, internally-consistent thermodynamic datasets and powerful computer programs to manipulate this data for a variety of equilibrium calculations. An increasingly popular tool is the single composition P-T section (commonly termed pseudosection) which allows rapid determination of mineral assemblages, compositions and their modal amounts for a given bulk composition within a specified P-T window. Unfortunately, with the increasing popularity has come an increasing disregard for the fact that a rock in equilibrium can only define a single point on such a diagram and that P-T paths, interpreted due to compositional zoning, inclusion suites and reaction textures, cannot be reliably indicated on the same, single pseudosection. Fortunately, the solution to this dilemma already exists. It is possible to model the consequences of bulk compositional fractionation along a P-Tpath and even to define local bulk chemical sub-domains (e.g. for a single inclusion or between two specific grains). Conventional geothermobarometry, typically utilising standardised formulations of exchange, net transfer or solvus reactions, is only of limited, indicative use. However, if one is confident of having identified a preserved equilibrium assemblage, and assuming that the compositions of the phases have not been subsequently modified, the same conventional thermobarometric reactions can be determined with thorough consideration of the Pand Tdependence of thermodynamic parameters, including activities, with the internally consistent data. Rocks in perfect (metastable) equilibrium are ideal for studying by a single pseudosection but of zero use for determining P-T-time paths. It is only by the combination of petrography, careful microanalysis and thoughtful application of various equilibrium thermodynamic tools, including pseudosections, that we will advance to a better quantification of, and thus also ability to model and predict, geodynamic processes.

An Asynchronous Distributed Proximal Gradient Method for Composite Convex Optimization,"We propose a distributed first-order augmented Lagrangian (DFAL) algorithm to minimize the sum of composite convex functions, where each term in the sum is a private cost function belonging to a node, and only nodes connected by an edge can directly communicate with each other. This optimization model abstracts a number of applications in distributed sensing and machine learning. We show that any limit point of DFAL iterates is optimal; and for any e < 0, an e-optimal and e-feasible solution can be computed within O(log(e-1)) DFAL iterations, which require O(Ïˆmax1.5/dmin e-1) proximal gradient computations and communications per node in total, where Ïˆmax denotes the largest eigenvalue of the graph Laplacian, and dmin is the minimum degree of the graph. We also propose an asynchronous version of DFAL by incorporating randomized block coordinate descent methods; and demonstrate the efficiency of DFAL on large scale sparse-group LASSO problems.",2015,
Compositional abstraction refinement for control synthesis under lasso-shaped specifications,"This paper presents a compositional approach to specification-guided abstraction refinement for control synthesis of a nonlinear system associated with a method to over-approximate its reachable sets. The control specification consists in following a lasso-shaped sequence of regions of the state space. The dynamics are decomposed into subsystems with partial control, partial state observation and possible overlaps between their respective observed state spaces. A finite abstraction is created for each subsystem through a refinement procedure, which starts from a coarse partition of the state space and then proceeds backwards on the lasso sequence to iteratively split the elements of the partition whose coarseness prevents the satisfaction of the specification. The composition of the local controllers obtained for each subsystem is proved to enforce the desired specification on the original system. This approach is illustrated in a nonlinear numerical example.",2017,2017 American Control Conference (ACC)

La legitimidad social de las instituciones de justicia penal,"En las ultimas decadas, se ha incrementado considerablemente el interes de la Criminologia por el estudio de las actitudes hacia las autoridades del sistema penal. En este sentido, el grueso de la literatura ha centrado su atencion en aquellos factores que afectan a la legitimidad social de instituciones como la policia o los tribunales. 
 
La legitimidad del sistema penal y/o sus instituciones es un rasgo fundamental en lassociedades democraticas, porque expresa la 
 creencia en la validez de su autoridad por parte de un numero relevante de los miembros de la sociedad. Hablar de legitimacion y deslegitimacion, es hablar de procesos de modificacion de las formas de percibir relaciones de influencia con esaautoridad; mediante los cuales esta obtiene o pierde el consenso que asegura la obediencia habitual de los ciudadanos que se encuentran vinculados a su poder. Para poder afirmar que una autoridad es socialmente legitima, es preciso que los ciudadanos perciban que comparten valores con ella, que sientan afinidad moral. 
 
Considerando que en Espana apenas contamos con evidencia empirica al respecto, el presente trabajo constituye una primera aproximacion exploratoria al objeto de estudio. Como parte de una investigacion mas amplia cuyo objetivo es avanzar en la medicion e identificacion de los factores explicativos de la legitimad social de las instituciones del sistema penal, se presentan los resultados de un pase piloto realizado con una muestra de 100 individuos. 
 
Dos ideas clave han canalizado este trabajo: 
la primera es ahondar en el significado que para los 
encuestados tienen algunos conceptos clave, como legitimidad o justicia procedimental, y la segunda es conocer que factores se encuentran relacionados con el sentimiento de afinidad moral con las instituciones de justicia penal.",2017,
A New Method for Distal Repositioning of a Misplaced Esophageal Stent,"Figure 1 The endoscope is inserted through the distal end of Several techniques for managing migrated and misplaced self-expanding esophageal metal stents have been described.1--5 However, most of these techniques apply only when there is distal stent dislodgment. When there is proximal stent migration or misplacement, and unless there is a lasso at the distal flange, trying to reposition the stent distally through the stenotic tumor can be challenging. Although it may be tried by grasping distal tines with forceps or inflating a dilating balloon within the stent and applying gentle pressure, it seldom results. We herein report an endoscopic approach for an easy and safe reposition of proximal dislodged esophageal metal stents that, as far as we are aware, was never described before. The stent is removed by grasping the lasso on the proximal end of the stent with an alligator jaw grasping forceps. Outside the patient, the lasso is released and the stent is turned upside down. The endoscope is then introduced through the distal end of the stent until the proximal end, where the lasso is re-grasped by the forceps and pulled back, allowing the upper flange of the stent to collapse over the tip of the endoscope (Fig. 1). The body of the stent is generously lubricated with aqueous jelly and stretched along the endoscope. The patient is reintubated with gently passage of the endoscope and the stent through the pharynx",2015,GE Portuguese Journal of Gastroenterology

Chapter 7.

However, on a more conceptual level, acronyms are often highly associated with objects or ideas that are not explicitly contained in the components of the acronym itself (e.g., CD is commonly associated with music). Which meaning is more accessible? The literal (component) meaning (e.g., disc) or the conceptual (associate) meaning (e.g., music)? Does the accessibility of either or both of those two meanings, literal-component meaning and the conceptualassociate, change over time? What happens when acronyms are processed as letter strings rather than lexical units? Is the accessibility of their literalcomponents or conceptual-associate attenuated? This chapter describes a series of six laboratory experiments conducted to answer these questions.",2011,
Using the contradiction paradigm to assess ageism,"Abstract Ageism is an important topic in our society, considering the burgeoning older adult population. Ageism is often measured using explicit questionnaires; however, given the impact of social desirability, implicit measures of ageism have been developed. In this study, the contradiction paradigm, an implicit measure of stereotypes (Lassonde, under review) was used to measure age-related stereotypes in passages describing older adults. Participants read passages with target sentences more slowly when these sentences described behaviors that were inconsistent rather than consistent with age-related stereotypes. Participants also completed a series of self-report questionnaires measuring ageism. Results demonstrated that reading times using the contradiction paradigm were not related to outcomes on the self-report questionnaires. A comparison of the contradiction paradigm to a social desirability scale revealed that it was not vulnerable to social desirability. This confirms the contradiction paradigm's use as an implicit measure of age-related stereotypes. Although there is no clear relation between the contradiction paradigm and popular explicit measures, a next important step would be to determine the point in which implicit knowledge and intentional behavioral responses interact.",2012,Journal of Aging Studies
Glassomer-Processing Fused Silica Glass Like a Polymer.,"Fused silica glass is one of the most important high-performance materials for scientific research, industry, and society. However due to its high chemical and thermal resistance as well as high hardness, fused silica glass is notoriously difficult to structure. This work introduces Glassomer, a solid nanocomposite, which can be structured using polymer molding and subtractive technologies at submicrometer resolution. After polymer processing Glassomer is turned into optical grade fused silica glass during a final heat treatment. The resulting glass has the same optical transparency as commercial fused silica and a smooth surface with a roughness of a few nanometers. This work makes high-performance fused silica glass components accessible to high-throughput fabrication technologies and will enable numerous optical, photonic and medical applications in science and industry.",2018,Advanced materials
Composition and Functional Characterization of Microbiome Associated with Mucus of the Coral Fungia echinata Collected from Andaman Sea,"This study describes the community composition and functions of the microbiome associated with the mucus of the coral Fungia echinata based on metagenomic approach. Metagenome sequence data showed a dominance of the class Gammaproteobacteria followed by Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, Flavobacteriia, Bacilli, and Clostridia. At the order level, the most abundant groups were Pseudomonadales, Oceanospirillales, Alteromonadales, and Rhodobacterales. The genus Psychrobacter was the most predominant followed by Thalassolituus and Cobetia, although other genera were also present, such as Sulfitobacter, Pseudoalteromonas, Oleispira, Halomonas, Oceanobacter, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, Vibrio, and Marinobacter. The metabolic profile of the bacterial community displayed high prevalence of genes associated with core-housekeeping processes, such as carbohydrates, amino acids, proteins, and nucleic acid metabolism. Further, high abundance of genes coding for DNA replication and repair, stress response, and virulence factors in the metagenome suggested acquisition of specific environmental adaptation by the microbiota. Comparative analysis with other coral metagenome exhibits marked differences at the taxonomical and functional level. This study suggests the bacterial community compositions are influenced by the specific coral micro-niche and the oligotrophic marine environment.",2016,Frontiers in Microbiology
The impact of entrepreneurship orientation on project performance: A machine learning approach,"Abstract Recent studies in project management have shown the important role of entrepreneurship orientation of the individuals in project performance. Although identifying the role of entrepreneurship orientation as a critical success factor in project performance has been considered as an important issue, it is also important to develop a measurement system for predicting performance based on the degree of an individual's entrepreneurial orientation. In this study, we use predictive analytics by proposing a machine learning approach to predict individuals' project performance based on measures of several aspects of entrepreneurial orientation and entrepreneurial attitude of the individuals. We investigated this relationship using a sample of 185 observations and a range of machine learning algorithms including lasso, ridge, support vector machines, neural networks, and random forest. Our results showed that the best method for predicting project performance is lasso. After identifying the best predictive model, we then used the Bayesian Information Criterion and the Akaike Information Criterion to identify the most significant factors. Our results identify all three aspects of entrepreneurial attitude (social self-efficacy, appearance self-efficacy, and comparativeness) and one aspect of entrepreneurial orientation (proactiveness) as the most important factors. This study contributes to the relationship between entrepreneurship skills and project performance and provides insights into the application of emerging tools in data science and machine learning in operations management and project management research.",2020,International Journal of Production Economics
Endogenous Irritants as Factors in Eczema and in Other Dermatoses: Preliminary Report,"The relationship between intestinal disorders and eczema has been the subject of much controversy among dermatologists. Eczemas associated with certain metabolic causes, to wit, ""diabetic eczema,"" were recognized long ago, and more recently those associated with low sugar tolerance, have been recognized, as pointed out by McGlasson 1 and Ayers 2 in the United States and Campbell 3 in Canada. The work of Bloch 4 and others on the factor of external irritation has tended to swing the pendulum too far away from internal causes. The undoubted cases of eczema reported by Wise and Ramirez 5 and by others showed definitely that eczema, particularly chronic, itchy, lichenified types, could be due to a food sensitization in an allergic person. Intestinal toxins as possible causes have been given variable consideration in textbooks on dermatology.

[JAK2/STAT3 signal pathway mediating curcumin in cartilage cell metabolism of osteoarthritis].,"OBJECTIVE
To observe influence of JAK2/STAT3 signal pathway mediating curcumin in cartilage cell metabolism of osteoarthritis and mitochondria oxidative stress resistance;also explore the role of JAK2/STAT3 signal pathway and effect of curcumin in this process.


METHODS
Fifteen male SPF C57BL/6 rats rweighted from 10.05 to 15.00 g with an average of 12.80 g were collected and randomly divided into control group, OA group(modeled as OA by Glasson SS), curcumin with OA group (100 mg/kg curcumin were performed intraperitoneal injection every day based on OA group), 5 rats in each group. Rats were taken off the neck after 4 weeks, morphologic change were observed, specimens changes were observed by histochemical methods;p-JAK2, p-STAT3 and Bax protein expression were detected by Western blot;At the same time, the changes of mitochondria oxidative stress index such as succinate dehydrogenase(SDH) and cytochrome C oxydase(COX) in each group were detected.


RESULTS
After 4 weeks, cartilage tissue showed translucent shape, no swelling and congestion, the number of cartilage cell increased, nuclei liked oval, chromatin arranged uniform in control group;in curcumin with OA group, joint showed slightly swelling without congestion, the formation of cartilage cell was regular, and number of cell decreased;while in OA group, the surface of joint was roughness with mild damage, cell arrangement was a bit disorder, nuclear was disappeared under vision and dyeing was uneven. Compared with control group, p-JAK2, p-STAT3 protein expression was decreased in OA and curcumin with OA group(P<0.05), Bax protein expression was increased (P<0.05), SDA and COX protein expression were reduced (P<0.05). Compared with OA group, p-JAK2, p-STAT3 protein expression was increased in curcumin with OA, Bax protein expression was decreased (P<0.05), SDA and COX protein expression were increased (P<0.05), and had statistical differences among three groups.


CONCLUSIONS
JAK2/STAT3 signal pathway is closely associated with pathology course of osteoarthritis, curcumin could stimulate JAK2/STAT3 signal pathway and promote mitochondria oxidative stress. It could obviously relieve degeneration of articular cartilage and slow lower progress of OA.",2016,Zhongguo gu shang = China journal of orthopaedics and traumatology

Generalized Time-Updating Sparse Covariance-Based Spectral Estimation,"Recently, the time-updating <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$q$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-norm sparse covariance-based estimator (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$q$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-SPICE) was developed for online spectral estimation of stationary signals. In this work, this development is furthered to deal with non-stationary signals. By introducing a weighting matrix defined by a forgetting factor, the generalized least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) is generalized, in order to allow for changes in the spectral content. As shown here, the resulting LASSO formulation can be solved in a simple manner using cyclic minimization, enabling recursive estimation for non-stationary signals. The proposed generalized time-updating <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$q$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-SPICE offers the same benefits as the original estimator, including being computationally efficient at constant computational and storage cost, but also allows for substantial improvements when dealing with non-stationary signals. The performance of the method is evaluated using both stationary and non-stationary signals, indicating the preferable performance of the generalized formulation as compared to the original time-updating SPICE algorithm.",2019,IEEE Access

Int. Soc. Med. Hydr., 1949). Em Portugal, e durante muitos anos, foram utilizados: a)- Peloides naturais â€“ nas Termas dos Cucos, Torres Vedras (agua hipermineralizada, cloretada sodica, silicatada) e nos Acores, entre outras nas Termas das Furnas (aguas hipomineralizadas, sulfureas, silicatadas e aluminosas, algumas ferruginosas). b)- Peloides artificiais â€“ obtidos a partir de lamas recolhidas dos depositos do leito do Rio Vouga, perto de Aveiro, e devidamente limpas e preparadas para posterior maturacao em tanques alimentados com agua sulfurea a 37-39 oC, durante 6 meses, de modo a adquirir uma muito elevada quantidade de sulfurarea, pratica durante anos utilizada nas Termas de Vizela e nas Termas de Aregos. Umas e outras eram utilizadas depois na terapeutica de doencas reumaticas e outras doencas musculo-esqueleticas ou na terapeutica de dermatoses eczematosas (nomeadamente psoriase). No inicio da decada de 90 do seculo passado, tudo se modificou: Primeiro, pelo encerramento das Termas dos Cucos (que aguardam ainda restauro); depois, por forca da legislacao entretanto produzida e que aumentou o rigor de controlo microbiologico da utilizacao da agua mineral a nivel das estÃ¢ncias termais, ou por simultÃ¢nea estrategia economicista, as Termas de Vizela e de Aregos deixaram de cultivar a maturacao artifical dos peloides.

Uma tal pratica, porem e infelizmente, tem vindo a generalizar-se em muitas das estÃ¢ncias termais portuguesas, num aproveitamento abusivo do nome de â€œfangosâ€ que, em nosso entender, nao contribui em nada para a dignificacao do termalismo. A nivel da talassoterapia, Portugal tem algumas regioes com â€œlamas marinhasâ€, naturais e de alguma qualidade, algumas enriquecidas com diversos tipos de algas que naturalmente maturam nesses depositos, como as da Praia do Foz do Minho, Praia da Consolacao (Peniche), Praia do Meco (Caparica) e algumas da costa algarvia. Infelizmente, porem, tais â€œlamas marinhasâ€ tem sido apenas exploradas espontaneamente pelas populacoes, sem qualquer enquadramento terapeutico organizado.

sealasso: an R package for Standard Error Adjusted Adaptive Lasso (SEA-lasso),"inuence its variable selection performance. Qian and Yang (2010) proposed two versions of the adaptive lasso named SEA-lasso and NSEA-lasso that incorporate the OLS-standard errors to the l1 penalty term. It is shown that they outperform the usually used weight with OLS estimate only (we call the latter weight selection method OLS-adaptive lasso), especially when the condition index of the model matrix is large. In practice, it is advisable that NSEA-lasso is used when the condition index is greater than 10 (more specically, the condition index is dened as the natural logarithm of the ratio of the largest eigenvalue to the smallest eigenvalue for the matrix X T X, where X is the scaled predictor matrix). In fact, NSEA-lasso is the default method in sealasso package. It should be pointed out that this package applies only to linear regression setting, and the number of predictors must be greater than 1 and less than the sample size.

In questo modo sara possibile evidenziare gli strumenti comunicativi utilizzati dal regime per far presa sul pubblico, comprendere quale fosse il ruolo-chiave giocato dalle mostre nella propaganda fascista, ma anche percepire la visione discriminatoria â€“ nell'ottica di una politica nazionalista e, con il passare degli anni, sempre piu improntata a una visione razzista â€“ con cui si cercava di educare le masse nella visione dell'â€œaltroâ€. This paper aims to highlight the fundamental principles of the colonial policy promoted by the Fascist regime throughout the study of some Milanese exhibitions organised by the liberal government at first and by the representatives of the PNF a little bit later, during the â€œVentennioâ€.

Ãœber Komplikationen bei lumbalen Kontrastverfahren,"ZusammenfassungDie Komplikationen der einzelnen Kontrastmitteluntersuchungen des Spinalkanals (Abrodilmyelographie, Peridurographie, Luftmyelographie, JodÃ¶lmyelographie) werden einer zusammenhÃ¤ngenden Besprechung unterzogen und ihr Anwendungsbereich kritisch abgegrenzt.Die Abrodilmyelographie und die Peridurographie sind besonders beim Vorliegen eines Stopsyndroms nicht ungefÃ¤hrlich. Deshalb sind sie dabei im strengen Sinne kontraindiziert. Zur Diagnose eines lumbalen Bandscheibenprolapses ist eine Kontrastmitteluntersuchung, besonders wenn sie eine GefÃ¤hrdung des Patienten in sich birgt, in der Regel Ã¼berflÃ¼ssig.Zur HÃ¶henlokalisation raumfordernder spinaler Prozesse ist heute noch die JodÃ¶lmyelographie die Methode der Wahl. Sie allein ist mit unwesentlichen akuten Gefahren behaftet. Um jedoch etwaigen erheblichen SpÃ¤tschÃ¤den vorzubeugen, soll sie nur dann angewendet werden, wenn eine anschlieÃŸende Operation, bei der das Kontrastmittel wieder aus dem Spinalkanal entfernt wird, in unmittelbarer Aussicht steht.SummaryThe complications of the x-ray examinations with contrast medium of the spinal canal (abrodilmyelography, peridurography, myelography with air, myelography with iodized oil) are discussed and their different use is pointed out.The abrodilmyelography and the peridurography are not without danger, especially in cases of a block syndrom; they are therefore, strictly speaking, not advisable. For the diagnosis of a prolapse of the lumbar ligamentous disc, the examination with contrast medium is generally unnecessary, especially when this method represents a danger for the patient. Even to-day the myelography with iodized oil is the preferred method for the localization of expensive spinal processes; it is subject only to unessential acute dangers. However, for preventing eventual severe secondary injuries, it is only to be used when an immediate operation is foreseen, whereby the contrast medium is removed from the spinal canal.RÃ©sumÃ©Les complications de chaque examen par le moyen de contraste du canal rachidien vertÃ©bral (abrodilmyÃ©lographie, pÃ©ridurographie, myÃ©lographie avec air, myÃ©lographie avec huile iodÃ©e) sont discutÃ©es et on fait la dÃ©limitation critique de leur champ d'application. L'abrodilmyÃ©lographie et la pÃ©ridurographie sont dangeureuses, surtout dans le syndrome de bloc. Par consÃ©quent, au sens strict du mot, elles sont contreindiquÃ©es.

High-Dimensional $L_2$Boosting: Rate of Convergence,"Boosting is one of the most significant developments in machine learning. This paper studies the rate of convergence of $L_2$Boosting, which is tailored for regression, in a high-dimensional setting. Moreover, we introduce so-called \textquotedblleft post-Boosting\textquotedblright. This is a post-selection estimator which applies ordinary least squares to the variables selected in the first stage by $L_2$Boosting. Another variant is \textquotedblleft Orthogonal Boosting\textquotedblright\ where after each step an orthogonal projection is conducted. We show that both post-$L_2$Boosting and the orthogonal boosting achieve the same rate of convergence as LASSO in a sparse, high-dimensional setting. We show that the rate of convergence of the classical $L_2$Boosting depends on the design matrix described by a sparse eigenvalue constant. To show the latter results, we derive new approximation results for the pure greedy algorithm, based on analyzing the revisiting behavior of $L_2$Boosting. We also introduce feasible rules for early stopping, which can be easily implemented and used in applied work. Our results also allow a direct comparison between LASSO and boosting which has been missing from the literature. Finally, we present simulation studies and applications to illustrate the relevance of our theoretical results and to provide insights into the practical aspects of boosting. In these simulation studies, post-$L_2$Boosting clearly outperforms LASSO.",2016,arXiv: Machine Learning
Incidence and predictors of silent cerebral embolism during pulmonary vein catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation.,"AIMS
Left atrial catheter ablation of the pulmonary veins (PV) has evolved as an important therapeutic option for the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF). We aimed to investigate the incidence and predictors of silent cerebral embolism associated with PV catheter ablation, detected by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI).


METHODS AND RESULTS
We performed a prospective analysis of 53 consecutive patients with persistent or paroxysmal AF that underwent PV ablation and post-procedural cerebral MRI 1 day after lasso catheter-guided ostial PV ablation. Patients were analysed for possible demographical, medical, echocardiographical, and procedural predictors of embolic events. A mean of 3.5 +/- 0.5 PVs were ablated per patient. In six patients, DW-MRI depicted new clinically silent microembolism after PV ablation (11%). The number of ineffective medical antiarrhythmic agents prior to ablation procedure was significantly higher in the embolism group (3.3 +/- 0.5 vs. 2.2 +/- 1.4, P = 0.014). Coronary heart disease (CAD) was more frequent in patients with cerebral embolisms (33 vs. 2%, P = 0.031); left ventricular volume (130 +/- 12 vs. 103 +/- 26 mL, P = 0.002), and septal wall thickness (13.0 +/- 1.4 vs. 7.9 +/- 4.8 mm, P = 0.025) were significantly increased.


CONCLUSION
This study shows a high incidence of silent micro-embolic events after PV ablation.

The small number of species can, however, be organized in different assemblages typical of the salt category dissolved into the water. For the first time a wide faunal study has been conducted (from 2002 to 2006) on hypersaline lakes of the Crimea peninsula (Ukraine) allowing us to recognize a total of 40 categories of zooplankton from 10 lakes in representation of the whole lake habitat of the peninsula. The only lake with water evidently influenced by the sea hosted the highest number of categories (20). The lowest number of categories (5) has been found in the lake which showed the highest salinity concentration. Apart the lake conditioned from sea water, other two categories of lakes were recognized: thalassohaline and atalassohaline on the basis of the species composition.",2012,

Metaxology and New Realist Philosophy,"Sandra Lehmann continues on the previous discussion of the ontological grounding of truth by comparing Desmondâ€™s metaxology to the revival of metaphysics in the New Realism of Quentin Meillassoux. While noting the superficial similarities between these philosophical projects, Lehmann clarifies that metaxology provides a more robust alternative to the anti-metaphysical philosophies of finitude of the twentieth century. Particularly prominent in her argument is that Meillassouxâ€™s discussion of the ground of being does not allow him to escape the shadow of Heideggerâ€™s critique of metaphysics, which is something more ably accomplished by metaxology.",2018,
Low noise sensitivity analysis of Lq-minimization in oversampled systems,"The class of Lq-regularized least squares (LQLS) are considered for estimating a p-dimensional vector \b{eta} from its n noisy linear observations y = X\b{eta}+w. The performance of these schemes are studied under the high-dimensional asymptotic setting in which p grows linearly with n. In this asymptotic setting, phase transition diagrams (PT) are often used for comparing the performance of different estimators. Although phase transition analysis is shown to provide useful information for compressed sensing, the fact that it ignores the measurement noise not only limits its applicability in many application areas, but also may lead to misunderstandings. For instance, consider a linear regression problem in which n > p and the signal is not exactly sparse. If the measurement noise is ignored in such systems, regularization techniques, such as LQLS, seem to be irrelevant since even the ordinary least squares (OLS) returns the exact solution. However, it is well-known that if n is not much larger than p then the regularization techniques improve the performance of OLS. In response to this limitation of PT analysis, we consider the low-noise sensitivity analysis. We show that this analysis framework (i) reveals the advantage of LQLS over OLS, (ii) captures the difference between different LQLS estimators even when n > p, and (iii) provides a fair comparison among different estimators in high signal-to-noise ratios. As an application of this framework, we will show that under mild conditions LASSO outperforms other LQLS even when the signal is dense. Finally, by a simple transformation we connect our low-noise sensitivity framework to the classical asymptotic regime in which n/p goes to infinity and characterize how and when regularization techniques offer improvements over ordinary least squares, and which regularizer gives the most improvement when the sample size is large.",2017,ArXiv
"Habitat Degradation and Settlement Behavior : Effects on Fish Settlement , Survival , and Recruitment","As coral reefs change in their composition, the dynamics of organisms that depend on them will likely also be affected. Traditionally, marine ecologists have recognized that settlement of fishes (and invertebrates) is tremendously variable in space and time, and changes in coral communities might therefore be expected to operate through effects on settlement. However, recent work demonstrates that density-dependent survival also varies spatially, with high quality sites offering greater recruitment than low quality sites at comparable settler densities. Furthermore, variation in settlement may often be correlated with site quality. As a result, understanding the response of fish populations to changes in coral communities requires that we understand how site quality and settlement interact through larval behavior. Here, we explore the implications of declines in site quality (e.g., due to the loss of coral habitat) and larval behavior. Specifically, we explore effects of larval site selection (and its dependency on site quality) and larval redirection (the extent to which larvae that would have settled at degraded sites can go on to settle elsewhere). We use data from the sixbar wrasse (Thalassoma hardwicke) system in Mo'orea, French Polynesia. We show that under some patterns of larval behavior, settlement, recruitment and survival can actually increase as habitat loss increases. These counter-intuitive results have important implications for informing monitoring studies of reef fish. The results also suggest the need for understanding the relationship between settlement rates and site quality, and for quantifying the extent of larval redirection.",2005,
"Organization of the male gonad in a protogynous fish, Thalassoma bifasciatum (Teleostei: Labridae).","Although the testis in teleosts has been investigated for many years, little attention has been paid to the structure of the outer layers that enclose the testis and to their possible contributions to its organization. The present study in a protogynous male labrid, Thalassoma bifasciatum (bluehead wrasse), describes the arrangement and cytology of these tissues (for convenience, referred to collectively as the outer wall, OW) which include: the outer peritoneal layer and subjacent collagen fibers, myoid cells and diverse other cells and tissues, e.g., fibrocytes, presumptive mesenchyme, macrophages, granulocytes, nerves, and blood vessels. Beneath the OW are two compartments; one is the gamete-laden spermatocysts, the other the interstitium, which is composed of cells and tissues that lie between the spermatocysts. Both OW and interstitium contain similar kinds of tissues and cells. Moreover, the layers of the OW immediately subjacent to the peritoneum are continuous with that in the interstitium. It is suggested that the continuity between these two areas provides opportunities for the exchange of cells that could aid in the maintenance and reorganization of the testis and with the myoid and neural tissue to establish an extensive, coordinated motile system that aids movement of sperm from spermatocysts to the ducts. A recent report on the reexamination of the germinal epithelium concept and its identification in the common snook, Centropomus undecimalis, stimulated us to examine the feasibility of applying this concept to gonad organization and gamete development in T. bifasciatum. In addition, the ultrastructure of the Sertoli cell and formation of spermatocysts are described. Spermatocysts increase in size during the development of gametes. Observations and discussion are presented suggesting how Sertoli cells may accommodate this growth and how new populations of these cells may arise in the mature adult. Finally, ultrastructural characteristics for each stage of spermatogenesis are presented and, using (3H)thymidine and autoradiography, data on the chronology of spermatogonia-sperm cycle are included.",2002,Journal of morphology
The old-age security motive for fertility.,The conditions under which the old-age security motive could be expected to be significant for fertility are described. Such conditions are likely to prevail in rural areas of developing countries and especially among women. Empirical studies on the subject are evaluated and the inconclusive and contradictory nature of the findings are attributed to failures to select appropriate samples and variables. Most findings derive from studies only marginally concerned with the old-age security motive for fertility. The paper concludes with suggestions for future research. Some of the earlier studies found surprisingly little or no relation between the old-age pension participation variables and various measures of fertility especially in developing countries. More recent studies have generally found significant negative relationships. Entwisle and Winegarden obtained evidence of a reinforcing feedback from low fertility to the expansion of the depth and breadth of coverage of participation in old-age security programs. A study done by DeVany and Sanchez concluded that the land-retention and other benefits of children to their parents are greater for those living on land which cannot be bought or sold than for those on privately owned land. Nugent and Gillaspy found that fertility changes between 1960 and 1970 across counties were negatively related to the size of the social security proxy variable. Cains 1981 study showed that the insecurity characterizing rural areas of developing countries is not limited to old age and disability but also includes calamitous events whose presence contribute to high fertility. The 1980 study of Vlassoff and Vlassoff concluded that old-age security was unimportant as a motive for fertility. There is a need for additional more systematic and more special-purpose empirical studies to investigate the impact of old-age security on fertility. Studies should be conducted in rural areas of developing countries where the old-age pension motive is expected to be strong. The sample size should be large enough to afford the opportunity to isolate the old-age pension affects from the effects of other variables and data collection should be repeated at various times.

"Cranial anatomy of a newpliosaurid Acostasaurus pavachoquensis from the LowerCretaceous of Colombia, South America","Following the marine extinctions at the end of the Jurassic, only three clades of Plesiosauria passed into the Lower Cretaceous: Brachaucheninae (thalassophonean pliosaurids), Cryptoclididae, and Xenopsaria. However, these plesiosaur clades, and the Brachaucheninae in particular, are represented by a limited number of genera. The Berriasian to Albian thereby represents a considerable period of time (~45 Ma) lacking a plesiosaur-rich strata or LagerstÃ¤tte: a time period we here designate as the â€œLower Cretaceous Gapâ€ or LCG. One critical region for understanding LCG plesiosaurs is modern northern South America, which, during Early Cretaceous times acted as a crossover between the northern and southern hemispheres, and between the Pacific and protoAtlantic oceans, as Gondwana gradually divided. Colombia preserves one of the most complete Lower Cretaceous sedimentary successions in the world. These strata, deposited in an epicontinental sea on the margin of Gondwana, are well-exposed close to Villa de Leyva, central Colombia. From the lower Barremian Arcillolitas Abigarradas Member of the Paja Formation, we describe a new genus and species of pliosaurid, Acostasaurus pavachoquensis. Acid preparation has exposed an exceptionally well-preserved three-dimensional pliosaurid skull with superb anatomical detail, allowing thorough description of previously poorly known areas of the plesiosaur skull such as the olfactory wings, otic capsules, sclerotic plates, basicranium and mandibular symphysis. Acostasaurus displays a unique suite of characters: short preorbital rostrum, stepped maxilla contacting the nasal and parietal posteriorly, large nasal in contact with the parietal, frontal with small exposure dorsally, deep notch in the dorsal surface of orbital margin, sagittal crest formed from the parietal and squamosal, dentition markedly heterodont, four pairs of premaxillary teeth, and a mandibular symphysial region containing five-and-a-half tooth pairs, which together differentiate Acostasaurus from all the other Cretaceous pliosaurid genera. Based on analysis of morphological characters used in recent phylogenetic studies, Acostasaurus nests firmly within the increasingly inclusive Pliosauroidea and Pliosauridae, almost certainly within Thalassophonea, and with much less certainty within Brachaucheninae, assuming Acostasaurus does not represent part of a new clade passing into the Early Cretaceous. As a brevirostrine taxon, Acostasaurus is distinctly different from the generally longer-snouted Brachauchenine genera Brachauchenius, Kronosaurus, Megacephalosaurus, Makhaira and Stenorhynchosaurus. The presence of Acostasaurus, together with other as yet undescribed plesiosaurs in central Colombia, firmly establishes northern South America as a key region for understanding of the taxonomy and phylogeny of Lower Cretaceous Gap pliosaurids.",2017,Palaeontographica Abteilung A-palaozoologie-stratigraphie

"Predictive sparse modeling of fMRI data for improved classification, regression, and visualization using the k-support norm","We explore various sparse regularization techniques for analyzing fMRI data, such as the â„“1 norm (often called LASSO in the context of a squared loss function), elastic net, and the recently introduced k-support norm. Employing sparsity regularization allows us to handle the curse of dimensionality, a problem commonly found in fMRI analysis. In this work we consider sparse regularization in both the regression and classification settings. We perform experiments on fMRI scans from cocaine-addicted as well as healthy control subjects. We show that in many cases, use of the k-support norm leads to better predictive performance, solution stability, and interpretability as compared to other standard approaches. We additionally analyze the advantages of using the absolute loss function versus the standard squared loss which leads to significantly better predictive performance for the regularization methods tested in almost all cases. Our results support the use of the k-support norm for fMRI analysis and on the clinical side, the generalizability of the I-RISA model of cocaine addiction.",2015,Computerized medical imaging and graphics : the official journal of the Computerized Medical Imaging Society

Multitask Classification Hypothesis Space With Improved Generalization Bounds,"This paper presents a pair of hypothesis spaces (HSs) of vector-valued functions intended to be used in the context of multitask classification. While both are parameterized on the elements of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and impose a feature mapping that is common to all tasks, one of them assumes this mapping as fixed, while the more general one learns the mapping via multiple kernel learning. For these new HSs, empirical Rademacher complexity-based generalization bounds are derived, and are shown to be tighter than the bound of a particular HS, which has appeared recently in the literature, leading to improved performance. As a matter of fact, the latter HS is shown to be a special case of ours. Based on an equivalence to Group-Lasso type HSs, the proposed HSs are utilized toward corresponding support vector machine-based formulations. Finally, experimental results on multitask learning problems underline the quality of the derived bounds and validate this paper's analysis.",2015,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems
Analysis of phenotypic- and Estimated Breeding Values (EBV) to dissect the genetic architecture of complex traits in a Scots pine three-generation pedigree design.,"In forest tree breeding, family-based Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) studies are valuable as methods to dissect the complexity of a trait and as a source of candidate genes. In the field of conifer research, our study contributes to the evaluation of phenotypic and predicted breeding values for the identification of QTL linked to complex traits in a three-generation pedigree population in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.). A total of 11 470 open pollinated F2-progeny trees established at three different locations, were measured for growth and adaptive traits. Breeding values were predicted for their 360 mothers, originating from a single cross of two grand-parents. A multilevel LASSO association analysis was conducted to detect QTL using genotypes of the mothers with the corresponding phenotypes and Estimated Breeding Values (EBV). Different levels of genotype-by-environment (Gâ€¯Ã—â€¯E) effects among sites at different years, were detected for survival and height. Moderate-to-low narrow sense heritabilities and EBV accuracies were found for all traits and all sites. We identified 18 AFLPs and 12 SNPs to be associated with QTL for one or more traits. 62 QTL were significant with percentages of variance explained ranging from 1.7 to 18.9%. In those cases where the same marker was associated to a phenotypic or an ebvQTL, the ebvQTL always explained higher proportion of the variance, maybe due to the more accurate nature of Estimated Breeding Values (EBV). Two SNP-QTL showed pleiotropic effects for traits related with hardiness, seed, cone and flower production. Furthermore, we detected several QTL with significant effects across multiple ages, which could be considered as strong candidate loci for early selection. The lack of reproducibility of some QTL detected across sites may be due to environmental heterogeneity reflected by the genotype- and QTL-by-environment effects.",2019,Journal of theoretical biology
Network Theory in Finance: Applications to Financial Contagion Analysis and Portfolio Optimization,"Network theory is a powerful tool for the analysis of complex systems, and in recent years a growing body of literature highlights the usefulness of this approach in finance. 
This thesis explores two particular fields of application of network theory in finance. The first is the modelization of systemic risk and financial contagion in a banking network, and is discussed in three chapters: first we estimate sparse partial correlation networks build from credit default swaps (CDS) spreads using tlasso, a methodology based on the multivariate t-Student distribution, suitable for data with fat tails and outliers. Then we propose an analysis based on network-DCoVaR, a tail-risk network constructed using quantile graphical models. We study in depth the characteristics of the resulting networks, focusing in particular on the structural properties of the system. Finally, we study a liquidity contagion model in presence of a network with communities. 
The second field of application is portfolio optimization. In particular, the tlasso model is applied to the estimation of parameters in Markowitz style portfolios. The covariance matrix of a set of assets, and in particular its inverse, the so-called precision matrix, is closely related to graphical models. Here, the previously cited tlasso model is used for the estimation of the precision matrix. Moreover, the interpretation of the precision matrix as a network opens the possibility to implement investment strategies based on network indicators. 
The main contributions of the thesis are the following: first, we introduced the use of tlasso in the financial literature, extending the results obtained. Then we introduce the network version of âˆ†CoVaR, and we propose an estimation procedure based on the SCAD penalization framework. Concerning the study of systemic risk, this work is among the first to focus on the presence of a community structure in a banking system, that is particular in the Europe setting where national borders are still relevant divisions.",2019,
Profit-based churn prediction based on Minimax Probability Machines,"Abstract In this paper, we propose three novel profit-driven strategies for churn prediction. Our proposals extend the ideas of the Minimax Probability Machine, a robust optimization approach for binary classification that maximizes sensitivity and specificity using a probabilistic setting. We adapt this method and other variants to maximize the profit of a retention campaign in the objective function, unlike most profit-based strategies that use profit metrics to choose between classifiers, and/or to define the optimal classification threshold given a probabilistic output. A first approach is developed as a learning machine that does not include a regularization term, and subsequently extended by including the LASSO and Tikhonov regularizers. Experiments on well-known churn prediction datasets show that our proposal leads to the largest profit in comparison with other binary classification techniques.",2020,Eur. J. Oper. Res.

Fish community associated with Halophila stipulacea meadow in the Mediterranean Sea,"A B S T R A C T . - The ï¬sh fauna of a Halopila stipulacea meadow was studied in the Peninsula of Maddalena (Eastern Sici-l y , Italy; Mediterranean). Visual censuses were conducted every three months from October 1998 to July 1999 and fromOctober 2003 to July 2004. Environmental variables for water temperature, salinity and seagrass shoot density were col-lected on each sampling occasion. A total of 30 fish species from eight families were recorded. Three labrids and sparids,two serranids and one mullid were detected with high frequency of occurrence (> 75%), while Sarpa salpa, Coris j u l i s ,Oblada melanura, Mullus surmuletus and Thalassoma pavo were the most abundant species. Diversity index and densityvalues displayed a distinct seasonal pattern with highest values occurring in summer and autumn. These community vari-ables were positively related to water temperature, but not to salinity and shoot density. Differences were also found in therelationships between the relative abundances of two species ( Oblada melanura and Serranus cabrilla ) and water tempera -ture. Multivariate analysis revealed variation in species composition of the fish community throughout the year. The datashow that the ï¬ sh fauna of the Halophila stipulacea meadow of the Peninsula of Maddalena was characterised by a season -al variation of the community structure, probably mainly influenced by the fluctuations of environmental variables.

Malaria morbidity and mortality in infants and children in a West-African hospital,"Malaria is responsible for 30 % of admissions to the pediatric ward of Bobo-Dioulasso Hospital (Burkina Faso). The figure fluctuates between 11 % during the dry season and 43 % during the wet season, the time of peak transmission (> 100 potentially contaminating bites/person/year) in neighboring rural areas. The mortality rate among children with malaria is 7 %, and the disease accounts for 15 % of all childhood deaths in the hospital. Primary Health Care seems to have little impact on malaria, which remains one of the worst diseases in West Africa.",1992,

Configurations of Wardrop's equilibrium and application to traffic analysis,"This thesis consists of two parts, and the connection between them is the so-called Wardropâ€™s equilibrium. In the first part of this thesis, which is the theoretical part, we study the congested transport dynamics arising from a non-autonomous traffic optimization problem. In this setting, we prove one can find an optimal traffic strategy with support on the trajectories of a DiPerna-Lions flow. The proof follows the scheme introduced by Brasco, Carlier, and Santambrogio in the autonomous setting, applied to the case of supercritical Sobolev dependence in the spatial variable. This requires both Lipschitz and weighted Sobolev apriori bounds for the minimizers of a class of integral functionals whose ellipticity bounds are satisfied only away from a ball of the gradient variable. We are then able to find the configuration of Wardropâ€™s equilibrium. In the second part of this thesis, which is the practical part, we use the established Wardropâ€™s equilibrium in the theoretical section, in order to optimize the traffic problem in the real-life application. New OD demand problem formulation is explored which allows the modeller to define structural similarity between the historical and estimated OD matrix while ensuring computationally fast and tractable solution. Shrinkage regression methods, such as Ridge and Lasso regression, are proposed to define distance function between historical and estimated OD matrix, in order to minimize estimation variance, and ensure the estimated OD matrix is close to true value. The presented OD estimation models reduce the dimensionality of the OD demand vector, which is crucial when the dimensionality of OD matrix is high, due to a high level of the zoning system. A new solution approach based on the well-known gradient descent algorithm is applied to solve the proposed models. Finally, results are tested out on a real life-size network.",2018,

The immunology of EpsteinBarr virus infection,"EpsteinBarr virus is a classic example of a persistent human virus that has caught the imagination of immunologists, virologists and oncologists because of the juxtaposition of a number of important properties. First, the ability of the virus to immortalize B lymphocytes in vitro has provided an antigen presenting cell in which all the latent antigens of the virus are displayed and are available for systematic study. Second, the virus presents an ideal system for studying the immune parameters that maintain latency and the consequences of disturbing this cellvirus relationship. Third, this wealth of immunological background has provided a platform for elucidating the role of the immune system in protection from viralassociated malignancies of B cell and epithelial cell origin. Finally, attention is now being directed towards the development of vaccine formulations which might have broad application in the control of human malignancies.",2001,Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B
Assessing Vulnerability of Fish in the U.S. Marine Aquarium Trade,"The trade in coral reef fishes for aquariums encompasses over 1,800 species from over 40 exporting countries, yet the population status for most traded species is unknown and unevaluated. At the same time, these coral reef fishes face a growing number of threats and often occur in jurisdictions with limited management capacity and data. In response, we assess vulnerability to overfishing for 72 coral reef fishes popular in the aquarium trade for the United States â€“ the top importer â€“ from the top exporting countries (Indonesia and the Philippines). We use a data-limited assessment approach: productivity susceptibility analysis (PSA). PSA estimates relative vulnerability of species by assessing their biological productivity and susceptibility to overfishing. The most and least vulnerable stocks were differentiated by attributes related to the reproductive biology (e.g., breeding strategy, recruitment pattern, and fecundity), appropriateness, ease of capture (e.g., schooling and aggregation), and rates of natural mortality. Our analysis identifies several of the most and least vulnerable species popular in the aquarium fish trade. The species that ranked as least vulnerable to overcollection were Gobiodon okinawae, Nemateleotris magnifica, Gobiodon acicularis, Salarias fasciatus, Ptereleotris zebra, Gobiodon citrinus, Pseudocheilinus hexataenia, Chaetodon lunula, Nemateleotris decora, and Halichoeres chrysus. In contrast, the ten most vulnerable species were Chromileptes altivelis, Plectorhinchus chaetodonoides, Pterapogon kauderni, Premnas biaculeatus, Echidna nebulosa, Centropyge bicolor, Zebrasoma veliferum, Pomacanthus semicirculatus, Zebrasoma scopas, and Thalassoma lunare. In a data-limited context, we suggest how these vulnerability rankings can help guide future efforts for reducing vulnerability risk. In particular, species that are relatively high-vulnerability and high-volume are prime targets for research and aquaculture efforts, increased monitoring of collection and exports, species-specific stock assessments, and voluntary reductions by retailers and consumers to avoid overexploitation.",2019,Frontiers in Marine Science
Variable Selection in Bayesian Maximum Entropy 1 Quantile Regression 2,"4 Quantile regression has gained increasing popularity as it provides richer information than 5 the regular mean regression, and variable selection plays an important role in quantile regression 6 model building process, as it can improve the prediction accuracy by choosing an appropriate 7 subset of regression predictors. Unlike the traditional quantile regression, we consider the quan8 tile as an unknown parameter and estimate it jointly with other regression coefficients. In 9 particular, we consider the maximum entropy quantile regression and apply the Bayesian adap10 tive Lasso to it. A flat prior is put on the quantile parameter due to the lack of information 11 on it. Our proposed method not only addresses the problem about which quantile would be 12 the most probable one among all the candidates, but also reflects the inner relationship of the 13 data through the estimated quantile. We develop an efficient Gibbs sampler algorithm and show 14 that the performance of our proposed method is better than the Bayesian adaptive Lasso and 15 Bayesian Lasso through simulation studies and real data analysis. 16",2016,
Data-Driven Identification of Parametric Partial Differential Equations,"In this work we present a data-driven method for the discovery of parametric partial differential equations (PDEs), thus allowing one to disambiguate between the underlying evolution equations and their parametric dependencies. Group sparsity is used to ensure parsimonious representations of observed dynamics in the form of a parametric PDE, while also allowing the coefficients to have arbitrary time series, or spatial dependence. This work builds on previous methods for the identification of constant coefficient PDEs, expanding the field to include a new class of equations which until now have eluded machine learning based identification methods. We show that group sequentially thresholded ridge regression outperforms group LASSO in identifying the fewest terms in the PDE along with their parametric dependency. The method is demonstrated on four canonical models with and without the introduction of noise.",2019,SIAM J. Applied Dynamical Systems
Manifold Sparse Coding Based Hyperspectral Image Classification,"Hyperspectral image classification has received an increasing amount of interest in recent years. However, when representing pixels as vectors, the dimensionality of feature space is high, which causes â€œcurse of dimensionalityâ€ problem. In this paper, in order to alleviate the impact of above problem, a manifold sparse coding method is proposed. Firstly, matrix decomposition technique is used to find a concept set and calculates relative data projection in the concept set. Secondly, manifold learning regularization is imported into objective function to capture the intrinsic geometric structure in the data. Finally, LASSO regularization is used to obtain sparse representation of data projection. Experimental results on real hyperspectral image show that the proposed method has better performance than the other state-of-the-art methods.",2016,"International Journal of Signal Processing, Image Processing and Pattern Recognition"
The Pedagogy of Pimping: Educational Rigor or Mistreatment?,"Pimping has a bad name. In medical education, the term is saddled with negative and malicious connotations, regardless of the intended meaning. Derived from the German Pumpfrage, it has nothing to dowith findingcustomers for prostitutes but instead refers to the practice of a teacher asking a student a series of questions.Therelationofmedicalpimpingto thebroaderquestion of studentmistreatment suggests that this association of homonyms, while unfortunate, is not purely coincidental. In the current issue of JAMA, George and Green1 describe theresultsof theircreativeuseofgraphic imageryâ€”cartooningâ€” to prompt senior medical students at Penn State College of Medicine toportray their experiences inmedical school.Of the 66 students in their Comics in Medicine elective, 47% drew horror-genre cartoons,with scenes of darkness, demons, and death perpetrated by supervising physicians. Although not specifically referencingpimping, theydescribehowâ€œpossessing too little informationâ€ factored into at least 1 sceneof a studentâ€™sbeheading.Theauthorscorrectlyobservethat thesecomics convey the studentsâ€™ perspectives farmore viscerally than do their survey responses to the2015AssociationofAmerican Medical Collegesâ€™ GraduationQuestionnaire, inwhich almost 40% of 13 886 medical students reported at least 1 form of mistreatment.2 Theauthorsâ€™ approach is simultaneouslydiagnosticandtherapeutic.Althoughthestudentsâ€™cartoonsarenecessarilyhyperbolic, togetherwith thedata theyaredisturbing. Alsointhis issueofJAMA,McCarthyandMcEvoy3 lookmore directly at the question of pimping, both as amethodof teaching and in relation to studentmistreatment. These authors acknowledgemedical studentmistreatmentasasignificantproblemanddrawadistinctionbetweenâ€œbenignâ€andâ€œmalignantâ€ pimping. They point out that the few existing studies of pimping have focused on the lowest Kirkpatrick-level outcome, the learnerâ€™s reactions, rather than higher-level outcomes such as changesinlearning,behavior,orpatienthealth.However, incontrast tothedarkcomic imagesofeducationalexperiencesdrawn by the students of George and Green,1 these authors cite several articles inwhich students gave favorable responses to certain formsofpimping.Although theyquestion the reliabilityof surveysofavulnerable researchpopulation, theauthorscall for more research on pimping to preserve its educational potential in the face of increased awareness of, and need to address, studentmistreatment. Canpimpingeverbegood, or is it studentmistreatmentby definition? In their 1989and2009commentaries,bothentitled â€œTheArt of Pimping,â€ Brancati4 andDetsky5 both implied that pimping, if done artfully, has value. Whereas Brancatiâ€™s bemused and ironic informal advice on pimpingwell was provided for attending physicians, Detsky, writing in a more student-centric era, also included advice for students on protecting themselves against pimping. Detsky was more cautiousabout thepotential harmsofpimping, counselingattendings to apologize if they inadvertently inflict embarrassment. Wearetal6providedmoredetailedviewsof thebenefitsand potential harms of pimping in their qualitative study characterizing the interview responses of senior medical students. Theydescribedhowpimpingcanallow teachers to assess their learnersâ€™ knowledge base and then gauge their further teachingaccordingly.Thestudents in their studydescribed thevalue of pimping in learning to think quickly, handle the pressure of the spotlight, and develop stronger spines. One student even identified acculturation to the medical professionâ€” â€œbecoming part of the society and... able to talk to your colleaguesâ€â€”as a positive effect of pimping. Students identified â€œmalignantâ€ pimping by its intent to reinforce hierarchy, serve the ego of the teacher, and humiliate the student. One student reportedly saw value and motivation to learn in the humiliationofnotknowingananswer,notingcolloquially,â€œYou have to kick peopleâ€™s butt once in while.â€ Healy and Yoo7 reiterated this latter view. These authors acknowledged thedark sideofpimping that appearswhen the teacherâ€™s motivation is not educational, but they saw â€œhighstress, rapid-fire questioning that quickly imparts knowledge... inahighlymemorablewayâ€as â€œtruly a long-termkindness to the student, much like a vaccination that creates temporary discomfort to achieve a durable gain.â€ Kost and Chen8 rejected this sentiment and its terminology.Respondingtothenegativeculturalassociationsoftheword â€œpimping,â€ theyproposed that the termbe reserved strictly for behavior with negative connotations, specifically â€œquestioningofa learnerwith theexplicit intent tocausediscomfort such as shame or humiliation as a means of maintaining the power hierarchy inmedical education.â€Theyadvocated formoreconstructive formsof teachingbymakingquestionsmorepurposeful; more truly Socratic in aiming to activate critical thinking; and more grounded in adult learning theory, which considers the importanceofasafe, respectful, andsupportive learningenvironment.

Spectral wavelength selection and dimension reduction using Elastic Net in spectroscopy analysis,"In the use of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to build the multi-component gases quantitative analysis model, it is necessary to reduce the dimensions and select characteristics wavelength according to the target gas spectral. Through the regularization algorithm analysis, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator(LASSO) and Elastic Net method were used to do these for seven kinds of mixed gases of methane, ethane, propane, iso-butane, n-butane, iso-pentane and n-pentane. The minimum mean square error(MSE) and prediction deviation were used as the criteria to select LASSO and Elastic Net parameters. Finally, the resolution of 4cm-1measured spectral data was analyzed. The dimension of spectra were reduced from 2 542 d to 2d and 3d respectively by using LASSO and Elastic Net methodunder the condition of the MSE of 0.001 9 and 0.002 1. The cross sensitivity of maximum and minimum were 10.271 8% and 1.420 5% by LASSO method. The cross sensitivity of maximum and minimum were5.494 5% and 0.749 3% by Elastic Net. Results show that the Elastic Net method was better in the characteristic variable selection and the spectral dimension reduction for gas spectral quantitative analysis,and it was foundation to establish the accurate quantitative analysis model.",2014,Infrared and Laser Engineering

Learning Variables Structure Using Evolutionary Algorithms to Improve Predictive Performance,"Several previous works have shown how using prior knowledge within machine learning models helps to overcome the curse of dimensionality issue in high dimensional settings. However, most of these works are based on simple linear models (or variations) or do make the assumption of knowing a pre-defined variable grouping structure in advance, something that will not always be possible. This paper presents a hybrid genetic algorithm and machine learning approach which aims to learn variables grouping structure during the model estimation process, thus taking advantage of the benefits introduced by models based on problem-specific information but with no requirement of having a priory any information about variables structure. This approach has been tested on four synthetic datasets and its performance has been compared against two well-known reference models (LASSO and Group-LASSO). The results of the analysis showed how that the proposed approach, called GAGL, considerably outperformed LASSO and performed as well as Group-LASSO in high dimensional settings, with the added benefit of learning the variables grouping structure from data instead of requiring this information a priory before estimating the model.",2020,
"Faster, higher [exhibition]","Faster, Higher is a multi-screen installation commissioned by Film and Video Umbrella and the British Film Institute. Staged as a solo show at BFI Southbank to coincide with the Beijing Olympics and act as an imaginative precursor to London 2012, the work was also exhibited at the Hatton Gallery, Newcastle, in Hit The Ground (2009), as part of the Great North Run cultural programme. A further solo staging coinciding will take place at The Gallery, Winchester Discovery Centre (2012). 
 
 
 The work incorporates montages of Olympic archive material and rarely-seen Chinese documentary footage spanning the last century, with original footage shot near the London 2012 site. Despite Chinaâ€™s voluntary self-exclusion from the Games over three decades, and the avowed apolitical idealism of the latter as a global brand, Faster, Higher finds resonances and commonalities in the visual and cultural rhetoric around notions of nation, sport, patriotism and physical endeavour. New footage shot at the London Wushu Academy points to the mixed cultural identifications of young British athletes today, with martial arts serving as a (Chinese) national, internationally popular, and yet-to-be recognised Olympics sport. Opening with the rituals and symbols of state ceremony and international unity, flags jostle along a succession of parades, punctuated by the release of doves and balloons. Colour bars and countdowns signal a different â€˜universalâ€™, implicating the entwined histories of the Games and the moving image, while alluding to archival points of entry. The Olympic rings are echoed through clocks, archersâ€™ targets, lassoes, and gymnastsâ€™ hoops, while the ascent of pole-vaulters, mountaineers, balloons and lanterns invoke the movementâ€™s motto: citius, altius, fortius. Meanwhile, the 2012 site is rendered paradoxically visible and invisible via its blue perimeter: a literal and metaphorical screen, barrier and defence, against which dreams may be projected, protests erased, and the labour behind the spectacle concealed.",2008,

Australian Cattle Lingo,"TALK ABOUT TEXAS! Out in the Northern Territory of Australia there are some cattle ranches ten times the size of Rhode Island, where many a stockman was born, lived out his Biblical allowance (plus a healthy Australian bonus), and died, without ever leaving the property. Out where the continent's largest river may dry up for eighteen months, fence riders are still using camel trains. But this is in the Northern Territory, which is somewhat crowded-counting the naked aborigines, a population the size of Beverly Hills has an area twice the size of Texas to live in. Now 'way out west of sunset, right out back of beyond, out by Woop Woop, past the Black Stump, where the hand of man has never set foot, it's considerable lonelier. In fact, it's so far out, the people don't know beer. In this almost incredible loneliness of the Northern Territory and Western Queensland, and in the better populated pastureland of other states where conditions are unsuitable for sheep, there has grown up a cattle industry of some sixteen million head. This is only one-fourth the size of its American counterpart, but it has produced a way of life more vigorous and independent of foreign influence than any other in Australia. There is, of course, some American influence. The Aussie stockman, for example, likes to dress up in a gaudy movie outfit to go to town, even if there is no town to go to (the largest community along the Birdsville Track, the main stock route from South Australia to Eastern Queensland, has only seven houses on its one street). And even the blackfellow is more likely to have a guitar than trousers. Some motifs, too, are common to both areas, growing perhaps out of the basic nature of the work itself. The Aussie stockman gets just as weepy over his dying mates as the American cowhand, and both like to sing of their reluctance to be buried out on the lone prairie (outback) where the coyotes (dingoes) may gnaw their bones. Working methods are much the same, though the stockman prefers the long stockwhip to the lasso as a general working implement, and likes to leave most of the droving work to his preternaturally intelligent cattle dog. But the differences are significant, particularly to the linguist. The Aussie stockman does not speak quite the same language as the cowboy, nor does he sound the same. Like all Australians not educated in 'posh' schools, the Australian cattleman forms his vowels with a smaller mouth opening and with",1958,American Speech
Untersuchungen zum Einfluss des Mas-Rezeptors auf die Funktion von Î²-Zellen,"Das Renin-Angiotensin-System (RAS) ist ein Hormonsystem, das uber die Bindung von Angiotensin-Peptiden an ihre spezifischen Rezeptoren vielfaltige physiologische Prozesse beeinflussen kann. In den letzten Jahren gelangte die alternative Angiotensin-Converting-Enzym 2 (ACE2)/Angiotensin (Ang)-(1-7)/Mas-Rezeptor-Achse des RAS aufgrund ihrer protektiven Rolle bei pathophysiologischen Zustanden in den Fokus der Forschung. Wenig untersucht war bislang die Relevanz der lokalen ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas-Achse fur die Funktion von Langerhans-Inseln, besonders in Hinblick auf die Produktion und Sekretion von Insulin. Daher sollte im Rahmen der vorliegenden Arbeit der Einfluss des Mas-Rezeptors und seines Liganden Ang-(1-7) auf die Î²-Zell-Funktion bestimmt und verantwortliche molekulare Mechanismen aufgeklart werden. Dazu wurden isolierte Langerhans-Inseln von Wildtyp (WT) und Mas-defizienten Mausen genutzt, die zunachst umfassend hinsichtlich der Expression der Komponenten der ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas-Achse charakterisiert wurden. Dann wurde der Einfluss des Ang-(1-7) sowie der Ang-(1-7)-Antagonisten D-Ala7-Ang-(1-7) (A779) und D-Pro7-Ang-(1-7) (D-Pro) auf die Insulinproduktion und Glucose-stimulierte Insulinsekretion (GSIS) bestimmt. Isolierte Inseln von Mas-defizienten Mausen zeigten im Vergleich zu WT-Inseln eine signifikant reduzierte GSIS. Entsprechend bewirkte in WT-Inseln die Inkubation mit A779 und D-Pro eine Reduktion der GSIS, wohingegen der Mas-Ligand Ang-(1-7) diese signifikant steigern konnte. Diese Befunde unterstreichen die Bedeutung der ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas-Achse fur die Modulation der Insulinsekretion in Langerhans-Inseln. 
Unter Verwendung pharmakologischer Hemmstoffe wurden zugrunde liegende Signal-Transduktionswege untersucht. Die erhaltenen Ergebnisse sprechen fur die Beteiligung von cyklischem Adenosinmonophosphat (cAMP) an der Mas-abhangigen Regulation der Insulinsekretion. Ergebnisse weiterfuhrender Experimente machen wahrscheinlich, dass diese Ang-(1-7)-stimulierte Insulinsekretion hauptsachlich uber das exchange protein directly activated by cAMP 2 (EPAC2) verlauft. Auch nach Langzeit-Applikation von Ang-(1-7) in vivo zeigte sich ein stimulierender Effekt von Ang-(1-7) auf die GSIS von WT-Inseln. Es wurden auch Hinweise auf Mas-Rezeptor-unabhangige Ang-(1-7)-Wirkungen erhalten, die Gegenstand weiterfuhrender Untersuchungen sind. Der Einfluss von Ang-(1-7) und A779 auf die Glucosetoleranz in vivo war dagegen marginal. 
Um weitere Signalwege und Komponenten zu identifizieren, die an der Mas-abhangigen Regulation der GSIS beteiligt sind, wurde eine Massenspektrometrie-basierte Proteomanalyse von Langerhans-Inseln aus WT- und Mas-defizienten Mausen ohne und unter Einwirkung von Ang-(1-7) und A779 durchgefuhrt. Die Kandidaten mit signifikanten Mengenanderungen wurden anschliesend uber die IngenuityÂ® Pathway Analyse (IPA) in molekulare Netzwerke und funktionelle Kategorien eingeordnet. Die starkste Beeinflussung konnte bei den funktionellen Kategorien Zelltod und Zelluberleben, gastrointestinale Erkrankungen, Erkrankungen des endokrinen Systems, Stoffwechselerkrankungen und Zellzyklus festgestellt werden. 
Die Sekretions-Maschinerie wurde als ein wahrscheinlicher Angriffspunkt der Ang-(1-7)/Mas-vermittelten Signale in den Langerhans-Inseln identifiziert, da einige regulierte Proteine sekretionsassoziierte Signalwege, vesikelassoziierte Faktoren, Komponenten des Endoplasmatischen Retikulums und des Golgi-Apparates sowie Regulatoren des Zytoskeletts betreffen oder als potenziell ubergeordnete Regulatoren vorhergesagt werden konnten. Als eines der interessantesten Proteine wurde dabei das Golgi-reassembly stacking protein 2 (GORASP2) identifiziert, das fur die akkurate Golgi-Stapelung in der Zelle verantwortlich ist und auch in die unkonventionelle Proteinsekretion involviert ist. Eine Mas-Rezeptor-abhangige Beeinflussung von GORASP2 und damit der Insulinsekretion erscheint moglich und sollte in weiterfuhrenden Analysen verifiziert und hinsichtlich der molekularen Prozesse detailliert untersucht werden. 
Die vorgelegten Ergebnisse lassen den Schluss zu, dass die ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas-Achse des RAS sowohl in vitro als auch in vivo einen positiven Einfluss auf die Î²-Zell-Funktion ausubt. Inwieweit sich daraus neue Ansatzpunkte fur die Behandlung von Erkrankungen mit gestorter Î²-Zell-Funktion ergeben konnen, mussen Folgeuntersuchungen zeigen. Denkbar ware die Steigerung der GSIS bei Typ-2-Diabetes mellitus mittels stabilen Ang-(1-7)-Agonisten. Diese Moglichkeit zeigt die Wichtigkeit zur weiteren Erforschung der ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas-Achse in Langerhans-Inseln und ihrer genauen Wirkungen auf die Funktion von Î²-Zellen.",2019,
Combined registration and motion correction of longitudinal retinal OCT data,"Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has become an important modality for examination of the eye. To measure layer thicknesses in the retina, automated segmentation algorithms are often used, producing accurate and reliable measurements. However, subtle changes over time are difficult to detect since the magnitude of the change can be very small. Thus, tracking disease progression over short periods of time is difficult. Additionally, unstable eye position and motion alter the consistency of these measurements, even in healthy eyes. Thus, both registration and motion correction are important for processing longitudinal data of a specific patient. In this work, we propose a method to jointly do registration and motion correction. Given two scans of the same patient, we initially extract blood vessel points from a fundus projection image generated on the OCT data and estimate point correspondences. Due to saccadic eye movements during the scan, motion is often very abrupt, producing a sparse set of large displacements between successive B-scan images. Thus, we use lasso regression to estimate the movement of each image. By iterating between this regression and a rigid point-based registration, we are able to simultaneously align and correct the data. With longitudinal data from 39 healthy control subjects, our method improves the registration accuracy by 43% compared to simple alignment to the fovea and 8% when using point-based registration only. We also show improved consistency of repeated total retina thickness measurements.",2016,
Asymptotic Equivalence of Regularization Methods in Thresholded Parameter Space,"High-dimensional data analysis has motivated a spectrum of regularization methods for variable selection and sparse modeling, with two popular methods being convex and concave ones. A long debate has taken place on whether one class dominates the other, an important question both in theory and to practitioners. In this article, we characterize the asymptotic equivalence of regularization methods, with general penalty functions, in a thresholded parameter space under the generalized linear model setting, where the dimensionality can grow exponentially with the sample size. To assess their performance, we establish the oracle inequalitiesâ€”as in Bickel, Ritov, and Tsybakov (2009)â€”of the global minimizer for these methods under various prediction and variable selection losses. These results reveal an interesting phase transition phenomenon. For polynomially growing dimensionality, the L 1-regularization method of Lasso and concave methods are asymptotically equivalent, having the same convergence rates in the...",2013,Journal of the American Statistical Association
Radiomics Signature Predicts the Recurrence-Free Survival in Stage I Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.,"BACKGROUND
We aimed to explore the predictive value of radiomics signature for the recurrence-free survival (RFS) in patients with resected stage I non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).


METHODS
From January 2009 to December 2011, patients with resected stage I NSCLC were divided into sub-solid and pure-solid groups according to presence of ground glass opacity (GGO) in computed tomography (CT). A total of 107 extracted radiomics features were reduced to 8 features by using LASSO-Cox analysis to develop a radiomics signature for RFS prediction. Univariate and multivariate survival analyses were applied to identify independent prognostic variables, the Harrell concordance index (C-index) was measured to assess their prediction performance.


RESULTS
Our study included 378 patients with a median follow-up time of 63.2 months. The radiomics signature could stratify all patients into high-risk (180/378) and low-risk group (198/378) with different RFS (p<0.001). In the sub-solid group (n=115), 3 patients who occurred relapse were categorized into high-risk group by the radiomics signature. In pure-solid group, patients with low-risk (141/263) had a better outcome than those with high risk (122/263) (p<0.001). Multivariate analyses revealed that the histology (p<0.001), and the developed radiomics signature (p<0.001) remained independent prognostic factors for RFS.


CONCLUSION
Radiomics signature may be an independent imaging biomarker for predicting the survival, which may guide for personalizing treatment option in patients with stage I NSCLC.",2020,The Annals of thoracic surgery

The degrees of freedom of the Lasso for general design matrix,"In this paper, we investigate the degrees of freedom ($\dof$) of penalized $\ell_1$ minimization (also known as the Lasso) for linear regression models. We give a closed-form expression of the $\dof$ of the Lasso response. Namely, we show that for any given Lasso regularization parameter $\lambda$ and any observed data $y$ belonging to a set of full (Lebesgue) measure, the cardinality of the support of a particular solution of the Lasso problem is an unbiased estimator of the degrees of freedom. This is achieved without the need of uniqueness of the Lasso solution. Thus, our result holds true for both the underdetermined and the overdetermined case, where the latter was originally studied in \cite{zou}. We also show, by providing a simple counterexample, that although the $\dof$ theorem of \cite{zou} is correct, their proof contains a flaw since their divergence formula holds on a different set of a full measure than the one that they claim. An effective estimator of the number of degrees of freedom may have several applications including an objectively guided choice of the regularization parameter in the Lasso through the $\sure$ framework. Our theoretical findings are illustrated through several numerical simulations.",2011,arXiv: Statistics Theory
Cleaning Preferences of the Gobies Gobiosoma evelynae and G. prochilos and the Juvenile Wrasse Thalassoma bifasciatum,"Gobiosoma evelynae (Bohlke and Robins), G. prochilos (Bohlke and Robins), and juvenile Thalassoma bifasciatum (Bloch), long known to be ectoparasite-pickers, are differentiated in terms of their associations with the fishes they clean. The gobies are found to have very broad cleaning preferences, while the wrasse largely restricts its cleaning to non-piscivores. The protection from predation of the gobies is attributed to a more highly evolved specialization as a cleaner than that found in the wrasse. Tank experiments show piscivores to prey readily upon the wrasse, while the gobies exhibit cleaning behavior recognized by the piscivores, and thus escape predation.",1974,Copeia

"The astexin-1 lasso peptides: biosynthesis, stability, and structural studies.","Lasso peptides are a large family of natural products that owe their name to a unique structure formed by a side chain to backbone macrocyclization, resembling a knotted lasso. The unique structure has significant impact on their biological and physical properties, as lasso peptides are usually more stable than linear ones. Current work examines stability, structure, and biosynthesis of recently discovered lasso peptide astexin-1, a heat-sensitive lasso peptide. The obtained results revealed a new lasso structure with a tight loop and long tail as well as narrow specificity of the maturation machinery for some essential residues associated with the protease processing site, involved in macrolactam ring formation and entrapment of the tail. Using the astexin-1 structure, it was possible to rationally construct a thermostable variant of this lasso peptide.",2013,Chemistry & biology
Analysis of genotype by methylation interactions through sparsity-inducing regularized regression,"In this paper, we consider the use of the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)-type regression techniques to detect important genetic or epigenetic loci in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS). We demonstrate how these techniques can be adapted to provide quantifiable uncertainty using stability selection, including explicit control of the family-wise error rate. We also consider variants of the LASSO, such as the group LASSO, to study genetic and epigenetic interactions. We use these techniques to reproduce some existing results on the Genetics of Lipid Lowering Drugs and Diet Network (GOLDN) data set, which collects from 991 individuals blood triglyceride and differential methylation at 464,000 cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites and 761,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and to identify new research directions. Epigenome-wide and genome-wide models based on the LASSO are considered, as well as an interaction model limited to chromosome 11. The analyses replicate findings concerning 2 CpGs in carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A). Some suggestions are made regarding potentially interesting directions for the analysis of genetic and epigenetic interactions.",2018,BMC Proceedings

Multiple Change-Points Estimation in Linear Regression Models via Sparse Group Lasso,"We consider linear regression problems for which the underlying model undergoes multiple changes. Our goal is to estimate the number and locations of change-points that segment available data into different regions, and further produce sparse and interpretable models for each region. To address challenges of the existing approaches and to produce interpretable models, we propose a sparse group Lasso based approach for linear regression problems with change-points. Under certain mild assumptions and a properly chosen regularization term, we prove that the solution of the proposed approach is asymptotically consistent. In particular, we show that the estimation error of linear coefficients diminishes, and the locations of the estimated change-points are close to those of true change-points. We further propose a method to choose the regularization term so that the results mentioned above hold. In addition, we show that the complexity of the proposed algorithm is much smaller than those of existing approaches. Numerical examples are provided to validate the analytical results.",2015,IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing
"Environmental geochemistry and ecological risk assessment of potentially harmful elements in tropical semi-arid soils around the Bagassi South artisanal gold mining site, Burkina Faso","This study investigates geochemistry and ecological risk of artisanal gold mining-derived potentially harmful elements in semi-arid soils in Burkina Faso. R-mode factor analysis, which reduces the variables (elements) to few factors, was applied to explain the dominant variance in the data. Three factors, which account 80% of the total variance, described differences in soil geochemistry resulting from anthropogenic and geogenic sources. High loadings of factor 1 on As, Au, Bi, Cd, Hg, Mo, Pb, Sb, Te, W and Zn suggest that the artisanal gold mining was the most important factor controlling the soil geochemistry. Factor 2 had high loadings on Al, Fe, Mn, Ti, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Sc, Sr, Tl and V, representing their geogenic origin. With high loadings on Ca, Mg, S and La, factor 3 describes contribution of biogeochemical cycling to the elementsâ€™ abundance in the soils. Lead isotope compositions identified atmospheric deposition as themain source of Pb in farmland soils, whereas topsoil and soil profiles were primarily influenced by the mining activities. Mercury, As and, to a lesser degree, Cd posed the most serious ecological threat to the soils collected around the mining site relative to those of the farmland. Based on the findings of this study, a best pollution control plan of potentially harmful element loadings into soils is urgently required around artisanal gold mining sites across the country. ABOUT THE AUTHORS Aboubakar Sako is an environmental geochemist and assistant professor of environment and geosciences from University of DÃ©dougou (Burkina Faso). He holds a PhD in Environmental Sciences from Arkansas State University (Arkansas, USA). His research involves geochemical characterization of heavy metals in surface water, groundwater and soils. Dr Sako is also interested in hydrogeochemical modeling and ecological risk assessment of industrial and artisanal gold mining sites in the West Africa region. Mamadou Nimi is a geochemical analyst and presently head of the Geological Survey of Burkina Faso in the regional office of BoboDioulasso. He gained about 13 year experience in natural water, soil and rock sample characterization and analysis for environmental assessment and mineral exploration. PUBLIC INTEREST STATEMENT The study describes the anthropogenic and geogenic sources of artisanal gold mining-derived potentially toxic heavy metals/metalloids and their ecological impacts on semi-arid soils in southwestern Burkina Faso. Even though artisanal gold mining contributes to poverty alleviation in rural communities, it causes several environmental problems such deforestation, soil degradation and water and air pollution. The release and accumulation of large quantities of potentially harmful elements in the surrounding soils can pose serious threat to human health and also to ecosystems. The presence of hundreds of uncontrolled artisanal gold mining sites around rural dwellings and farmlands across the country makes environmental geochemistry and ecological risk assessment of potentially harmful elements in soils highly important.

Development and internal validation of a prognostic model for survival after debulking surgery for epithelial ovarian cancer.,"OBJECTIVE
Predicting survival of patients with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is based on prognosis of the population. Combining prognostic factors could facilitate survival prediction on the level of the individual patient. The aim of this study was to develop a prognostic model to predict five-year disease specific survival in patients with EOC, and to evaluate whether this would add to prediction based on prognosis of the population.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
A retrospective cohort study was performed of all EOC patients treated with primary debulking and adjuvant chemotherapy or neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and interval debulking surgery in three gynaecological-oncologic centres between 1998 and 2010. Primary outcome was 5-year disease-specific survival. We developed a Cox proportional hazard model using the LASSO-method to select the best combination of characteristics from 12 potential predictors and to correct for overfitting. Performance of the model was expressed as calibration and discrimination (c-statistic). A nomogram was developed to increase the clinical applicability of the model.


RESULTS
Of 840 patients with EOC 462 (55%) died within 5 years due to the disease. A combination of FIGO stage, residual tumour after surgery, primary or interval surgery, histology, performance status, age, amount of ascites and a family history suggestive of breast/ovarian cancer best predicted 5-year survival. The final model showed accurate calibration and the c-statistic was 0.71 (95% CI 0.69-0.74).


CONCLUSIONS
Five-year survival in all stage EOC patients can be predicted accurately using available characteristics. After external validation the model can be used for counselling of patients.",2014,Gynecologic oncology
RÃ©sultats des sutures tout en dedans par abord postÃ©romÃ©dial des lÃ©sions du mÃ©nisque mÃ©dial lors de la reconstruction du LCA au recul moyen de 24 mois,"Introduction Les series de la litterature de suture du menisque medial sur genou stable ou dans le cadre dâ€™une reconstruction du LCA montrent un taux dâ€™echec significatif. Le but de cette etude prospective est dâ€™evaluer les resultats des sutures tout en dedans par abord posteromedial des lesions du segment posterieur du menisque medial lors de la reconstruction du LCA. Nous faisons lâ€™hypothese que cette technique ameliore le taux de survie des sutures du menisque medial. Methode Entre octobre 2012Â et mars 2013, 132Â patients consecutifs dâ€™un Ã¢ge median de 26,4Â ans (12â€“57) ont beneficie dâ€™une suture du menisque medial au crochet (QuickPass suture lasso et N o Â 2Â FiberstickÂ ; Arthrex, Naples, Florida, Etats-Unis) par un a quatre points verticaux par abord posteromedial pour une lesion du segment posterieur conjointement a une reconstruction du LCA. Les lesions etendues au segment moyen et anses de seau ( n Â =Â 51) faisaient lâ€™objet dâ€™une procedure dite Â«Â mixteÂ Â» associant suture au crochet et ou suture hybride a implant meniscal et/ou suture a lâ€™aiguille de dehors en dedans. On denombrait 9Â % de lesions en anse de seau du menisque medial et 34Â % de lesion du menisque lateral. Le delai median avant chirurgie etait de 4Â mois (1Â semaineâ€“30Â ans). Lâ€™evaluation clinique au dernier recul comportait le score IKDC subjectif et la reprise des activites sportives (Echelle de Tegner). Le succes clinique etait defini par lâ€™absence de re-operation pour echec de la reparation meniscale. Ce dernier resultat a fait lâ€™objet dâ€™une analyse de survie Selon Kaplanâ€“Meier. Resultats Au recul moyen de 24Â mois (21â€“26Â mois), aucun patient nâ€™etait perdu de vue. Le taux de succes clinique etait de 93,2Â % (95Â % IC 0,887â€“0,974). On denombre 9Â re-operations pour recidive symptomatique dâ€™une lesion meniscale mediale. Dans 5Â cas, les lesions recurrentes survenaient dans une portion plus centrale du menisque en avant des fils decrivant un Â«Â timbre-posteÂ Â». Les lesions etendues au segment moyen semblent plus a risque de recidive (6Â versus 3) ( p Â =Â 0,069). Le score IKDC subjectif moyen etait de 87 (43â€“100). La reprise des activites sportives au meme niveau a ete possible pour 87,1Â % des patients. Lâ€™echelle de Tegner moyen passait de 7,2 (3â€“10) avant lâ€™accident a 6,9 (3â€“10) au recul ( p Â =Â 0,002). Aucune complication neurologique ou vasculaire nâ€™a ete rapportee. Conclusion Nos resultats montrent que la suture au crochet sous arthroscopie des lesions posterieures du menisque medial permet un taux de cicatrisation eleve au niveau de la lesion sans augmenter la morbidite liee a lâ€™abord supplementaire. En effet, cette technique permet une visualisation optimale, un debridement efficace des lesions du segment posterieur du menisque medial et la realisation de points verticaux. La recidive de certaines lesions peut sâ€™expliquer par la survenue de nouvelles lesions induites par les outils de suture et/ou lâ€™utilisation de fil non resorbable. Des etudes prospectives comparatives menees a plus long terme semblent necessaires pour confirmer cette impression.",2015,Revue de Chirurgie OrthopÃ©dique et Traumatologique
"A Comparison of Lasso , Elastic Net , Ridge Regression , and Bayesian Methods for Large-scale Regression","Large-scale regression problems, where the number of predictors is large compared with the number of observations, arise in many practical applications. Commonly-used methods for this problem can be divided into two types: Likelihood-penalization techniques, which use penalties on the regression coefficients to shrink them, and Bayesian approaches which achieve the same goal by using sparse or shrinkage priors. Despite the fact that these different types of approaches aim to tackle the same problem, and have been around for nearly two decades, their performances have seldom been directly compared with one another. In this thesis, we compare prediction performance among three popular penalization techniques, i.e, the ridge regression (Hoerl and Kennard, 1970), the lasso (Tibshirani, 1996), the elastic net (Zou and Hastie, 2005), and a Bayesian approach, Bayesian Sparse Linear Mixed Models (BSLMM) (Zhou et al, 2012). In a simulation study, BSLMM consistently outperformed the other three methods in prediction accuracy. In a microarray classification study, BSLMM performed as well as the elastic net, which outperformed the other methods.

Regularization Parameter Selection via Cross-Validation in the Presence of Dependent Regressors: A Simulation Study,"This letter reveals using simulation studies that regularization parameter selection via cross-validation (CV) in penalized regressions (e.g., Lasso) is valid even if the regressors are weakly dependent. In CV procedure, the time series structure of the data set is broken, meaning that there may occur a fatal problem unless the sample is i.i.d.; the estimation accuracy in the training step could be worse due to corruption of data continuity, which may furthermore lead to a bad choice of the regularization parameter. Even in such a situation, we find that CV works well as long as the sample size grows. These findings encourage us to apply the selection procedure via CV to macroeconomic empirical analyses with dependent regressors.",2015,Economics Bulletin
Rebel Capacity and Combat Tactics,"Both classic and modern theories of rebel warfare emphasize the role of unexpected attacks against better equipped and larger government forces. We test empirical implications of a simple model of combat and information-gathering using highly detailed information about Afghan rebel attacks, military base infiltration, insurgent-led spy networks, and counterinsurgent operations. As rebels gather more resources, their attacks become temporally concentrated: a one standard deviation increase in opium revenue leads to a .3 standard deviation increase in temporal clustering of rebel attacks. In contrast, following abnormal battlefield losses (labor scarcity), the timing of insurgent attacks becomes less concentrated: a one standard deviation increase in labor scarcity increases randomization of attack timing by .12 standard deviations. We supplement our benchmark specification with a novel instrumental variables (IV) approach that uses high resolution data on agronomic inputs and dimensionality reduction to instrument for opium suitability. We use LASSO and sample randomization tests to assess and confirm the validity of our IV approach. The main effect is significantly enhanced in areas where rebels have the capacity to spy on and infiltrate military installations. We use proprietary military surveys to estimate exposure to informal taxation by government officials, which shows that relatively lower reservation wages lead to larger revenue effects. We find evidence that rebels exhaust their resources during the fighting season after taxation.",2019,
Abstract CT171: Phase I/II study to evaluate the safety and preliminary activity of nivolumab in combination with vorolanib in patients with refractory thoracic tumors,"Background: Nivolumab monotherapy results in limited responses (19-25%) in thoracic tumors, therefore the potential exists to design combination strategies to improve tumor response. Evidence exists to suggest that antiangiogenic agents have the potential to stimulate the immune system. Several pilot trials combined inhibitors of PD-1/PD-L1 and VEGFR in renal cell carcinoma, and the combinations outperformed either single agent. However, none of the combinations were well tolerated at full doses of the drugs. Therefore, it is desirable to explore immunotherapy and antiangiogenic agent combinations that have lower toxicity. Vorolanib is structurally similar to the antiangiogenic agent sunitinib but was designed to improve the safety profile without compromising efficacy. Preclinically, vorolanib had comparable anti-tumor activity to sunitinib, and toxicokinetic analyses suggested a very high safety window. Methods:NCT03583086 is a multi-institutional, phase I/II study of nivolumab and vorolanib in patients with thoracic tumors who failed at least one prior line of chemotherapy. The primary objective of phase I is to determine the maximum tolerated dose. Dose escalation uses a standard 3+3 design with three dose levels of vorolanib (200, 300, and 400 mg once-daily) and 240 mg nivolumab every two weeks. Phase II evaluates efficacy of the combination among five cohorts: immunotherapy naive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), NSCLC patients that have progressed (primary refractory and acquired resistance) on immunotherapy, thymic carcinoma, and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients with progression on prior platinum-based chemotherapy. Primary refractory is defined as radiographic progression of disease within 12 weeks after initiation of checkpoint therapy; acquired resistance includes achieving radiographic partial or complete response, or stable disease for at least 12 weeks followed by radiographic disease progression. Enrollment to phase II will use a Simon two-stage design for each cohort. Exploratory objectives will be performed to quantify changes in the innate and adaptive immune responses after treatment. Mass cytometry will be used to monitor serial changes in multiple immune markers on individual circulating cells in the blood. Changes in each marker will be correlated with response using the Lasso-based elastic net method. Single cell gene expression analysis from peripheral blood samples collected prior to and at the end of treatment will be performed and correlated with response to combination therapy in order to improve our understanding of the biology behind systemic changes to this treatment. Enrollment to phase I is ongoing; 7 patients have been enrolled, including 3 in dose cohort 1 and 4 in dose cohort 2. Thus far, a dose-limiting toxicity of elevated liver function tests possibly related to nivolumab and vorolanib was observed in one patient enrolled in dose cohort 2. Citation Format: Jennifer G.

"Comments on cole et al. (1992). iv. the calderas of roccamonfina Volcano, Roman Region, Italy","The stratocone of Roccamonfina Volcano shows at least four calderas: main caldera, Gli Stagli caldera, northern caldera, and Valle caldera. The origin of these structures is independent on the major ignimbritic eruptions (Brown Leucitic Tuff, BLT, and White Trachytic Tuff, WIT), except perhaps the northern caldera, which collapsed as a consequence of BLT eruption. Radiometric age determinations show that the stratocone summit (main caldera) collapsed during the time lapse between 446 and 390 Ka. As Gli Stagli caldera slighdy intersects the main caldera, it must be younger. The dated macrophyric leucitetephrite lavas of the stratocone which lie within the northern caldera, or constitute its walls, are younger than similar rocks which form the walls of the main and Gli Stagli calderas. This evidence suggests that the northern caldera collapse post-dated the other two structures. All calderas originated because of the emptying of the magma chamber resulting from a succession of moderate-sized volcanic events of the stratocone, rather than as the consequences of volcanotectonic collapses of the main cone due to huge Â«instantaneousÂ» eruptions. An origin of these calderas by sector collapses of the stratocone is also to be ruled out owing to the absence of rockslide avalanche deposits near and beyond the margins of the calderas. However, in the main caldera, the collapse followed previous structural control by the apennine basement. Incremental collapse of the main caldera involving eruption of the BLT and WIT ignimbrites is also improbable. Within Gli Stagli caldera, lacustrine episodes alternated with the macrophyric leucite-tephritic lavas of the stratocone. These were followed by a thick sequence of pyroclastic rocks and younger lacustrine sediments. Deepening and downfaulting truncated the flat-lying sequence to produce the Valle caldera. Within the collapsed sequence, the 227 Ka Yellow Trachytic Tuff, YTT, is not the youngest formation. This evidence implies that the Valle caldera postdates YTT.RiassuntoLo stratocono del valicano di Roccamonfina presenta almeno quattro caldere: caldera principale (centrale sommita1e), caldera di Gli Stagli, caldera settentrionale e caldera di Valle. Lâ€™origine di queste caldere Ã¨ indipendente dalle eruzioni delle ignimbriti (Tufo Leucitico Marrone, BLT, e Tufo Trachitico Bianco, WIT), ad eccezione forse della caldera settentrionale. Inedite datazioni attribuiscono alla caldera principale unâ€™etÃ  fra 446.000 e 390.000 anni. La caldera di Gli Stagli interseca quella principale ed Ã¨ quindi piÃ¹ recente. Lungo il settore settentrionale della cinta della caldera di Gli Stagli le colate laviche di leucite-tefriti macrofiriche si alternano con sedimenti lacustri, suggerendo che eruzioni laviche e sedimentazione lacustre si alternarono nel tempo. Le leucite-tefriti macrofiriche datate costituenti la cinta della caldera settentrionale sono piÃ¹ recenti di quelle delle altre cinte calderiche, suggerendo che la caldera settentrionale si formÃ² successivamente alle altre due caldere. La vicinanza tra le etÃ  della caldera settentrionale e quelle del BLT suggerisce la possibilitÃ  di uno stretto legame genetico tra la formazione della caldera e lâ€™eruzione del tufo.

Rewriting Queries Using View for RDF/RDFS-Based Relational Data Integration,"We study the problem of answering queries through a target RDF-based ontology, given a set of view-based mappings between one or more source relational schemas and this target ontology. Particularly, we consider a set of RDFS semantic constraints such as rdfs:subClassof, rdfs:subPropertyof, rdfs:domain, and rdfs:range, which are present in RDF model but neither XML nor relational models. We formally define the query semantics in such an integration scenario, and design a novel query rewriting algorithm to implement the semantics.",2005,
"Regional Climate Change: Downscaling, Prediction, and Impact Assessment","Although the issue of climate change is often dealt with in global perspective, the impact of climate change must be assessed at regional scales. While global climate models can provide projections of the average state of large-scale circulation of future climate, the downscaling of such projections to regional scale with improved spatial and temporal resolution for both the forcing fields and the climatic responses is the basis for assessing the societal impacts of climate change. Therefore, it is important to not only study climate change at the global scale but also study the regional manifestations of the climate system at spatial scales ranging from less than a hundred kilometers to thousands of kilometers with time scales from months to years to decades. This special issue publishes a collection of articles covering a wide range of topics of our understanding of â€œregional climateâ€ from downscaling the variability of extreme rainfall over the Yangtze River basin (T. Gao and L. Xie) and assessing the water resources in the Yellow River region (Z. Wu et al.) in China to forecasting the precipitation and water resources in the Lake Victoria region in East Africa (X. Sun et al., R. Argent et al., and K. A. Smith and F. H. M. Semazzi), from downscaling wind energy resources in the contiguous United States (B. Liu et al.) to characterizing the precipitation extremes in the Carpathian region in central and southern Europe (L. Gaal et al.), and from analyzing the energy balance in semiarid grasslands in China (Q. Jiang et al.) to detecting future climate change signals in central and eastern Europe from numerical model simulations (M. Belda et al.). This special issue also includes articles addressing the impacts of regional climate change on tropical cyclones over the Atlantic Ocean (K. Xie and B. Liu), on crop yields in North China (H. Liu et al.), and on litter production and nutrient dynamics in a plantation in China (X. Ge et al.), as well as rainfall and drought in Eastern Kenya (M. O. Kisaka et al.). Additionally, several articles with focus on regional climate downscaling methodologies are also included. S. Kim et al. studied the effects of geographic features in a mountainous area on the downscaling of global climate model data; T. R. Lee et al. demonstrated the feasibility of using PRISM (parameterelevation regression on independent slope model) to downscale maximum temperature to subkilometer scale; L. Gao et al. applied the LASSO algorithm to statistically downscale the ERA-interim precipitation forecast over complex terrain; and K.-H. Min and W.-Y. Sun explored the application of an atmosphere-cryosphere coupledmodel in regional climate applications. These articles reflect the recent advances and applications in â€œregional climate downscaling, prediction, and impact assessmentâ€ from a set of unique angles. We hope they are of interest to peers.",2015,Advances in Meteorology

A 3-mRNA-based prognostic signature of survival in oral squamous cell carcinoma,"Background
Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the most common type of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma with an unsatisfactory prognosis. The aim of this study was to identify potential prognostic mRNA biomarkers of OSCC based on analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).


Methods
Expression profiles and clinical data of OSCC patients were collected from TCGA database. Univariate Cox analysis and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator Cox (LASSO Cox) regression were used to primarily screen prognostic biomarkers. Then multivariate Cox analysis was performed to build a prognostic model based on the selected prognostic mRNAs. Nomograms were generated to predict the individual's overall survival at 3 and 5 years. The model performance was assessed by the time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and calibration plot in both training cohort and validation cohort (GSE41613 from NCBI GEO databases). In addition, machine learning was used to assess the importance of risk factors of OSCC. Finally, in order to explore the potential mechanisms of OSCC, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis was completed.


Results
Three mRNAs (CLEC3B, C6 and CLCN1) were finally identified as a prognostic biomarker pattern. The risk score was imputed as: (-0.38602 Ã— expression level of CLEC3B) + (-0.20632 Ã— expression level of CLCN1) + (0.31541 Ã— expression level of C6). In the TCGA training cohort, the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.705 and 0.711 for 3- and 5-year survival, respectively. In the validation cohort, AUC was 0.718 and 0.717 for 3- and 5-year survival. A satisfactory agreement between predictive values and observation values was demonstrated by the calibration curve in the probabilities of 3- and 5- year survival in both cohorts. Furthermore, machine learning identified the 3-mRNA signature as the most important risk factor to survival of OSCC. Neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction was most enriched mostly in KEGG pathway analysis.


Conclusion
A 3-mRNA signature (CLEC3B, C6 and CLCN1) successfully predicted the survival of OSCC patients in both training and test cohort. In addition, this signature was an independent and the most important risk factor of OSCC.",2019,PeerJ
The Loss of the Great Outdoors: Neither Correlationist Gem nor Kantian Catastrophe,"Abstract This article concerns Quentin Meillassouxâ€™s claim that Kantâ€™s revolution is responsible for philosophyâ€™s catastrophic loss of the â€˜great outdoorsâ€™, of our knowledge of things as they are in themselves. I argue that Meillassouxâ€™s critique of Kantâ€™s â€˜weakâ€™ correlationism and his defence of â€˜strongâ€™ correlationism are predicated on a fallacious argument (termed â€˜the Gemâ€™ by David Stove) and the traditional, but in my view mistaken, metaphysical interpretation of Kantâ€™s transcendental distinction. I draw on Henry Allisonâ€™s interpretation of Kantâ€™s idealism to argue that when Kantâ€™s transcendental distinction is understood epistemologically we can avoid the fallacious reasoning underpinning Meillassouxâ€™s argument, and at the very least attenuate his concerns about the â€˜Kantian catastropheâ€™.",2017,Perspectives
Social Politics in Context: The Institutional Politics Theory and Social Spending at the End of the New Deal,"In this article, we develop an institutional politics theory of public social provision and examine U.S. social sp'ending programs at the end of the New Deal. This theory integrates key insights of institutional and political theories of social policy. Drawing on institutional arguments, our theory holds that the willingness or ability of prospending actors to promote social spending initiatives depends on institutional conditions, especially the extent of voting rights and the nature of political party systems. Furthermore, drawing on political arguments, the theory posits the importance of pro-spending actors, including progressive factions of political parties and organized challengers. To appraise the institutional politics theory, we analyze state-level outcomes for Old-Age Assistance pensions and Works Progress Administration wages, employing multiple regression and qualitative comparative analysis (QCA). All analyses support the institutional politics theory. Scholars often consider the U.S. exceptional in public social provision and its causes. The two major theories of public social provision - political and institutional - see the U.S. as peculiar. Political theorists often characterize U.S. political parties as nonideological and unlikely to propel public social provision. The same is true for the American labor movement, which is smaller and more divided than its Western European counterparts. For these reasons, political arguments explaining gains in U.S. public social spending often focus on challengers employing innovative forms of claims making. Institutional or statecentered theories portray U.S. state and political institutions as hindrances to * A previous version of this paper was presented at the 1993 annual meeting of the Eastern Sociological Society, Boston.

Apport des nouvelles technologies dans l'ablation de fibrillation atriale paroxystique par cryothÃ©rapie,"La fibrillation atriale (FA) est une maladie frequente aux lourdes complications pouvant etre definitivement traitee par des techniques d'ablation. Recemment, deux nouvelles innovations (la sonde AchieveTM et le catheter Arctic Front AdvanceTM) sont apparues. Notre etude vise a evaluer leur apport en termes d'efficacite et de securite d'utilisation. Dans un second temps, nous avons voulu evaluer la possibilite de ne plus realiser d'application ""bonus"" lorsque nous utilisions le catheter Arctic front AdvanceTM. METHODES : Nous avons inclus l'ensemble des patients qui ont eu une premiere ablation de cryotherapie de FA par cryotherapie dans le service de janvier 2009 a decembre 2012 au CHU de Rouen. La population etait divisee en trois groupes en fonction du materiel utilise : Le groupe AF (catheter d'ablation Artic FrontTM associe a un catheter lasso decapolaire) ; le groupe AF + A (catheter d'ablation Arctic FrontTM associe a la sonde AchieveTM) et le groupe AFA + A (catheter d'ablation Arctic Front AdvenceTM associe a la sonde AchieveTM) dans lequel il n'etait plus realise d'application ""bonus"". Le delai de suivi etait de 4 a 6 mois au cours duquel, il etait realise une consultation, un ECG et un enregistrement Holter de 24 heures. Le critere de jugement principal, ""succes"", etait obtenu lorsqu'au bout de ce delai, le patient etait asymptomatique et sans recidive d'arythmie sur les traces ECG et Holter. RESULTATS : Cent trente trois patients ont ete inclus (AF = 59 ; AF + A = 47 ; AFA + A = 27). Au terme du suivi, il ete constate une augmentation du taux de succes de l'intervention avec l'utilisation des nouvelles technologies (AF = 34% ; AF + A = 52% ; AFA + A = 76% ; p = 0,03). Le temps de procedure (AF = 153 min ; AF + A = 131 min ; AFA + A = 92 min ; p < 0,01) et le temps d'irradiation (AF = 28,3 min ; AF + A = 19,1 min ; AFA + A = 17,8 min ; p < 0,01) ont ete significativement reduits. La comparaison du taux de complication n'a pas permis de mettre en evidence de difference significative entre les trois groupes (AF = 8% ; AF + A = 13% ; AFA + A = 7% ; p = 0,56). CONCLUSION : L'apport des nouvelles technologies dans l'ablation de FA paroxystique par cryotherapie permet une diminution du temps de procedure et de scopie, tout en augmentant le taux de succes de l'intervention a court terme sans augmenter le taux de complications.",2013,
Population Density and the Economics of Territorial Defense in a Coral Reef Fish,"We propose that in some species, local population density can strongly affect the economic defendability of a mating territory. This is so because the numbers of females and potentially interfering males determine allocations of time and energy to reproduction and defense. At low densities, allocations to defense should be small and territorial mating success should initially rise with local density, reflecting the supply of females. If defense takes priority over mating, higher population densities can create a situation in which the time or energy devoted to defense against other males detracts from allocations to reproduction. Thus a point is reached where territorial mating success declines with increasing density, as a function of the number of nonterritorial males. We investigated these hypotheses by recording changes in the daily mating success of territorial males of the bluehead wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum) following experimental manipulations of local population size and composition. On large reefs, where mating population densities are already high, territorial mating success varied inversely with changes in overall population density and with changes in nonterritorial male numbers only; changes in female numbers had little effect. Thus at higher densities the demands of defense appear to be more important in determining mating success than the supply of available mates. Territorial mating success varied directly with population density changes only on the smallest experimental reef, where there were few nonterritorial males. The reduction of mating success at higher densities was correlated with a decrease in both the time spent in courtship and the efficiency of courtship itself. The effect of population density should be partic- ularly important in species with short breeding periods and where the male contributes relatively little time or energy to each mating.",1980,Ecology
Sparsity-aware estimation of nonlinear Volterra kernels,"The Volterra series expansion has well-documented merits for modeling smooth nonlinear systems. Given that nature itself is parsimonious and models with minimal degrees of freedom are attractive from a system identification viewpoint, estimating sparse Volterra models is of paramount importance. Based on input-output data, existing estimators of Volterra kernels are sparsity agnostic because they rely on standard (possibly recursive) least-squares approaches. Instead, the present contribution develops batch and recursive algorithms for estimating sparse Volterra kernels using the least-absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) along with its recent weighted and online variants. Analysis and simulations demonstrate that weighted (recursive) Lasso has the potential to obviate the â€œcurse of dimensionality,â€ especially in the under-determined case where input-output data are less than the number of unknowns dictated by the order of the expansion and the memory of the kernels.",2009,2009 3rd IEEE International Workshop on Computational Advances in Multi-Sensor Adaptive Processing (CAMSAP)

Machine Learning Based Error Modeling for Surrogate Model in Oil Reservoir Problem,"This thesis focuses on the construction and optimization of a prediction model for the errors resulting from a model order reduction (MOR) procedure in oil reservoir simulation. MOR is a numerical technique that projects the physical based model, which is also called the high-fidelity model (HFM), into a lower dimension by using matrix decomposition, such that the computational speed can be greatly increased. The reduced order model (ROM) is also known as surrogate model. Obviously, error occurs during the projection process. We want to estimate this error and predict it through building an error model, and to fortify the surrogate model by adapting a parameter estimation. In this thesis, three statistical methods will be adapted to our problem, including least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and two machine learning (ML) methods: long short term memory (LSTM) and fully-connected recurrent neural network (RNN). The training data is the error of the ROM, which is defined as the difference between the ROM values and HFM values. Efforts have also been made to improve the performance of the error model, including the pre-processing of the data, and several model optimization techniques. The model order reduction method here is a non-intrusive subdomain POD-RBF algorithm, which treats subsurface oil-water flow data by adapting domain decomposition (DD), radial basis function (RBF) and proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). The high-fidelity model is generated by Matlab reservoir simulation toolbox (MRST). The error is defined as the difference between the HFM data and the ROM data. Through the comparison of several statistical models, this error can be best predicted by an optimized traditional recurrent neural network.",2019,

Tissue Factor in Arterial and Venous Thrombosis: From Pathophysiology to Clinical Implications.,"The history of tissue factor (TF) goes back to the early 1960s with the discovery of brain thromboplastin and the documented evidence of its role in blood coagulation.1 Since 1987 several studies have documented the presence of this protein within human normal and pathological tissues, focusing on atherothrombotic diseases and cancer.2,3 Since the beginning of the new millennium, this scenario has been intensely studied. TF is a 47-kDa glycoprotein that binds to activated factor VII (FVIIa), leading to activation of factor X (FX) and factor IX (FIX). TF-initiated coagulation is fundamental in inducing thrombosis in the arterial and venous compartments. Tissue distribution reveals that TF is expressed in perivascular tissue, resulting in rapid hemostasis upon vascular injury. In addition, TF is present within atherosclerotic plaques mostly associated with macrophages and smooth muscle cells. TF is not normally present within the circulating blood, but its expression can be induced inmonocytes and neutrophils by a variety of agonists. Also, platelets have been recently shown to express TF upon activation. In addition, circulating microparticles (MPs) can provide consistent amounts of TF.4,5 This issue of Seminars in Thrombosis & Hemostasis is focused on the role of TF in arterial and venous thrombosis, providing insights that span from pathophysiology to clinical implications. First, Gajsievwicz and Morrissey review the structureâ€“function relationship of the interaction between TF and FVIIa, providing insights into their mechanistic activities in several biological processes.6 These concepts are extended to novel noncoagulant signaling mechanisms for the TF/VIIa complex, as cell migration and apoptosis, as pointed out by Ã…berg et al.7 Apart from celland vesselwall associated TF, the pathophysiological role of noncellassociated, and specifically of soluble, TF is addressed by Bogdanov and Versteeg.8 Cimmino et al then review the role of TF in coagulation and atherothrombosis, underlying the different mechanisms by which TF modulates this complex network that comprises not only blood coagulation but also other processes, for example, intracellular signaling, proliferation, and angiogenesis.9 Of particular interest nowadays is the role of TF-bearing circulating microparticles; although some methodological aspects still need to be solved, their application as prognostic biomarkers in venous or arterial thrombosis is very promising, as highlighted by van Es et al.10Neutrophils, which also express TF, may be physiological regulators of intravascular thrombosis, besides being the first line of defense of the immune system, as reviewed by Maugeri and Manfredi.11 In addition, a role of platelet TF can be proposed in patients with cardiovascular disease as highlighted by Camera et al.12 In particular, the fate of TF starting from the megakaryocyte up to the mature platelet is described. The articles by Versteeg and Falanga et al focus on the role of TF on cancer progression and on its relevance as a biomarker to assess the thrombotic risk in patients with cancer.13,14 Finally, Chiu et al review the role of protein disulphide isomerase (PDI) in thrombosis and discuss the proteins, including TF, characterized as PDI substrate.15 Moving from TF, in the last part of the issue, three contributions focus on the use of new oral anticoagulants as well as new hemostatic agents. No gender-related differences in safety and efficacy of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are reported by Dentali et al in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) or acute venous thromboembolism (VTE), with only a trend toward an increase in risk of bleeding in males as compared with females in the extended treatment of VTE.16 Increased bleeding is a major issue in the treatment with oral anticoagulants. In particular, Franchini et al review the management of bleeding associated with the use of DOACs, providing physicians with an algorithm for managing DOAC-associated bleeding.17 Finally, Franchini et al summarize new technologies and the current development status of the novel products for hemostasis, focusing in particular on",2015,Seminars in thrombosis and hemostasis

Estimation of Large Dimensional Factor Models with an Unknown Number of Breaks,"In this paper we study the estimation of a large dimensional factor model when the factor loadings exhibit an unknown number of changes over time. We propose a novel three-step procedure to detect the breaks if any and then identify their locations. In the first step, we divide the whole time span into subintervals and fit a conventional factor model on each interval. In the second step, we apply the adaptive fused group Lasso to identify intervals containing a break. In the third step, we devise a grid search method to estimate the location of the break on each identified interval. We show that with probability approaching one our method can identify the correct number of changes and estimate the break locations. Simulation studies indicate superb finite sample performance of our method. We apply our method to investigate Stock and Watsonâ€™s (2009) U.S. monthly macroeconomic data set and identify five breaks in the factor loadings, spanning 1959-2006.",2018,Journal of Econometrics

Seventy-eight anatomically guided linear lesions around ipsilateral PVs were performed in all cases and PV isolation rate was 93.6% ( 73 / 78). Mean procedure time was (245Â±56) min. Mean fluoroscopy time was (46Â±15) min. After a follow-up of 6 to 12 months, the overall success rate was 84.6% (33 / 39). Thirty three patients improved clinically and remained AF free. Six required antiarrhythmic medications to maintain sinus rhythm and 3 of them with recurrent AF didn't recur after a repeat ablaion. Conclusions Catheter ablation for AF guided by 3 dimensional mapping system is a feasible and effective method for treating AF.",2009,South China Journal of Cardiovascular Diseases
On Model Selection Algorithms in Multi-dimensional Contingency Tables,"We present a review focussed on model selection in log-linear models and contingency tables. The concepts of sparsity and high-dimensionality have become more important nowadays, for example, in the context of high-throughput genetic data. In particular, we describe recently developed automatic search algorithms for finding optimal hierarchical log-linear models (HLLMs) in sparse multi-dimensional contingency tables in R and some LASSO-type penalized likelihood model selection approaches. The methods rely, in part, on a new result which identifies and thus permits the rapid elimination of non-existent maximum likelihood estimators in high-dimensional tables.",2014,

Elevated Neopterin Levels Predict Early Death in Older Hip-fracture Patients,"Our society faces a major challenge concerning management of the health and socio-economic burden caused by acute physical stress in the older population (+75years). In particular, hip-fracture surgery (HFS) represents a major health care preoccupation, affecting 1.6 million patients worldwide, resulting in a significant drop in life quality and autonomy. The trauma is associated with 20-30% one-year mortality in the elderly. In the present study, we aim to identify factors, which influence and/or predict the outcome of elderly hip- fracture patients (HFP) post-surgery. Our objective was to identify biomarkers with a prognostic capacity of one-year mortality. We employed an observational cohort of HFP (n=60) followed-up longitudinally during the first year post fracture. Clinical and biological data (n=136), collected at arrival to hospital, were then compared to healthy controls (n=42) and analyzed using a regularized logistic regression model with lasso penalty followed by 10-fold cross-validation of variables. We show that plasmatic neopterin levels, a molecule released by IFN-Î³-activated macrophages, is predictive of mortality in HFP (ROC-AUC=0.859). Moreover, neopterin measured at arrival to the hospital correlated negatively with the time of survival after HFS. Neopterin therefore represents a biomarker, which enables better follow-up of patients at risk of early death.",2017,EBioMedicine
