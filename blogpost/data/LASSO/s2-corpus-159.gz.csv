Does SLOPE outperform bridge regression?,"A recently proposed SLOPE estimator (arXiv:1407.3824) has been shown to adaptively achieve the minimax $\ell_2$ estimation rate under high-dimensional sparse linear regression models (arXiv:1503.08393). Such minimax optimality holds in the regime where the sparsity level $k$, sample size $n$, and dimension $p$ satisfy $k/p \rightarrow 0$, $k\log p/n \rightarrow 0$. In this paper, we characterize the estimation error of SLOPE under the complementary regime where both $k$ and $n$ scale linearly with $p$, and provide new insights into the performance of SLOPE estimators. We first derive a concentration inequality for the finite sample mean square error (MSE) of SLOPE. The quantity that MSE concentrates around takes a complicated and implicit form. With delicate analysis of the quantity, we prove that among all SLOPE estimators, LASSO is optimal for estimating $k$-sparse parameter vectors that do not have tied non-zero components in the low noise scenario. On the other hand, in the large noise scenario, the family of SLOPE estimators are sub-optimal compared with bridge regression such as the Ridge estimator.",2019,ArXiv

Auditory Verbal Learning and Memory in Cases of Callosal Agenesis,"The importance of the corpus callosum in memory is not well established. Memory appears to function primarily through the consolidating action of subcortical structures like the hippocampus and amygdala on the cerebral cortex (see reviews by Mishkin and Appenzeller, 1987; Squire, 1987). The corpus callosum may play significant secondary roles, however, by transferring stimuli to the opposite cortex, inhibiting ipsilateral input, and/or facilitating processing within each hemisphere (see Cook, 1986; Jeeves, 1990; Lassonde, 1986).",1994,
Efficient Shrinkage for Generalized Linear Mixed Models Under Linear Restrictions,"Abstract In this paper, we consider the pretest, shrinkage, and penalty estimation procedures for generalized linear mixed models when it is conjectured that some of the regression parameters are restricted to a linear subspace. We develop the statistical properties of the pretest and shrinkage estimation methods, which include asymptotic distributional biases and risks. We show that the pretest and shrinkage estimators have a significantly higher relative efficiency than the classical estimator. Furthermore, we consider the penalty estimator LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator), and numerically compare its relative performance with that of the other estimators. A series of Monte Carlo simulation experiments are conducted with different combinations of inactive predictors, and the performance of each estimator is evaluated in terms of the simulated mean squared error. The study shows that the shrinkage and pretest estimators are comparable to the LASSO estimator when the number of inactive predictors in the model is relatively large. The estimators under consideration are applied to a real data set to illustrate the usefulness of the procedures in practice.",2018,
Electrophysiological findings during ablation of persistent atrial fibrillation with electroanatomic mapping and double Lasso catheter technique.,"BACKGROUND
Pulmonary veins (PVs) can be completely isolated with continuous circular lesions (CCLs) around the ipsilateral PVs. However, electrophysiological findings have not been described in detail during ablation of persistent atrial fibrillation (AF).


METHODS AND RESULTS
Forty patients with symptomatic persistent AF underwent complete isolation of the right-sided and left-sided ipsilateral PVs guided by 3D mapping and double Lasso technique during AF. Irrigated ablation was initially performed in the right-sided CCLs and subsequently in the left-sided CCLs. After complete isolation of both lateral PVs, stable sinus rhythm was achieved after AF termination in 12 patients; AF persisted and required cardioversion in 18 patients. In the remaining 10 patients, AF changed to left macroreentrant atrial tachycardia in 6 and common-type atrial flutter in 4 patients. All atrial tachycardias were successfully terminated during the procedure. Atrial tachyarrhythmias recurred in 15 of 40 patients at a median of 4 days after the initial ablation. A repeat ablation was performed at a median of 35 days after the initial procedure in 14 patients. During the repeat study, recovered PV conduction was found in 13 patients and successfully abolished by focal ablation of the conduction gap of the previous CCLs. After a mean of 8+/-2 months of follow-up, 38 (95%) of the 40 patients were free of AF.


CONCLUSIONS
In patients with persistent AF, CCLs can result in either AF termination or conversion to macroreentrant atrial tachycardia in 55% of the patients. In addition, recovered PV conduction after the initial procedure is a dominant finding in recurrent atrial tachyarrhythmias and can be successfully abolished.",2005,Circulation
What is required for data assimilation that is applicable to big data in the solid Earth science? Importance of simulation-/data-driven data assimilation,"Data assimilation (DA), which integrates numerical simulation models and observation data based on the Bayesian statistics, has been spreading its application field including the solid Earth science. However, the current DA is a sort of a deductive modeling method strongly depending on given simulation models, so that it never extracts, from big data, information that is beyond a priori assumptions of the simulation models. The present tutorial paper discusses the limitation of the current DA, and indicates an orientation how to implement data-driven modeling methods on DA procedure. Sparse modeling such as lasso has a potential to realize this, although specific methods are still under investigation.",2014,17th International Conference on Information Fusion (FUSION)
PDSLASSO: Stata module for post-selection and post-regularization OLS or IV estimation and inference,"pdslasso and ivlasso are routines for estimating structural parameters in linear models with many controls and/or instruments. The routines use methods for estimating sparse high-dimensional models, specifically the lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, Tibshirani 1996) and the square-root-lasso (Belloni et al. 2011, 2014). These estimators are used to select controls (pdslasso) and/or instruments (ivlasso) from a large set of variables (possibly numbering more than the number of observations), in a setting where the researcher is interested in estimating the causal impact of one or more (possibly endogenous) causal variables of interest. Two approaches are implemented in pdslasso and ivlasso: (1) The ""post-double-selection"" (PDS) methodology of Belloni et al. (2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016). (2) The ""post-regularization"" (CHS) methodology of Chernozhukov, Hansen and Spindler (2015). For instrumental variable estimation, ivlasso implements weak-identification-robust hypothesis tests and confidence sets using the Chernozhukov et al. (2013) sup-score test. The implemention of these methods in pdslasso and ivlasso require the Stata program rlasso (available in the separate Stata module lassopack), which provides lasso and square root-lasso estimation with data-driven penalization.",2018,Statistical Software Components
"Petrography and Paleoenvironmental Conditions During Formation of the Lignite Deposit at Prosilio, Northern Greece","This study focuses on the petrography of the lignite deposit at Prosilio, which is in the northern part of the larger basin of Prosilio-Polyracho-Trigoniko. The western part of this basin, which is in the center of our study, belongs to the larger graben structure that contains many other well-known lignite basins in Greece (e.g., Florina-Ptolemaida-Kozani-Servia-Elassona). The sediments in the basin are mainly limnic of Neogene age, surrounded by strata of Mesozoic or older age. The results in this study originated from core samples taken extensively within the lignite beds and were augmented with surface samplings from a recent mine face at Prosilio. The study consists of a macroscopic description of the lignite beds, followed by a microscopic description based on 16 polished samples. The results were interpreted on the basis of the groundwater index (GWI), vegetation index (VI), gelification index (GI) and tissue preservation idex (TPI). The above indices provided a clue as to the conditions of peat formation in the swamp. Specifically, the ratio of VI/GWI helped determine the hydrogeology and the availability of nutrients in the swamp. The ratio of TPI/GI indicated the paleoenvironmental conditions in relation to the water table. The above ratios suggested that the initial (parent) vegetation was that of open water. The conditions then changed in an alternating manner towards telmatic and limnotelmatic, with a few minor and local exceptions, although the dominance of the latter appeared to have prevailed.",2004,Energy Sources
Predictors of complications and mortality following left colectomy with primary stapled anastomosis for cancer: results of a multicentric study with 1111 patients.,"AIM
Reports detailing the morbidity-mortality after left colectomy are sparse and do not allow definitive conclusions to be drawn. We aimed to identify risk factors for anastomotic leakage, perioperative mortality and complications following left colectomy for colonic malignancies.


METHOD
We undertook a STROBE-compliant analysis of left colectomies included in a national prospective online database. Forty-two variables were analysed as potential independent risk factors for anastomotic leakage, postoperative morbidity and mortality. Variables were selected using the 'least absolute shrinkage and selection operator' (LASSO) method.


RESULTS
We analysed 1111 patients. Eight per cent of patients had a leakage and in 80% of them reoperation or surgical drainage was needed. A quarter of patients (24.9%) experienced at least one minor complication. Perioperative mortality was 2%, leakage being responsible for 47.6% of deaths. Obesity (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.00-7.05, PÂ =Â 0.04) and total parenteral nutrition (TPN) (OR 3.7, 95% CI 1.58-8.51, PÂ =Â 0.002) were associated with increased risk of leakage, whereas female patients had a lower risk (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.18-0.67, PÂ =Â 0.002). Corticosteroids (PÂ =Â 0.03) and oral anticoagulants (PÂ =Â 0.01) doubled the risk of complications, which was lower with hyperlipidaemia (OR 0.3, PÂ =Â 0.02). Patients on TPN had more complications (OR 4.02, 95% CI 2.03-8.07, PÂ =Â 0.04) and higher mortality (OR 8.7, 95% CI 1.8-40.9, PÂ =Â 0.006). Liver disease and advanced age impaired survival, corticosteroids being the strongest predictor of mortality (OR 21.5, PÂ =Â 0.001).


CONCLUSION
Requirement for TPN was associated with more leaks, complications and mortality. Leakage was presumably responsible for almost half of deaths. Hyperlipidaemia and female gender were associated with lower rates of complications. These findings warrant a better understanding of metabolic status on perioperative outcome after left colectomy.",2018,Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland
An extensive experimental survey of regression methods,"Regression is a very relevant problem in machine learning, with many different available approaches. The current work presents a comparison of a large collection composed by 77 popular regression models which belong to 19 families: linear and generalized linear models, generalized additive models, least squares, projection methods, LASSO and ridge regression, Bayesian models, Gaussian processes, quantile regression, nearest neighbors, regression trees and rules, random forests, bagging and boosting, neural networks, deep learning and support vector regression. These methods are evaluated using all the regression datasets of the UCI machine learning repository (83 datasets), with some exceptions due to technical reasons. The experimental work identifies several outstanding regression models: the M5 rule-based model with corrections based on nearest neighbors (cubist), the gradient boosted machine (gbm), the boosting ensemble of regression trees (bstTree) and the M5 regression tree. Cubist achieves the best squared correlation ( R2) in 15.7% of datasets being very near to it, with difference below 0.2 for 89.1% of datasets, and the median of these differences over the dataset collection is very low (0.0192), compared e.g. to the classical linear regression (0.150). However, cubist is slow and fails in several large datasets, while other similar regression models as M5 never fail and its difference to the best R2 is below 0.2 for 92.8% of datasets. Other well-performing regression models are the committee of neural networks (avNNet), extremely randomized regression trees (extraTrees, which achieves the best R2 in 33.7% of datasets), random forest (rf) and Îµ-support vector regression (svr), but they are slower and fail in several datasets. The fastest regression model is least angle regression lars, which is 70 and 2,115 times faster than M5 and cubist, respectively. The model which requires least memory is non-negative least squares (nnls), about 2 GB, similarly to cubist, while M5 requires about 8 GB. For 97.6% of datasets there is a regression model among the 10 bests which is very near (difference below 0.1) to the best R2, which increases to 100% allowing differences of 0.2. Therefore, provided that our dataset and model collection are representative enough, the main conclusion of this study is that, for a new regression problem, some model in our top-10 should achieve R2 near to the best attainable for that problem.",2019,Neural networks : the official journal of the International Neural Network Society
L'influenza delle attivitÃ  ritmiche cicliche degli arti superiori sui parametri cinetici e cinematici della deambulazione nel paziente emiplegico: lo studio di un caso,"Obiettivi: Valutare l'influenza di attivita ritmiche cicliche degli arti superiori per un periodo di 6 settimane (12 sedute complessive a frequenza bisettimanale) sui parametri cinetici e cinematici della deambulazione in un paziente con esito di ictus, presso la sede di tirocinio: centro studi riabilitazione neuromotoria, neuropsicologia, neuropsicoterapia (CSRN) a Milano, utilizzando un modello sperimentale su caso singolo del tipo A-B-A1-A2 
(Zahn & Ottenbacher, 2001). 
L'attivita terapeutica e stata svolta mediante l'evocazione di attivita ritmiche cicliche degli arti superiori con l'ausilio di un cicloergometro passivo assistito da motore (Electra S4), per un periodo di 30 minuti addizionali alla seduta riabilitativa. 
I criteri di efficacia dell'intervento sono stati identificati con l'incremento dei pendolarismi degli arti superiori durante la deambulazione e/o la modifica dei parametri di lunghezza e velocita del passo, e/o oscillazioni del tronco sul piano frontale 
 
Metodologia: L'analisi si basa su dati raccolti all'interno dello studio di neuroriabilitazione tramite osservazione standardizzata effettuata con i seguenti test di valutazione: test dei 6 metri (Lam, Lau, Chan, & Sykes, 2010) e una procedura osservativa inerente il numero dei pendolarismi e l'incremento dell'oscillazione del tronco sul piano frontale tramite l'applicazione Ipad Coach's Eye. 
La metodologia qui utilizzata e uno studio di caso singolo, in cui la scelta dell'intervento si e basata su una revisione della letteratura inerente gli studi di efficacia rivolti all'implementazione del pendolarismo degli arti ed i parametri ad essa associati 
 
Risultati: Ad una rivalutazione tramite il test dei 6 metri effettuato dopo le 12 sedute complessive a frequenza bisettimanale, con l'ausilio dell'applicazione Coach's Eye, si evidenzia una riduzione nella flessione del gomito di 3Â° in fase di terminal stance, ed un aumento del pendolarismo sul piano sagittale. Si evidenzia un aumento di 4Â° di inclinazione del bacino misurata tra malleolo interno e ala iliaca, che permette di rilevare una diminuzione della caduta del tronco sul piano frontale ed una maggior propulsione sagittale. Rimangono invariati i gradi di abduzione gleno omerale ed il toe angle in fase di terminal stance. 
Si evidenzia una riduzione di 2 secondi nell'esecuzione del test dei 6 metri 
 
 
Conclusioni: Dai dati ottenuti si ipotizza che attivita ritmiche cicliche degli arti superiori portano una modificazione dei parametri cinetici, cinematici e posturali della deambulazione di un paziente colpito da un evento ictale. 
Si necessiterebbero ulteriori studi in merito per identificare se le modificazioni dei parametri cinetici e cinematici della deambulazione siano dovute effettivamente ad attivita ritmiche cicliche degli arti superiori o per un aumento della tempistica della seduta riabilitativa ed applicare dei follow up scanditi su un lasso di tempo piu lungo.",2019,

Infant feeding modes and determinants among HIV-1-infected African Women in the Kesho Bora Study.,"OBJECTIVE
To assess breastfeeding modes and determinants in a prevention of mother-to-child transmission study.


DESIGN
HIV-1-infected pregnant women from 5 sites in Burkina Faso, Kenya, and South Africa were enrolled in the study that comprised 2 prospective cohorts and 1 randomized controlled trial. Women were counseled to either breastfeed exclusively up to 6 months or formula feed from birth.


METHODS
Determinants of breastfeeding initiation and continuation by 3 months postpartum were investigated using multiple logistic regression analysis. Neonatal morbidity was defined as mother-reported fever, diarrhea, or vomiting during the first month of life.


RESULTS
Among 1028, 781 women (76%) initiated breastfeeding and 565 of 995 (56%) were still breastfeeding at 3 months postpartum (30% exclusively, 18% predominantly, and 8% partially). Study site (Durban, Mombasa, and Nairobi compared with Bobo-Dioulasso), CD4 cell count (<200 cells/mm), secondary schooling (compared with none), and emergency cesarean delivery (compared with vaginal delivery) were independently associated with a lower probability of ever breastfeeding. The odds of still breastfeeding by 3 months postpartum (among those breastfeeding by 1 month) were lower in Mombasa, Nairobi, and Somkhele (compared with Bobo-Dioulasso) and among infants with neonatal morbidity [0.60 (0.37-0.976)]. The odds of exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) by 3 months (if EBF by 1 month) were lower in Mombasa and Nairobi, in ill neonates [0.54 (0.31-0.93)] and boys [0.51 (0.34-0.77)].


CONCLUSIONS
EBF was of short duration, particularly for boys. The importance of neonatal morbidity for breastfeeding cessation requires further investigation. Infant feeding counseling might need adaptation to better support mothers of boys and ill neonates.",2013,Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes
Radiofrequency catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation in old patients,"Objective To analyze the efficacy of different radiofrequency catheter ablation techniques in treatment of atrial fibrillation in old patients.Methods Consecutive 53 patients(60-83 years,38 men) were divided into 3 groups according to different ablation techniques used.Group 1 had 20 patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who underwent the ablation technique of isolating pulmonary veins,group 2 had 26 patients with typical atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation who underwent ablation of typical atrial flutter,and group 3 had 7 patients with drug-resistant persistent atrial fibrillation who underwent ablation of atrioventricular(AV) conduction and implantation of permanent pacemaker.Results In group 1,15 patients underwent isolation of 3-4 pulmonary veins under the direction of LASSO mapping catheter,and 8 of them(53%) had no atrial fibrillation after ablation.Five patients in group 1 underwent complete isolation of left atrium surrounding the pulmonary veins using the double-Lasso technique,and 4 of them(80%) had no atrial fibrillation after ablation.All the 26 patients in group 2 had successful ablation of typical atrial flutter,and 15 of them(58%) had no atrial fibrillation during follow-up.Eight of the 26 patients(31%) had significant decrease in the frequency of atrial fibrillation.After successful ablation of AV conduction in group 3,4 and 3 patients received respectively implantafion of right ventricular and biventricular pacing of VVI mode,and all of them had significant improvement in the quality of life and/or the symptoms of heart failure.Conclusion Different radiofrequency catheter ablation techniques had good clinical effects on different types of atrial fibrillation in old patients.",2008,Chinese Journal of Multiple Organ Diseases in the Elderly
eu HOMOTOPY ALGORITHM FOR BOX-CONSTRAINED LASSO AND ITS CONVERGENCE,"Abstract: The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) has received extensive attentions when sparse solutions are required. The homotopy method has become a significant approach for Lasso models because it can produce an entire regularization path. Although convergence has been studied on some special design matrices, the convergence analysis of the general homotopy method remains a problem. In this work, we present a homotopy method for the generalized Lasso model with box constraints. We propose mild convergence assumptions and prove that the algorithm terminates at an optimal solution under convergence assumptions.",2017,
Incorporating Intra-Operative Medication Information for Prediction of Post-Operative Atrial Fibrillation,"This study aimed to construct and evaluate a novel prediction model for postoperative atrial fibrillation (PoAF) with the addition of intraoperative medications. The study patient population included 4731 patients who underwent CABG surgery, of which 1363 developed PoAF, and the prediction methods included three logistic regression models. Multivariate logistic regression was performed with traditional clinical variables only for the first model, intraoperative medications added in the second model, and a subset of all variables chosen by the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) in the third model. Age and prior AF diagnosis were consistently the strongest predictors for PoAF across all three models. The specific intra-operative medications moderately improved predictive accuracy as compared to the clinical feature-only model.",2019,2019 IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics (ICHI)

Investigation of the Group Lasso Algorithm for Sound Field Reproduction : Comparison with the Lasso and Elastic-net Algorithms,"The reproduction of a sound field measured using a microphone array is an active topic of research. To this end, loudspeaker and microphone arrays are used. Classical methods rely on spatial transforms (such as spherical Fourier transform for Ambisonics) or pressure matching using least-mean-square formulation. For both methods, all the reproduction sources (i.e. loudspeakers) will typically be activated. Although this can provide a reduced or minimized reproduction error evaluated at the microphone array, it is not necessarily the most useful solution for listening purposes. Indeed, the fact that all reproduction sources are concurrently active can potentially lead to a blurry spatial image (an example would be the common front-back confusion). To solve that potential limitation, the lasso and elastic-net algorithms were recently studied in order to favor the sparsity of the reproduction source signals. In these studies, it was shown that sparsity can indeed lead to a sharper source distribution at the cost of reduced physical accuracy of the reproduced sound field. In this paper, the group lasso is investigated to alleviate such potential limitations of the lasso, where the ""group"" refer to groups of reproduction sources. The aim of the group lasso is to provide sparsity at the group level and continuous smooth solution inside groups. In the recent literature, many simple or detailed algorithms have been proposed for the real-valued group lasso without a consensual position from the community. For sound field reproduction, a simple algorithmic implementation is proposed as an interpretation of the group lasso for complex quantities. Simulation results in free field show that several of the limitations of the lasso and elastic-net algorithms are solved. Potentials and current limitations of the group lasso are discussed. Based on the reported investigation, future research openings include: the possibility of overlapping groups and the algorithmic implementation.",2017,

Radiomics signature: A potential biomarker for the prediction of MGMT promoter methylation in glioblastoma,"BACKGROUND
In glioblastoma (GBM), promoter methylation of the DNA repair gene O-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is associated with beneficial chemotherapy.


PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS
To analyze radiomics features for utilizing the full potential of medical imaging as biomarkers of MGMT promoter methylation.


STUDY TYPE
Retrospective.


POPULATION/SUBJECTS
In all, 98 GBM patients with known MGMT (48 methylated and 50 unmethylated tumors).


FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE
3.0T magnetic resonance (MR) images, containing T1 -weighted image (T1 WI), T2 -weighted image (T2 WI), and enhanced T1 WI.


ASSESSMENT
A region of interest (ROI) of the tumor was delineated. A total of 1665 radiomics features were extracted and quantized, and were reduced using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regularization.


STATISTICAL TESTING
After the support vector machine construction, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were computed for different sequences. An independent validation cohort containing 20 GBM patients was utilized to further evaluate the radiomics model performance.


RESULTS
Radiomics features of T1 WI reached an accuracy of 67.54%. Enhanced T1 WI features reached an accuracy of 82.01%, while T2 WI reached an accuracy of 69.25%. The best classification system for predicting MGMT promoter methylation status originated from the combination of 36â€‰T1 WI, T2 WI, and enhanced T1 WI images features, with an accuracy of 86.59%. Further validation on the independent cohort of 20 patients produced similar results, with an accuracy of 80%.


DATA CONCLUSION
Our results provide further evidence that radiomics MR features could predict MGMT methylation status in preoperative GBM. Multiple imaging modalities together can yield putative noninvasive biomarkers for the identification of MGMT.

Sparse Group Selection on Fused Lasso Components for Identifying Group-Specific DNA Copy Number Variations,"Detecting DNA copy number variations (CNVs) from arrayCGH or genotyping-array data to correlate with cancer outcomes is crucial for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer. Previous methods either focus on detecting CNVs in each individual patient sample or common CNVs across all the patient samples. These methods ignore the discrepancies introduced by the heterogeneity in the patient samples, which implies that common CNVs might only be shared within some groups of samples instead of all samples. In this paper, we propose a latent feature model that couples sparse sample group selection with fused lasso on CNV components to identify group-specific CNVs. Assuming a given group structure on patient samples by clinical information, sparse group selection on fused lasso (SGS-FL) identifies the optimal latent CNV components, each of which is specific to the samples in one or several groups. The group selection for each CNV component is determined dynamically by an adaptive algorithm to achieve a desired sparsity. Simulation results show that SGS-FL can more accurately identify the latent CNV components when there is a reliable underlying group structure in the samples. In the experiments on arrayCGH breast cancer and bladder cancer datasets, SGS-FL detected CNV regions that are more relevant to cancer, and provided latent feature weights that can be used for better sample classification.",2012,2012 IEEE 12th International Conference on Data Mining
Understanding Emergency Medicine Providers' Perceptions of the ACA in a Renewed Era of Health Care Reform: National Survey and Qualitative Mixedâ€Methods Approach: 2EMF,"Study Objectives: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is strongly associated with adverse clinical outcomes including prolonged hospitalization, progression to CKD, and death. Diagnosis of AKI relies on detection of changes in serum creatinine (sCr) and urine output, both of which lag days behind renal injury and are unreliable at initial presentation. Here, we utilized data mining and machine learning methods to develop a predictive model for AKI with capacity for identifying ED patients at high risk for development of AKI within 7 days of their ED visit. Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional cohort of ED visits from 3 hospitals over 2 years was generated and used for model derivation and out-of-sample validation. Clinical data for all adult ED visits where initial sCr measurements were available at index visit and again within 7 days of EDdeparturewere extracted froma relational database that underlies our electronic health record (EHR) by an experienced data user. Primary outcome for prediction was Stage 2 AKI within 7 days of ED visit, defined according to sCr-based Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria (sCr increase to 2 times baseline). Secondary outcomes included KDIGO Stage 1 AKI (sCr increase of 0.3mg/dl above baseline or 1.5 times baseline) and Stage 3 AKI (sCr increase to 3 times baseline or to 4.0 mg/dl). Predictor variables extracted from the EHR included vital signs, laboratory results, chief complaints, demographics, past medical history, active problems, home medications and EDmedication administrations. Only EHR data available prior to prediction, made at time of first metabolic panel result, was included. Predictor variables were normalized as follows: ED vital signs and laboratory results were processed to minimum and maximum values, nephrotoxic and nephroprotective medications were grouped by pharmacologic class and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) feature selection processing applied to chief complaints and active problems identify variables with predictive value for AKI.Multiple machine learning models (logistic regression, decision tree, linear discriminant analysis, support vector machine, and random forest) were generated and tested in the prediction of our primary outcome. All were developed using a training dataset comprised of 90% of encounters and evaluated in the remaining encounters using 10-fold cross validation. Performance of each model was assessed using binary classification measures and receiver operator curve (ROC) analyses. Results: Our final cohort included 127,183 ED visits by 72,539 unique patients. Median age was 58 years (IQR: 43-71) and most common high-risk comorbidities were hypertension (51.8%) and heart failure (9.8%). Incidence of AKI in our cohort was as follows: Stage 1: 12.4%, Stage 2: 1.5%, Stage 3: 1.0%. Predictive model performance as measured by area under the ROC analysis ranged from 0.661 (95% CI: 0.637 0.685) using decision tree to 0.771 (95% CI: 0.759 0.783) using random forest. Conclusions: Machine learning methods applied to EHR data identified ED patients at high risk for AKI well before patients met diagnostic criteria. The model developed here, when paired with nephroprotective point-of-care clinical decision support, has potential to improve outcomes for this patient population.",2018,Annals of Emergency Medicine

Identification of a four-gene metabolic signature predicting overall survival for hepatocellular carcinoma.,"While hundreds of consistently altered metabolic genes had been identified in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the prognostic role of them remains to be further elucidated. Messenger RNA expression profiles and clinicopathological data were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas-Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma and GSE14520 data set from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Univariate Cox regression analysis and lasso Cox regression model established a novel four-gene metabolic signature (including acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase 1, glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 2, phosphatidylserine synthase 2, and uridine-cytidine kinase 2) for HCC prognosis prediction. Patients in the high-risk group shown significantly poorer survival than patients in the low-risk group. The signature was significantly correlated with other negative prognostic factors such as higher Î±-fetoprotein. The signature was found to be an independent prognostic factor for HCC survival. Nomogram including the signature shown some clinical net benefit for overall survival prediction. Furthermore, gene set enrichment analyses revealed several significantly enriched pathways, which might help explain the underlying mechanisms. Our study identified a novel robust four-gene metabolic signature for HCC prognosis prediction. The signature might reflect the dysregulated metabolic microenvironment and provided potential biomarkers for metabolic therapy and treatment response prediction in HCC.",2019,Journal of cellular physiology

Abstract 19631: Application of Machine Learning Methods for Prediction of Outcomes After Cardiac Transplantation: Insights From the UNOS Database,"Objectives: It has been hypothesized that applying advanced analytic methodologies to large patient datasets can revolutionize patient care but the relative performance and comparative effectiveness of various statistical approaches remains unclear. Methods: The United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database was queried to identify initial adult heart transplants performed in the United States from 1987-2014 (N=50,453). We assessed prediction of 1 year survival using all donor and recipient variables except those with >20% missingness using traditional logistic regression and a comprehensive number of machine learning methodologies (ridge regression, regression with LASSO, support vector machines, naive Bayesian, tree-augmented Bayesian, neural network, random forest, and stochastic gradient boosting). We tested the predictive accuracy of these methods across UNOS regions for the following time periods [Period 1 (1987-1996); Period 2 (1996-2005); Period 3 (2006-2014)].

"Thalassomonas eurytherma sp. nov., a marine proteobacterium.","Two Gram-staining-negative, aerobic, rod-shaped bacterial strains, designated Za6a-12(T) and Za6a-17, were isolated from seawater of the East China Sea. Cells of Za6a-12(T) and Za6a-17 were approximately 1.5-2.0 ÂµmÃ—0.5-0.7 Âµm and motile by a single polar flagellum. Strains grew optimally at pH 7.5-8.0, 28 Â°C, and in the presence of 2.5-3.0% (w/v) NaCl. Chemotaxonomic analysis showed that the predominant respiratory quinone of strains Za6a-12(T) and Za6a-17 was ubiquinone-8 (>97%), and the major fatty acids were C(14â€Š:â€Š0), C(16â€Š:â€Š1)Ï‰7c and/or iso-C(15â€Š:â€Š0) 2-OH, C(16â€Š:â€Š0) and C(17â€Š:â€Š1)Ï‰8c. Their DNA G+C contents were 42.7 mol% and 42.8 mol%, respectively. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that the isolates belonged to the genus Thalassomonas and showed the highest sequence similarity to Thalassomonas loyana CBMAI 722(T) (95.9%). Strains Za6a-12(T) and Za6a-17 could be differentiated from T. loyana CBMAI 722(T) according to their phenotypic and chemotaxonomic features, DNA G+C contents and fatty acid composition. On the basis of these features, we propose strains Za6a-12(T) and Za6a-17 to be representatives of a novel species of the genus Thalassomonas with the name Thalassomonas eurytherma sp. nov. suggested.

Beneath the Umbrellas of Benevolent Men: Validating the Middle-Class Woman in Little Women and Five Little Peppers and How They Grew,"Long considered a children's classic, Louisa May Alcott's Little Women has also garnered acclaim from critical feminist scholarship, while Margaret Sidney's popular juvenile book Five Little Peppers and How They Grewâ€” strangely evocative of Little Womenâ€” has slept in relative obscurity. This nagging sense of deja-vu is quite plausible, perhaps even predictable, for Alcott and Sidney shared the daily intimacies of the social world of Concord, Massachusetts, as well as adheredâ€” with varying degrees of intensityâ€” to the domestic philosophy of the middle class, experiences that seeped under the shiny surfaces of their novels and formed social documentaries on the historical realities of women and work. For Jo March and Polly Pepper, as for their realworld counterparts, childhood labor is no frivolous pastime because it has a direct impact on their futures. Despite the vast differences in their childhoods, the task of being female and learning female tasks require Jo and Polly to seek security from men, in whose hands society traditionally has deposited the power and authority to decide how the female helpmeet may best help meet masculine needs. Therefore Jo and Polly undergo a similar rite of passage to become respectable women: they both leave the narrow confines of the domestic sphereâ€” their feminine-centered homes sequestered from the harsh world in a protective, pastoralized settingâ€” and experience life in the city, traditionally a male-dominated domain. Indeed, only by coming in close contact with mature male wisdom, the touchstone of virtue, do Jo and Polly become validated as middle-class women with legitimate, secure futures. BENEATH THE UMBRELLAS OF BENEVOLENT MEN: VALIDATION OF THE MIDDLE-CLASS WOMAN IN LITTLE WOMEN AND FIVE LITTLE PEPPERS AND HOW THEY GREW In the epigraph to A Moveable Feast (1964) Ernest Hemingway remarks, ""If you are lucky enough to have lived in Paris as a young man, then wherever you go for the rest of your life, it stays with you, for Paris is a moveable feast."" The same may be said for the beloved books of childhood. Savory morsels of our favorite stories linger in our memories as mementos of the tales that tempted and fed our youthful literary appetites. For years, children's historian F. J. H. Darton carried with him a host of rousing impressions of Swiss Family Robinson that had invigorated him as a boy. He recalls ""that a very large snake swallowed the donkey and was killed when comatose from repletion; that the family had a house in a tree; that they tamed and rode ostriches, made lassoes, built a boat, tapped the india-rubber tree, . . . and found a salt mine"" (qtd. in Rodgers 128). Upon reading that same book as an adult, however, Darton discovered a text ""full of the most extravagantly laboured piety"" (qtd. in Rodgers 128) that his boyish mind had never fathomed. The story had been a movable feast, but time and maturity revealed that the youthful consumer had sampled only a portion of the meal. Daniel T. Rodgers acknowledges the universality of this phenomenon in his book The Work Ethic in Industrial America 1850-1920. According to him, ""all children's stories"" can be termed ""twice-told tales"" that have been ""revised, elaborated, and severely edited in the intermediary",2015,
A New Generalized Error Path Algorithm for Model Selection,"Model selection with cross validation (CV) is very popular in machine learning. However, CV with grid and other common search strategies cannot guarantee to find the model with minimum CV error, which is often the ultimate goal of model selection. Recently, various solution path algorithms have been proposed for several important learning algorithms including support vector classification, Lasso, and so on. However, they still do not guarantee to find the model with minimum CV error. In this paper, we first show that the solution paths produced by various algorithms have the property of piecewise linearity. Then, we prove that a large class of error (or loss) functions are piecewise constant, linear, or quadratic w.r.t. the regularization parameter, based on the solution path. Finally, we propose a new generalized error path algorithm (GEP), and prove that it will find the model with minimum CV error for the entire range of the regularization parameter. The experimental results on a variety of datasets not only confirm our theoretical findings, but also show that the best model with our GEP has better generalization error on the test data, compared to the grid search, manual search, and random search.",2015,
Dissociation immuno-virologique chez les patients infectÃ©s par le VIH-1 sous traitement antirÃ©troviral a l'HÃ´pital de jour de Bobo-Dioulasso de 2008 Ã  2012 (Burkina Faso),"Objective: describe the sociodemographic, clinical, therapeutic, biological profile and the observance of the treatment of the cases of Discordant Immunologic and Virologic Responses (DIVR) at the 12 month old patients HIV-1 of antiretroviral treatment (TARV). Methods: This was a historical cohort study with descriptive and analytical referred from January 2008 to December 2012; covering the DIVR monitored at the day hospital of Bobo Dioulasso. We collected the data during the medical consultations by means of the software ESOPE and from the medical record of the patients. Results: Of 2078 patients on TARV, 84 is 4 % presented one DIVR, among which 56 women (66.7 %) and 28 men (33.3 %). The median age was 45 years [IQR = 45- 55 years]. At the initiation of TARV, most patients were in clinical stage 3 or 4 of the WHO (57.1%). The median of body mass index (BMI) was 20.5kg / m2 [IQR = 18.5 and 23]. The median number of +CD4 T lymphocyte was 42 cells / mm3 [IQR = 12- 63]. During follow-up, the median gain in BMI was 3.2 kg / m2 [IQR = 1.2 to 4.3 kg / m2], the median gain was 76 cells / Âµl [IQR = 60 - 88]. The viral plasmatic load of the HIV-1 was undetectable at all with a rate of TCD4+< 100 cells /Âµl in 12 months. Factors associated with DIVR was the age between 35 and 45 years (p = 0.0009), the number of +CD4 T cells (+CD4Tâ‰¤50) at initiation of TARV (p = 0.00045 ) and the WHO clinical stage 3. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the problem of management of DIVR in Bobo-Dioulasso and reminder all the interest of the follow-up of the people living with the HIV-1 by the viral load and not only by the rate of CD4+ T especially in the decentralized structures of coverage of the HIV, where changes of therapeutic diet take place in twists.",2015,
Fast and Positive Definite Estimation of Large Covariance Matrix for High-Dimensional Data Analysis,"Large covariance matrix estimation is a fundamental problem in many high-dimensional statistical analysis applications arises in economics and finance, bioinformatics, social networks, and climate studies. To achieve reliable estimation in the high-dimensional setting, an effective technique is to exploit the intrinsic structure of the covariance matrix, e.g., by sparsity regularization. For sparsity regularization, the lasso penalty is popular and convenient due to its convexity but has a bias problem. A nonconvex penalty can alleviate the bias problem, but the involved nonconvex problem under positive-definiteness constraint is generally difficult to solve. In this work, we propose an efficient algorithm for positive-definiteness constrained covariance estimation by combining the iteratively reweighted method and the alternative direction method of multipliers (ADMM). The iterative reweighting scheme can achieve better sparsity regularization than the lasso method. Meanwhile, the proposed algorithm solves convex subproblems in each iteration and is easy to converge. The efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm has been demonstrated by both simulation study and a gene clustering example for tumor tissues. Code for reproducing the results is available at https://github.com/FWen/pdlc.git.",2019,IEEE Transactions on Big Data
A model-based approach forestimating themeanincubation period,"ABSTRACT The incubation period, representing the in-terval between thedate ofexposureand the date ofdiagnosis, can be firmly ascertained in transfusion-associated cases of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).

Sparse model identification and learning for ultra-high-dimensional additive partially linear models,"Abstract The additive partially linear model (APLM) combines the flexibility of nonparametric regression with the parsimony of regression models, and has been widely used as a popular tool in multivariate nonparametric regression to alleviate the â€œcurse of dimensionalityâ€. A natural question raised in practice is the choice of structure in the nonparametric part, i.e., whether the continuous covariates enter into the model in linear or nonparametric form. In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework for simultaneous sparse model identification and learning for ultra-high-dimensional APLMs where both the linear and nonparametric components are possibly larger than the sample size. We propose a fast and efficient two-stage procedure. In the first stage, we decompose the nonparametric functions into a linear part and a nonlinear part. The nonlinear functions are approximated by constant spline bases, and a triple penalization procedure is proposed to select nonzero components using adaptive group LASSO. In the second stage, we refit data with selected covariates using higher order polynomial splines, and apply spline-backfitted local-linear smoothing to obtain asymptotic normality for the estimators. The procedure is shown to be consistent for model structure identification. It can identify zero, linear, and nonlinear components correctly and efficiently. Inference can be made on both linear coefficients and nonparametric functions. We conduct simulation studies to evaluate the performance of the method and apply the proposed method to a dataset on the Shoot Apical Meristem (SAM) of maize genotypes for illustration.",2019,J.

Radiomics Based on Multimodal MRI for the Differential Diagnosis of Benign and Malignant Breast Lesions.,"BACKGROUND
MRI-based radiomics has been used to diagnose breast lesions; however, little research combining quantitative pharmacokinetic parameters of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) and diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) exists.


PURPOSE
To develop and validate a multimodal MRI-based radiomics model for the differential diagnosis of benign and malignant breast lesions and analyze the discriminative abilities of different MR sequences.


STUDY TYPE
Retrospective.


POPULATION
In all, 207 female patients with 207 histopathology-confirmed breast lesions (95 benign and 112 malignant) were included in the study. Then 159 patients were assigned to the training group, and 48 patients comprised the validation group.


FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE
T2 -weighted (T2 W), T1 -weighted (T1 W), diffusion-weighted MR imaging (b-values = 0, 500, 800, and 2000â€‰seconds/mm2 ) and quantitative DCE-MRI were performed on a 3.0T MR scanner.


ASSESSMENT
Radiomics features were extracted from T2 WI, T1 WI, DKI, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps, and DCE pharmacokinetic parameter maps in the training set. Models based on each sequence or combinations of sequences were built using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier and used to differentiate benign and malignant breast lesions in the validation set.


STATISTICAL TESTS
Optimal feature selection was performed by Spearman's rank correlation coefficients and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator algorithm (LASSO). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to assess the diagnostic performance of the radiomics models in the validation set.


RESULTS
The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of the optimal radiomics model, including T2 WI, DKI, and quantitative DCE-MRI parameter maps was 0.921, with an accuracy of 0.833. The AUCs of the models based on T1 WI, T2 WI, ADC map, DKI, and DCE pharmacokinetic parameter maps were 0.730, 0.791, 0.770, 0.788, and 0.836, respectively.


DATA CONCLUSION
The model based on radiomics features from T2 WI, DKI, and quantitative DCE pharmacokinetic parameter maps has a high discriminatory ability for benign and malignant breast lesions.

As an example, land irrigation by waste water of cattle breeding complexes is considered when creating a biochemical barrier to the flow of nitrates in the way of grasses sowing lower along the flow direction, width approximately equal to the irrigated area which is recommended for elimination of ground and river water pollution. For land development with a complex soil covering Â«dryÂ» drainageÂ» is recommended on the area equal to the bottom of a subdominant hole. The 30 years practical experience of land reclamation of the Palassovskoj irrigation-watering system showed that the entire irrigation of large areas appeared impossible when there was no natural drainage. We do not see the necessity in the entire irrigation of similar spotty salted lands with a complex mezzoand micro relief, almost unprovided with natural drainage due to the reason of its small efficiency and ecological danger. For substantiation of the measures of the preventing secondary land salinization it is feasible to use a conception of halo geochemical capacity or salts capacity, that is equilibrium salts supplies formed under long-term stationary or quasi-stationary external factors: weather, hydrological, soil, organizational-economic. There is simulated a long-term dynamics of the land salts capacity of the Kolochnij steppe of the Western Siberia formed by a flow of ground water from the Altai foothills. The conception salt capacity creates a methodological basis for reclamation of saline soils which should be turned out to the control of this salts capacity but not to occasional salts removal, for example, under major washing without tackling the causes. Creation, destruction, control of biogeochemical barriers reveals the essence of land reclamation and recultivation, replenishes their methods. For their usage there are required adequate mathematical models and ways of long-term forecasting of natural and anthropogenic processes.",2016,
Evolution of the eastern Atlantic species,"The genetic relationships within and among congeneric species of marine fish from the Atlantic and the Mediterranean are poorly known. Relationships among all five species of the wrasse genus Thalassoma present in the Atlantic and the Mediterranean were examined using sequence data from the mitochondrial control region. Sampling was focused on the midAtlantic T. sanctaehelenae (Valenciennes, 1839) and T. ascensionis (Quoy & Gaimard, 1834), the eastern Atlantic T. newtoni (OsÃ³rio, 1891) from Sao Tome, and the eastern Atlantic/Mediterranean T. pavo (Linnaeus, 1758). Two western Atlantic species T. bifasciatum (Bloch, 1791) from the Caribbean and T. noronhanum (Boulenger, 1890) from Brazil served as outgroups. Tissues from a total of 132 individuals were sequenced. T. newtoni from Sao Tome preferentially grouped with the central Atlantic T. sanctaehelenae and T. ascensionis. T. pavo exhibits two distinct coloration patterns, one in the Cape Verde Islands and one in the eastern Atlantic Islands and Mediterranean. However, no genetic discontinuities between the Cape Verde Islands and the remaining samples or between Atlantic and Mediterranean individuals were found. Within Mediterranean populations of T. pavo, our data suggested the presence of a genetic break between eastern and western regions.",2004,
Algorithm validation using multicolor phantoms,"We present a framework for hyperspectral image (HSI) analysis validation, specifically abundance fraction estimation based on HSI measurements of water soluble dye mixtures printed on microarray chips. In our work we focus on the performance of two algorithms, the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and the Spatial LASSO (SPLASSO). The LASSO is a well known statistical method for simultaneously performing model estimation and variable selection. In the context of estimating abundance fractions in a HSI scene, the ""sparse"" representations provided by the LASSO are appropriate as not every pixel will be expected to contain every endmember. The SPLASSO is a novel approach we introduce here for HSI analysis which takes the framework of the LASSO algorithm a step further and incorporates the rich spatial information which is available in HSI to further improve the estimates of abundance. In our work here we introduce the dye mixture platform as a new benchmark data set for hyperspectral biomedical image processing and show our algorithm's improvement over the standard LASSO.",2012,Biomedical Optics Express

A general concern regards the magnitude of the effects from omic data which is a central point when designing a trial. In this work we present a simulation strategy to investigate the impact on some measures of prognostic impact (namely the (integrated) prediction error and the C-index) of the magnitude of the effects from omic covariates. We hypothesise the presence of clinical covariates with large impact on prognosis and not correlated with the omic data. We adopt as a method of analysis the Cox regression with lasso regularisation.",2016,
A race-DC in Big Data,"The strategy of divide-and-combine (DC) has been widely used in the area of big data. Bias-correction is crucial in the DC procedure for validly aggregating the locally biased estimators, especial for the case when the number of batches of data is large. This paper establishes a race-DC through a residual-adjustment composition estimate (race). The race-DC applies to various types of biased estimators, which include but are not limited to Lasso estimator, Ridge estimator and principal component estimator in linear regression, and least squares estimator in nonlinear regression. The resulting global estimator is strictly unbiased under linear model, and is acceleratingly bias-reduced in nonlinear model, and can achieve the theoretical optimality, for the case when the number of batches of data is large. Moreover, the race-DC is computationally simple because it is a least squares estimator in a pro forma linear regression. Detailed simulation studies demonstrate that the resulting global estimator is significantly bias-corrected, and the behavior is comparable with the oracle estimation and is much better than the competitors.",2019,arXiv: Methodology
Distribution verticale du carbone dans les sols - Analyse bayÃ©sienne des profils des teneurs en carbone et de C14,"Le rechauffement climatique est un probleme majeur pour le monde scientifique et les societes. La concentration de dioxyde de carbone a augmente de 45% depuis la periode preindustrielle (Harris, 2010), consequence des activites humaines desequilibrant le cycle du carbone mondial. Cela se traduit par un rechauffement de la planete avec des impacts dramatiques sur la terre et encore plus pour les populations fragiles.Parmi les solutions d'attenuation, une meilleure utilisation du sol est proposee. En effet, les sols ont la plus grande capacite d'echange de carbone avec l'atmosphere et renferment un stock important de carbone. Une augmentation minime du stock de carbone du sol, les echanges de carbone entre l'atmosphere et le sol plus favorables a la sequestration du carbone dans le sol compenseraient les emissions de carbone provenant de la combustion des combustibles fossiles. Cependant, la dynamique du carbone dans le sol souffre encore de connaissances insuffisantes. Il subsiste alors une grande incertitude quant a la reponse du carbone du sol aux changements climatiques et aux changements d'affectation des terres.Plusieurs modeles mecanistiques ont ete developpes pour mieux comprendre la dynamique du carbone du sol. Cependant, ces modeles mecanistes ont encore une vue incomplete des processus physiques affectant la matiere organique (MO) du sol. Il faudra beaucoup de temps pour obtenir un modele complet et a jour de la dynamique des sols.Dans ma these, nous avons propose un modele statistique bayesien visant a decrire la dynamique verticale du carbone du sol. Cela se fait grÃ¢ce a la modelisation du carbone organique du sol et aussi des donnees radiocarbone, car elles illustrent le temps de sejour de la MO et donc la dynamique du carbone du sol. Cette approche statistique visait a mieux representer les incertitudes sur la dynamique du carbone du sol et quantifier les effets des facteurs climatiques et environnementaux sur le carbone des sols superficiels et profonds.Cette meta-analyse a ete realisee sur une base de donnees de 344 profils, collectes a partir de 87 articles scientifiques et archeologiques et paleoclimatologiques, sous differentes conditions climatiques et environnementales.Un modele non lineaire hierarchique avec effets aleatoires a ete propose pour modeliser la dynamique verticale du radiocarbone en fonction de la profondeur. Les techniques de selection bayesiennes, recemment publiees, ont ete appliquees aux couches latentes de notre modele, elles-memes liees par une relation lineaire aux facteurs climatiques et environnementaux. Le Bayesian Group Lasso, le Bayesian Sparse Group Selection(BSGS) et le Bayesian Effect Fusion(BEF) ont ete testes pour identifier les principaux predicteurs explicatifs categoriels et le Stochastic Search Variable Selection pour identifier les predicteurs explicatifs numeriques influents. Une comparaison de ces techniques bayesiennes a ete effectuee sur la base des criteres de selection du modele bayesien pour specifier quel modele a le meilleur pouvoir predictif En plus de la selection de predicteurs categoriels, le BSGS permet de formuler une probabilite d'inclusion a posteriori pour chaque niveau dans les predicteurs categoriels comme type de sol et type d'ecosysteme. En outre, le BEF a permis de fusionner les types de sol et les types dâ€™ecosystemes qui, selon le BEF, sont supposes avoir les memes effets sur nos reponses dâ€™interets que la reponse du radiocarbone du sol arable.L'application de ces techniques a permis de predire, en moyenne et au niveau mondial, la dynamique verticale du radiocarbone dans le cas d'une augmentation de temperature et de changement dâ€™usage des sols. Par exemple, nous avons etudie l'impact de la deforestation des forets tropicales et leur remplacement par des terres cultivees sur la dynamique du carbone du sol. La meme analyse statistique a egalement ete effectuee pour mieux comprendre la dynamique verticale de la teneur en carbone du sol.",2018,
Late embolization of a vascular plug III device after mitral paravalvular leak closure.,"We present a case report of an 80-year-old frail woman with hemolytic anemia and cardiac failure secondary to mitral severe paravalvular regurgitation. Her clinical history was significant for mitral valve replacement that was complicated with a paravalvular leak two months after surgery. The leak was closed percutaneously with an Amplatzer Vascular Plug III single device. A year later she is readmitted with heart failure and the transesophageal echocardiogram revealed a severe paravalvular leak beside the Vascular Plug III device that seemed to be dislodged and rocking. During a new attempt of percutaneous leak closure, while trying to lasso the old device, it embolized to the iliac bifurcation. The old device could be removed from the right femoral artery and the leak could be closed with two new Vascular Plug III devices deployed simultaneously. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of a late embolization of a Vascular Plug III device.",2013,Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions
Robust Estimation of High-Dimensional Mean Regression,"Data subject to heavy-tailed errors are commonly encountered in various scientific fields, especially in the modern era with explosion of massive data. To address this problem, procedures based on quantile regression and Least Absolute Deviation (LAD) regression have been devel- oped in recent years. These methods essentially estimate the conditional median (or quantile) function. They can be very different from the conditional mean functions when distributions are asymmetric and heteroscedastic. How can we efficiently estimate the mean regression functions in ultra-high dimensional setting with existence of only the second moment? To solve this problem, we propose a penalized Huber loss with diverging parameter to reduce biases created by the traditional Huber loss. Such a penalized robust approximate quadratic (RA-quadratic) loss will be called RA-Lasso. In the ultra-high dimensional setting, where the dimensionality can grow exponentially with the sample size, our results reveal that the RA-lasso estimator produces a consistent estimator at the same rate as the optimal rate under the light-tail situation. We further study the computational convergence of RA-Lasso and show that the composite gradient descent algorithm indeed produces a solution that admits the same optimal rate after sufficient iterations. As a byproduct, we also establish the concentration inequality for estimat- ing population mean when there exists only the second moment. We compare RA-Lasso with other regularized robust estimators based on quantile regression and LAD regression. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate the satisfactory finite-sample performance of RA-Lasso.",2014,arXiv: Statistics Theory

Application of ImmunoScore Model for the Differentiation between Active Tuberculosis and Latent Tuberculosis Infection as Well as Monitoring Anti-tuberculosis Therapy,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading global public health problem. To achieve the end TB strategy, non-invasive markers for diagnosis and treatment monitoring of TB disease are urgently needed, especially in high-endemic countries such as China. Interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) and tuberculin skin test (TST), frequently used immunological methods for TB detection, are intrinsically unable to discriminate active tuberculosis (ATB) from latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). Thus, the specificity of these methods in the diagnosis of ATB is dependent upon the local prevalence of LTBI. The pathogen-detecting methods such as acid-fast staining and culture, all have limitations in clinical application. ImmunoScore (IS) is a new promising prognostic tool which was commonly used in tumor. However, the importance of host immunity has also been demonstrated in TB pathogenesis, which implies the possibility of using IS model for ATB diagnosis and therapy monitoring. In the present study, we focused on the performance of IS model in the differentiation between ATB and LTBI and in treatment monitoring of TB disease. We have totally screened five immunological markers (four non-specific markers and one TB-specific marker) and successfully established IS model by using Lasso logistic regression analysis. As expected, the IS model can effectively distinguish ATB from LTBI (with a sensitivity of 95.7% and a specificity of 92.1%) and also has potential value in the treatment monitoring of TB disease.",2017,Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology
Detection of radionuclides from weak and poorly resolved spectra using Lasso and subsampling techniques,"Abstract We consider a problem of identification of nuclides from weak and poorly resolved spectra. A two stage algorithm is proposed and tested based on the principle of majority voting. The idea is to model gamma-ray counts as Poisson processes. Then, the average part is taken to be the model and the difference between the observed gamma-ray counts and the average is considered as random noise. In the linear part, the unknown coefficients correspond to if isotopes of interest are present or absent. Lasso types of algorithms are applied to find non-vanishing coefficients. Since Lasso or any prediction error based algorithm is inconsistent with variable selection for finite data length, an estimate of parameter distribution based on subsampling techniques is added in addition to Lasso. Simulation examples are provided in which the traditional peak detection algorithms fail to work and the proposed two stage algorithm performs well in terms of both the False Negative and False Positive errors.",2011,Radiation Measurements
Selective inference after cross-validation,"This paper describes a method for performing inference on models chosen by cross-validation. When the test error being minimized in cross-validation is a residual sum of squares it can be written as a quadratic form. This allows us to apply the inference framework in Loftus et al. (2015) for models determined by quadratic constraints to the model that minimizes CV test error. Our only requirement on the model training pro- cedure is that its selection events are regions satisfying linear or quadratic constraints. This includes both Lasso and forward stepwise, which serve as our main examples throughout. We do not require knowledge of the error variance $\sigma^2$. The procedures described here are computationally intensive methods of selecting models adaptively and performing inference for the selected model. Implementations are available in an R package.",2015,arXiv: Methodology

Predicting asthma in later childhood: a general and highâ€risk population approach: S59,"Introduction Young children commonly wheeze but only some have asthma later in life. Asthma prediction tools have poor predictive performance and few have been validated. We aimed to develop a robust tool for the prediction of asthma at age 10â€“14 years using readily available information. Methods we studied 5 UK birth cohorts (the STELAR consortium) and considered two groups: 1. all children recruited at birth and 2. high-risk children on the basis of reported wheezing at 2/3 or 5 years. Two comparable cohorts (Ashford and ALSPAC) were used to select predictors (training sample) and the SEATON, MAAS and Isle of Wight studies to assess predictive performance (validation sample). We included 16â€‰187 and 814 children from groups 1 and 2 respectively in the training sample and validated the developed predictive tools in 5320 and 285 children from the validation sample. We considered 40 potential predictors collected at recruitment and at 1, 2/3 and 5 years of age: demographic and perinatal information, eczema, hay-fever, respiratory symptoms, environmental and family-related factors. We defined asthma at 10â€“14 years by the presence of both current wheeze and asthma treatment. We compared 5 statistical methods to select variables and estimate coefficients: stepwise regression, classical (LASSO and Elastic-Net, EN), empirical Bayes (EB) and Bayesian (BM) regularisation Methods Predictive performance was assessed using calibration and discrimination measures including area under the ROC curve (AUC). Results Asthma prevalence at age 10â€“14 ranged from 7%â€“18% in group 1 and from 32%â€“52% in group 2. Frequency of early wheezing, eczema, and paternal asthma were important predictors in all models and both groups. Other selected predictors included birth order, maternal asthma and domestic pets. Specificity and negative predictive value (NPV) were higher in the general population, while sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) were higher in high-risk group. BM (AUC 0.77, specificity 0.84 and NPV 0.93) and EN (AUC 0.74, sensitivity 0.71 and PPV 0.65) provided the highest accuracy and discriminative ability predictive ability in the 2 groups, respectively.

Cerebral vessel anatomy as a predictor of first-pass effect in mechanical thrombectomy for emergent large-vessel occlusion.,"OBJECTIVE
Mechanical thrombectomy is effective in acute ischemic stroke secondary to emergent large-vessel occlusion, but optimal efficacy is contingent on fast and complete recanalization. First-pass recanalization does not occur in the majority of patients. The authors undertook this study to determine if anatomical parameters of the intracranial vessels impact the likelihood of first-pass complete recanalization.


METHODS
The authors retrospectively evaluated data obtained in 230 patients who underwent mechanical thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke secondary to large-vessel occlusion at their institution from 2016 to 2018. Eighty-six patients were identified as having pure M1 occlusions, and 76 were included in the final analysis. The authors recorded and measured clinical and anatomical parameters and evaluated their relationships to the first-pass effect.


RESULTS
The first-pass effect was achieved in 46% of the patients. When a single device was employed, aspiration thrombectomy was more effective than stent retriever thrombectomy. A larger M1 diameter (p = 0.001), decreased vessel diameter tapering between the petrous segment of the internal carotid artery (ICA) and M1 (p < 0.001), and distal collateral grading (p = 0.044) were associated with first-pass recanalization. LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) was used to generate a predictive model for recanalization using anatomical variables.


CONCLUSIONS
The authors demonstrated that a larger M1 vessel diameter, low rate of vessel diameter tapering along the course of the intracranial ICA, and distal collateral status are associated with first-pass recanalization for patients with M1 occlusions.",2020,Journal of neurosurgery
The Inner Life of Objects: Immanent Realism and Speculative Philosophy,"Often a division of concepts can help us better understand unknown or seldom charted philosophical terrain: historically, the distinctions and differences between idealism and materialism have proven helpful, but with Quentin Meillassouxâ€Ÿs concept of correlationism, the divisions between realism and antirealism which once seemed clean-cut are now harder to understand. Graham Harman has gone a step further than Meillassouxâ€Ÿs initial definition of correlationism, by which â€œwe mean the idea according to which we only ever have access to the correlation between thinking and being, and never to either term considered apart from the other,â€ 2 claiming in lectures that those who have pledged fidelity to the realism banner after Meillassoux arenâ€Ÿt realist enough. Instead, says Harman, we should demand that any philosophy which claims to be realist must grant that no entity is more real than any other, whether they be atoms, quarks, institutions, regimes, human beings, bonobos, dreams or distant galaxies. A robust realism must maintain therefore that the universe is composed of objects of all shapes, sizes and types. It is here that I wish to stage something of an intervention; it seems to me that we could rather create a new division to help us understand the contemporary situation facing philosophy based on how various philosophies view objects. I propose that we contrast those philosophies which see objects only working through exterior means (effects) with those which grant some level of (causal) autonomy to objects; in other words, we should compare those philosophies which grant only an outer life to objects with those which also grant them an inner life. A robust realism must not only count objects as means of our causal ends (as in the case of eliminative idealism), or billiard balls in an extended chain of causation (as in the case of eliminative",2011,
Online Sparse System Identification and Signal Reconstruction Using Projections Onto Weighted  $\ell_{1}$ Balls,"This paper presents a novel projection-based adaptive algorithm for sparse signal and system identification. The sequentially observed data are used to generate an equivalent sequence of closed convex sets, namely hyperslabs. Each hyperslab is the geometric equivalent of a cost criterion, that quantifies â€œdata mismatch.â€ Sparsity is imposed by the introduction of appropriately designed weighted â„“1 balls and the related projection operator is also derived. The algorithm develops around projections onto the sequence of the generated hyperslabs as well as the weighted â„“1 balls. The resulting scheme exhibits linear dependence, with respect to the unknown system's order, on the number of multiplications/additions and an O(Llog2L) dependence on sorting operations, where L is the length of the system/signal to be estimated. Numerical results are also given to validate the performance of the proposed method against the Least-Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) algorithm and two very recently developed adaptive sparse schemes that fuse arguments from the LMS/RLS adaptation mechanisms with those imposed by the lasso rational.",2011,IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing
Network structure of depression symptomology in participants with and without depressive disorder: the population-based Health 2000â€“2011 study,"Putative causal relations among depressive symptoms in forms of network structures have been of recent interest, with prior studies suggesting that high connectivity of the symptom network may drive the disease process. We examined in detail the network structure of depressive symptoms among participants with and without depressive disorders (DD; consisting of major depressive disorder (MDD) and dysthymia) at two time points. Participants were from the nationally representative Health 2000 and Health 2011 surveys. In 2000 and 2011, there were 5998 healthy participants (DDâˆ’) and 595 participants with DD diagnosis (DD+). Depressive symptoms were measured using the 13-item version of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Fused Graphical Lasso was used to estimate network structures, and mixed graphical models were used to assess network connectivity and symptom centrality. Network community structure was examined using the walktrap-algorithm and minimum spanning trees (MST). Symptom centrality was evaluated with expected influence and participation coefficients. Overall connectivity did not differ between networks from participants with and without DD, but more simple community structure was observed among those with DD compared to those without DD. Exploratory analyses revealed small differences between the samples in the order of one centrality estimate participation coefficient. Community structure, but not overall connectivity of the symptom network, may be different for people with DD compared to people without DD. This difference may be of importance when estimating the overall connectivity differences between groups with and without mental disorders.",2020,Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology

The Hierarchical Process of Differentiation of Long-Lived Antibody-Secreting Cells Is Dependent on Integrated Signals Derived from Antigen and IL-17A,"Switched CD19-positive memory B cells purified from mice with chronic immune response against Thalassophrynenattereri venom proteins were cultured with venom or cytokines. Our results confirm the existence of a hierarchic process of differentiation: activated memory B cells progressively acquire increasing levels of CD138 and decreasing levels of CD45R/B220 to finally arrive at ASC with B220(neg) phenotype, which are IgG1-secreting cells. Only Bmem from peritoneal cavity or bone marrow of VTn immunized mice presented the capacity to generate ASC functionally active. IL-17A or IL-21/IL-23/IL-33 improves the ability of venom to induce intracellular IgG of peritoneal derived-ASC. Cognate stimulation with venom and IL-17A is sufficient to down-regulate the expression of CD45R/B220. BAFF-R is up-regulated in splenic or medullar derived-ASC stimulated by venom, CpG or cytokines. Only splenic derived-ASC up-regulate Bcl-2 expression after CpG or the combination of IL-21/IL-23/IL-33 stimulation. Finally, the activation of ASC for IgG1 secretion is triggered by venom proteins in peritoneal cavity and by IL-17A in medullar niche. These results show the importance of the integration of signals downstream of BCR and IL17-A receptors in modulating ASC differentiation, focusing in the microenvironment niche of their generation.",2013,PLoS ONE
Fast global convergence of gradient methods for high-dimensional statistical recovery,"Many statistical $M$-estimators are based on convex optimization problems formed by the combination of a data-dependent loss function with a norm-based regularizer. We analyze the convergence rates of projected gradient and composite gradient methods for solving such problems, working within a high-dimensional framework that allows the data dimension $\pdim$ to grow with (and possibly exceed) the sample size $\numobs$. This high-dimensional structure precludes the usual global assumptions---namely, strong convexity and smoothness conditions---that underlie much of classical optimization analysis. We define appropriately restricted versions of these conditions, and show that they are satisfied with high probability for various statistical models. Under these conditions, our theory guarantees that projected gradient descent has a globally geometric rate of convergence up to the \emph{statistical precision} of the model, meaning the typical distance between the true unknown parameter $\theta^*$ and an optimal solution $\hat{\theta}$. This result is substantially sharper than previous convergence results, which yielded sublinear convergence, or linear convergence only up to the noise level. Our analysis applies to a wide range of $M$-estimators and statistical models, including sparse linear regression using Lasso ($\ell_1$-regularized regression); group Lasso for block sparsity; log-linear models with regularization; low-rank matrix recovery using nuclear norm regularization; and matrix decomposition. Overall, our analysis reveals interesting connections between statistical precision and computational efficiency in high-dimensional estimation.",2011,ArXiv

Asynchronous Doubly Stochastic Sparse Kernel Learning,"Kernel methods have achieved tremendous success in the past two decades. In the current big data era, data collection has grown tremendously. However, existing kernel methods are not scalable enough both at the training and predicting steps. To address this challenge, in this paper, we first introduce a general sparse kernel learning formulation based on the random feature approximation, where the loss functions are possibly non-convex. Then we propose a new asynchronous parallel doubly stochastic algorithm for large scale sparse kernel learning (AsyDSSKL). To the best our knowledge, AsyDSSKL is the first algorithm with the techniques of asynchronous parallel computation and doubly stochastic optimization. We also provide a comprehensive convergence guarantee to AsyDSSKL. Importantly, the experimental results on various large-scale real-world datasets show that, our AsyDSSKL method has the significant superiority on the computational efficiency at the training and predicting steps over the existing kernel methods. Introduction Kernel methods have achieved tremendous success in the past two decades for non-linear learning problems. There are a large number of successful and popular kernel methods (Vapnik 1998; Zhu and Hastie 2005; Zhu et al. 2004; Baudat and Anouar 2000; Vovk 2013; Li, Yang, and Xing 2005) for various learning problems. We take binary classification and regression for example. Support vector classification (SVC) (Vapnik 1998), kernel logistic regression (Zhu and Hastie 2005) and 1-norm SVC (Zhu et al. 2004) are the popular kernel methods for binary classification. Support vector regression (Vapnik 1998), kernel ridge regression (Vovk 2013) and kernel Lasso (Li, Yang, and Xing 2005) are the popular kernel methods for regression. These kernel methods have been successfully applied to solve various real-world applications (such as computational biology (SchÃ¶lkopf, Tsuda, and Vert 2004) and remote sensing data analysis (CampsValls and Bruzzone 2009)). However, traditional kernel methods need to store and compute the kernel matrix with the size of O(l) where l is the training sample size. When l is large, the kernel matrix can be neither stored in local memory nor computed. Even *To whom all correspondence should be addressed.

All rights reserved. worse, the kernel methods normally have the computational complexity O(l) for the training. To address the scalability issue of kernel methods in the training step, several decomposition algorithms (Takahashi and Nishi 2006) have been proposed for training the kernel methods. However, even for the state-of-the-art implementations (e.g. LIBSVM software package), the observed computational complexity is O(l) where 1 < Îº < 2.3 (Chang and Lin 2011a). More related works of training kernel methods are discussed in the next section. To sum up, in the current big data era, the existing kernel methods are not scalable enough at the training step. Besides the scalability issue at the training step, traditional kernel methods are also not scalable at the predicting step. Specifically, the computational complexity for predicting a testing sample is O(l), because normally the number of support vectors grows linearly with the sample size. Thus, the computational complexity of predicting a testing set with similar size of training set is O(l). To address the scalability issue of kernel methods in the predicting step, a compact (or sparse) model is preferred. The direct method for obtaining a compact model is adding sparse constraint (normally 1norm) on the coefficients of the model. For example, (Zhu et al. 2004) imposed the 1-norm on the SVC formulation. (Yen et al. 2014) imposed 1-norm on the random features. Li, Yang, and Xing (2005) reformulated Lasso into a form isomorphic to SVC, which generates a sparse solution in the nonlinear feature space. However, these methods are not scalable at the training step. To address the scalability issues of kernel methods at the training and predicting steps, in this paper, we first introduce a general sparse kernel learning formulation with the random feature approximation, where the loss functions are possibly non-convex. Then, we propose a new asynchronous parallel doubly stochastic algorithm for sparse kernel learning (AsyDSSKL). We believe this is very important for kernel methods for four reasons. 1) Generality: AsyDSSKL works for a general class of sparse kernel methods based on the random feature approximation, where the loss function is possibly non-convex. 2) Efficient computation: The pivotal step of AsyDSSKL is to compute the doubly stochastic gradient on a mini-batch of samples and a selected coordinate, which is quite efficient. 3) Comprehensive convergence guarantees: AsyDSSKL achieves a sublinear rate when the smooth loss functions are convex or non-convex.

"Patients infected by tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus facing their disease, their reactions to disease diagnosis and its implication about their families and communities, in Burkina Faso: a mixed focus group and cross sectional study","BackgroundPatients facing tuberculosis (TB) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection receive particular care. Despite efforts in the care, misconceptions about TB and HIV still heavily impact patients, their families and communities. This situation severely limits achievement of TB and HIV programs goals. This study reports current situation of TB patients and patients living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) facing their disease and its implications, by comparing results from both qualitative and quantitative study design.MethodsCross sectional study using mixed methods was used and excluded patients co-infected by TB and HIV. Focus group included 96 patients (6 patients per group) stratified by setting, disease profile and gender; from rural (Orodara Health District) and urban (Bobo Dioulasso) areas, all from Hauts-Bassins region in Burkina Faso. Quantitative study included 862 patients (309Â TB patients and 553 PLWHA) attending TB and HIV care facilities in two main regions (Hauts-Bassins and Centre) of Burkina Faso.ResultsA content analysis of reports found TB patients and PLWHA felt discriminated and stigmatized because of misconceptions with its aftermaths (rejection, emotional and financial problems), mainly among PLWHA and women patients. PLWHA go to healers when facing limited solutions in health system. There are fewer associations for TB patients, and less education and sensitization sessions to give them opportunity for sharing disease status and learning from other TB patients. TB patients and PLWHA still need to better understand their disease and its implication. Access to care (diagnosis and treatment) remains one of the key issues in health system, especially for PLWHA. Individual counseling is centered among PLWHA but not for TB patients. With research progress and experiences sharing, TB patients and PLWHA have some hope to implement their life project, and to receive psychosocial and nutritional support.ConclusionDespite international aid, TB patients and PLWHA are facing misconceptions effects. There is a need to reinforce health education towards patients and healers, inside community, health centers and associations, and for specific settings. International aid must be adapted to specific targets and strategies implementing programs. Maintaining psychosocial and nutritional support is crucial for better outcomes of medication adherence. Individual counseling has to be centered among TB patients and PLWHA.",2016,BMC Research Notes

Prediction of Length of Stay on the Intensive Care Unit Based on Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator,"Length of stay (LoS) in the intensive care unit (ICU) is a common outcome measure used as an indicator of both quality of care and resource use. However, the existing analysis methods of LoS are poorly interpretable and extensible, and there is controversial for the predictive performance of LoS. In this paper, the study includes data from 1,214 unplanned ICU admissions to participate in the ICU of Sichuan Provincial Peopleâ€™s Hospital between Dec. 11, 2015 and Dec. 6, 2018. On the basis of these data, this study creates a highly accurate and predictive model using advanced preprocessing techniques, exploratory data analysis (EDA) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm. Next, this study evaluates the predictive performance of the proposed model by 10-fold cross validation and external validation method using the root mean square prediction error (RMSPE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination ( $R^{2}$ ). The predictive performance of the proposed model is 0.88Â±0.13 day for RMSPE, 0.87Â±0.07 day for MAE and 0.35Â±0.09 for  $R^{2}$ . Experimental results show that the performance of the proposed method are competitive with the state-of-the-art methods and results. Furthermore, this study explores the risk factors for ICU LoS in survivors and non-survivors and compare their predictive performance.",2019,IEEE Access
Using Network Analysis for Examining Interpersonal Emotion Dynamics.,"Several contemporary models conceptualize emotion as inherently interpersonal. We demonstrate how network analysis, a class of statistical methods often used to examine intrapersonal dynamic processes, provides a potential avenue for parameterizing interpersonal emotion dynamics (and interpersonal dynamics in general). We claim that this method allows (a) observing interpersonal dynamics at various temporal levels; (b) examining interpersonal dynamics occurring through various emotional pathways; and (c) capturing variations in interpersonal networks, which can subsequently be used to predict changes in outcomes. To demonstrate the potential of this method, we used dyadic daily diary data on emotion dynamics from two samples; Sample 1 involved couples in their routine daily lives, whereas Sample 2 involved couples in their transition to parenthood. Graphical Multilevel-Vector-Autoregressive modeling was used to estimate partners' emotional networks, whereas in a second step, LASSO was used to test the predictive value of couple-level differences of the obtained networks. The analysis revealed several patterns. For example, the between-couple network of Sample 1 was more interpersonally dense, but couple-level differences in the networks' interpersonal associations were predictive of partners' relationship satisfaction over time only in Sample 2. We also include commented code implementing a new dyadmlvar R package developed for conducting this analysis.",2019,Multivariate behavioral research
"A new technique to improve tissue grip: ""the lasso-loop stitch"".","In the chain of reattachment of the rotator cuff, links extend from the tendon to the anchor within the bone. Passage of the suture through the tendon is noted at the start of the chain, but as shown before, this is most vulnerable, depending on the quality of the tendon. We present a new technique of suture placement designed to improve tissue grip: ""The lasso-loop stitch."" One side of the wire is passed through the edge of the tendon, which is ruptured by the wire in the middle-not at the end. The wire is not pulled through completely. Through this process, a loop is created at the upper side of the tendon. The end of the wire, at the same side used to make the loop, is passed through the loop with a grasp. The wire is passed through the loop, and the end of the wire is brought extra-articularly. Through this technique, the reduction force of a suture is augmented, and a constricting factor is added. We have not changed the location of the anchors. So far, we have used the technique in rotator cuff repair, biceps tenodesis, and the Bankart procedure.",2006,Arthroscopy : the journal of arthroscopic & related surgery : official publication of the Arthroscopy Association of North America and the International Arthroscopy Association
"A New Blood Fluke, Hapalorhynchus beadlei n. sp. (Spirorchiidae), and a Note on Allossostomoides (Paramphistomidae), in Pelusios williamsi lutescens from Uganda","Blood flukes (Spirorchiidae) of the genus Hapalorhynchus have not been reported previously from African turtles. H. beadlei n. sp. is described and figured from the side-necked turtle, Pelusios williamsi lutescens, in Uganda. Comparisons are made with all previously known species, and all of these are from North America. P. w. lutescens harbored immature specimens of Allassostomoides sp., also unreported from African turtles; these specimens are briefly described and figured. In 1958, a large furcocercus cercaria belonging to a family of turtle blood flukes, Spirorchiidae, was found in the snail Biomphalaria sudanica (Von Martens) along the margin of Lake Victoria near Kampala, Uganda. Cercariae were found subsequently on many occasions in the same snail host from other locations, but adult spirorchiids were not found in East African turtles until 1969. A side-necked turtle, Pelusios williamsi lutescens Laurent. (Syn. Pelusios nigricans), collected near Kampala, was found to be heavily infected with adult blood flukes of the genus Hapalorhynchus Stunkard, 1922. A second turtle of the same species, collected in 1970 from Queen Elizabeth National Park in southwestern Uganda, also harbored adult worms and many eggs of the same species of trematode. MATERIALS AND METHODS The turtles were decapitated. The blood drained into shallow pans containing decoagulant was examined for spirorchiids. When found, they were pipetted into dishes of saline. The plastron was removed from the turtle and internal organs, including heart, lungs, liver, and major blood vessels, were examined. Parasites were fixed in AFA. Some were removed prior to fixation and examined under moderate pressure from coverglasses or slide fragments I am grateful to Dr. Martin J. Ulmer for his helpful suggestions and constructive criticisms contributing to the final version of the manuscript.

"[Archaeal diversity in sediment of Dunbasitawu salt lake, Xinjiang, China, estimated by 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses].","OBJECTIVE
We surveyed the composition and diversity of uncultured archaea in Xinjiang Dunbasitawu salt Lake sediment.


METHODS
Environmental total DNA was directly extracted from the sediment. We constructed clone library of 16S rRNA gene amplified with archaea-specific primers. A total of 59 positive clones were randomly selected from the library and identified by restriction length polymorphism (RFLP) with enzyme Hae III. Clones with the unique RFLP pattern were sequenced, and then by phylogenetic analysis.


RESULTS
The clone coverage C value was 89%, and Shannon-Wiener index was 2.69. In total, 21 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) were obtained and affiliated with Euryarchaeota (92%) and Crenarchaeota (8%). The most of clones were affiliated to Halobacterium (24%), Haloarcula (18%), Natronorubrum (14%), and Halorubrum (8%), which belonged to family Halobacteriaceae (88%) with high similarity to that from thalassohaline environment. In addition, 11% of clones had less than 97% similarity with archaea sequences deposited in GenBank database.


CONCLUSION
Compared with other similar Hypersaline environments, archaea diversity in Dunbasitawu salt lake was a little lower. The proportion of archara was different, but the composition is consistent. It was implied that some potential new species or lineages maybe exist in Dunbasitawu salt lake.",2012,Wei sheng wu xue bao = Acta microbiologica Sinica
Young infants can learn object and action-words from continuous audiovisual streams,"This doctoral thesis explored whether and how preverbal infants can discovernovel words associated with objects and actions from a continuous audiovisual stream.Specifically, we tested infants on their ability to associate a novel word that systematicallyco-occurred with a stationary face (for object-words) and a novel word that systematicallyco-occurred with moving faces (for action-words). Moreover, this doctoral thesis seeks toexplore what phonological cues infants rely on and will help to succeed in this learningprocess and also if infants can generalize the learning of action-words into new visualstimuli.In study 1 we tested 5-month-old infants on the learning of these two types ofwords from a continuous audiovisual task. The results showed that in global, most infantslearned the image-word associations, however, some of them learned only the objectwords,other only the action-words and others succeeded to learn both. We interpretedsuch pattern of the results as an index of the interindividual variability especially relatedto the cognitive resources that the infants recruited to solve the task.In study 2, in a series of 4 experiments, we evaluated older infants i.e. 8-montholdinfants and we facilitated the task by adding vowel or consonant harmony to either theobject or the action words. The results showed that infants were able to learn both objectsand action-words from the continuous audiovisual streams only when words conveyedvowel harmony. We interpreted these results as vowels may have a role in early ages dueto the perceptual salience in audiovisual task.An additional experiment in progress, evaluated whether ~7-month-old infantsgeneralized the learning of novel action-words to novel agents (novel moving faces notpresented during familiarization). Our results indicated that infants failed to generalizeaction words to new agents. In sum, the results of these thesis showed that from very earlyages infants can associate what they hear with what they see from continuous audiovisualstreams, when audiovisual stimuli are interesting and facilitated the task. Such initialassociations might correspond to primary forms of the word-mapping observed later stepsof language acquisition.",2018,

High-dimensional robust approximated M-estimators for mean regression with asymmetric data,"Asymmetry along with heteroscedasticity or contamination often occurs with the growth of data dimensionality. In ultra-high dimensional data analysis, such irregular settings are usually overlooked for both theoretical and computational convenience. In this paper, we establish a framework for estimation in high-dimensional regression models using Penalized Robust Approximated quadratic M-estimators (PRAM). This framework allows general settings such as random errors lack of symmetry and homogeneity, or the covariates are not sub-Gaussian. To reduce the possible bias caused by the data's irregularity in mean regression, PRAM adopts a loss function with a flexible robustness parameter growing with the sample size. Theoretically, we first show that, in the ultra-high dimension setting, PRAM estimators have local estimation consistency at the minimax rate enjoyed by the LS-Lasso. Then we show that PRAM with an appropriate non-convex penalty in fact agrees with the local oracle solution, and thus obtain its oracle property. Computationally, we demonstrate the performances of six PRAM estimators using three types of loss functions for approximation (Huber, Tukey's biweight and Cauchy loss) combined with two types of penalty functions (Lasso and MCP). Our simulation studies and real data analysis demonstrate satisfactory finite sample performances of the PRAM estimator under general irregular settings.",2019,arXiv: Statistics Theory
Covariate selection with group lasso and doubly robust estimation of causal effects.,"The efficiency of doubly robust estimators of the average causal effect (ACE) of a treatment can be improved by including in the treatment and outcome models only those covariates which are related to both treatment and outcome (i.e., confounders) or related only to the outcome. However, it is often challenging to identify such covariates among the large number that may be measured in a given study. In this article, we propose GLiDeR (Group Lasso and Doubly Robust Estimation), a novel variable selection technique for identifying confounders and predictors of outcome using an adaptive group lasso approach that simultaneously performs coefficient selection, regularization, and estimation across the treatment and outcome models. The selected variables and corresponding coefficient estimates are used in a standard doubly robust ACE estimator. We provide asymptotic results showing that, for a broad class of data generating mechanisms, GLiDeR yields a consistent estimator of the ACE when either the outcome or treatment model is correctly specified. A comprehensive simulation study shows that GLiDeR is more efficient than doubly robust methods using standard variable selection techniques and has substantial computational advantages over a recently proposed doubly robust Bayesian model averaging method. We illustrate our method by estimating the causal treatment effect of bilateral versus single-lung transplant on forced expiratory volume in one year after transplant using an observational registry.",2018,Biometrics
Monoamines stimulate sex reversal in the saddleback wrasse.,"Monoamine neurotransmitters (norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin) play an important role in reproduction and sexual behavior throughout the vertebrates. They are the first endogenous chemical signals in the regulation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. In teleosts with behavioral sex determination, much is known about behavioral cues that induce sex reversal. The cues are social, processed via the visual system and depend on the ratio of females to males in the population. The mechanisms by which these external behavioral cues are converted to an internal chemical regulatory process are largely unknown. The protogynous Hawaiian saddleback wrasse, Thalassoma duperrey, was used to investigate the biological pathway mediating the conversion of a social cue into neuroendocrine events regulating sex reversal. Because monoamines play an important role in the regulation of the HPG axis, they were selected as likely candidates for such a conversion. To determine if monoamines could affect sex reversal, drugs affecting monoamines were used in an attempt to either induce sex reversal under non-permissive conditions, or prevent sex reversal under permissive conditions. Increasing norepinephrine or blocking dopamine or serotonin lead to sex reversal in experimental animals under non-permissive conditions. Increasing serotonin blocked sex reversal under permissive conditions, while blocking dopamine or norepinephrine retarded the process. The results presented here demonstrate that monoamines contribute significantly to the control sex reversal. Norepinephrine stimulates initiation and completion of gonadal sex of reversal as well as color change perhaps directly via its effects on the HPG axis. Dopamine exercises inhibitory action on the initiation of sex reversal while 5-HT inhibits both initiation and completion of sex reversal. The serotonergic system appears to be an integral part of the pathway mediating the conversion of a social cue into a neuroendocrine event. The complex organization of neurochemical events controlling the psychosocial, physiological, and anatomical events that constitute reversal of sexual identity includes monoamine neurotransmitters.",2003,General and comparative endocrinology
The Constrained Lasso,"Motivated by applications in areas as diverse as finance, image reconstruction, and curve estimation, we introduce the constrained lasso problem, where the underlying parameters satisfy a collection of linear constraints. We show that many statistical methods, such as the fused lasso, monotone curve estimation and the generalized lasso, are all special cases of the constrained lasso. Computing the constrained lasso poses some technical challenges but we develop an efficient algorithm for fitting it over a grid of tuning parameters. Non-asymptotic error bounds are developed which suggest that the constrained lasso should outperform the lasso in situations where the true parameters satisfy the underlying constraints. Extensive numerical experiments show that our method performs well, both computationally and statistically. Finally, we apply the constrained lasso to a real data set to estimate the demand curve for a particular type of auto loan as a function of interest rate, and demonstrate that it can outperform more standard approaches. Some key words: Lasso; Linear constraints; Penalized regression; Demand function; Generalized lasso",2012,
Network inference in matrix-variate Gaussian models with non-independent noise,"Inferring a graphical model or network from observational data from a large number of variables is a well studied problem in machine learning and computational statistics. In this paper we consider a version of this problem that is relevant to the analysis of multiple phenotypes collected in genetic studies. In such datasets we expect correlations between phenotypes and between individuals. We model observations as a sum of two matrix normal variates such that the joint covariance function is a sum of Kronecker products. This model, which generalizes the Graphical Lasso, assumes observations are correlated due to known genetic relationships and corrupted with non-independent noise. We have developed a computationally efficient EM algorithm to fit this model. On simulated datasets we illustrate substantially improved performance in network reconstruction by allowing for a general noise distribution.",2013,arXiv: Methodology
Review of Modern Logistic Regression Methods with Application to Small and Medium Sample Size Problems,"Logistic regression is one of the most widely applied machine learning tools in binary classification problems. Traditionally, inference of logistic models has focused on stepwise regression procedures which determine the predictor variables to be included in the model. Techniques that modify the log-likelihood by adding a continuous penalty function of the parameters have recently been used when inferring logistic models with a large number of predictor variables. This paper compares and contrasts three popular penalized logistic regression methods: ridge regression, the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and the elastic net. The methods are compared in terms of prediction accuracy using simulated data as well as real data sets.",2010,
Ein T-Zell assoziiertes Hypereosinophilie-Syndrom (L-HES) als Differenzialdiagnose eines Asthma bronchiale,"Ein 13 Jahre alter Junge wurde zur Abklarung eines Asthma bronchiale aufgenommen.

In der Lungenfunktion konnte eine Obstruktion (FEV1 38%) nachgewiesen werden. Radiologisch zeigten sich Bronchiektasien und mucous pluggine. In der BAL fiel eine Eosinophilie (76%) mit erhohtem IL-5 auf. Histologisch fand sich das Bild eines Asthma bronchiale mit einer Mukostase in Form von Curschmann-Spiralen, eine Hypertrophie der Bronchialwandmuskulatur sowie eine Lungeneosinophilie. Eine ABPA, ein Churg-Strauss-Syndrom, eine Parasitose, eine arzneimittelassoziierte HE, Allergien sowie eine maligne Grunderkrankung konnten ausgeschlossen werden.

Large Multistream Data Analytics for Monitoring and Diagnostics in Manufacturing Systems,"The high-dimensionality and volume of large scale multistream data has inhibited significant research progress in developing an integrated monitoring and diagnostics (M&D) approach. This data, also categorized as big data, is becoming common in manufacturing plants. In this paper, we propose an integrated M\&D approach for large scale streaming data. We developed a novel monitoring method named Adaptive Principal Component monitoring (APC) which adaptively chooses PCs that are most likely to vary due to the change for early detection. Importantly, we integrate a novel diagnostic approach, Principal Component Signal Recovery (PCSR), to enable a streamlined SPC. This diagnostics approach draws inspiration from Compressed Sensing and uses Adaptive Lasso for identifying the sparse change in the process. We theoretically motivate our approaches and do a performance evaluation of our integrated M&D method through simulations and case studies.",2018,ArXiv
Children's understanding of the pretenceâ€“reality distinction: a review of current theory and evidence,"This paper provides an update on the current status of theory and evidence relating to children's understanding of the pretenceâ€“reality distinction. The paper starts by highlighting the striking paradox between children's early competence in pretence and their experiences of pretenceâ€“reality confusions as late as middle childhood. This is followed by a detailed review of various theories that have been offered to explain this phenomenon. Specifically, theories attributing the paradoxical findings to methodological differences between studies are reviewed and dismissed before considering the transmigration and availability hypotheses (Harris, Brown, Marriott, Whittall & Harmer, 1991; Johnson & Harris, 1994), the role of context and the child's emotional involvement in the pretence, and the pretence continuation account (Golomb & Galasso, 1995). It is argued that none of these theories alone can explain pretenceâ€“reality confusions and that these are best explained in terms of the combined influences of cognitive availability, empirical evidence of reality, context, affect and individual differences. Further research is necessary to fully explore the nature, cause and developmental trajectory of individual differences in this domain.",2002,Developmental Science

"Abundance and species composition of non-geniculate coralline red algae epiphytic on the South African populations of the rocky shore seagrass Thalassodendron leptocaule M.C. Duarte, Bandeira & Romeiras","Seagrasses support a great diversity of epiphytic organisms and new research has shown that non-geniculate coralline red algae are important occupiers of space on the fronds of seagrasses. Except for a few scant records, there are no detailed published accounts of non-geniculate coralline algae epiphytic on seagrasses in South Africa. The seagrass Thalassodendron leptocaule (previously known as Thalassodendron ciliatum) is unique among southern African seagrasses in that it occurs on exposed rocky outcrops along the Mozambique and north eastern South African coast; most other seagrasses are restricted to sheltered bays and estuaries. Here we present descriptions of three species of non-geniculate coralline red algae which we have identified growing epiphytically on this seagrass in northern KwaZulu-Natal: Hydrolithon farinosum, Pneophyllum amplexifrons and Synarthrophyton patena. Two of the corallines (P. amplexifrons and S. patena) were restricted to the seagrass' stems while the third (H. farinosum) occurred only on the leaves. Of the three coralline epiphytes, P. amplexifrons contributed most to the biomass (average wet weight per plant 0.6Â±1.18 g); its wet weight, however, varied between habitats. Hydrolithon farinosum and other smaller turf algae amounted to no more than 0.1 g (wet weight) per leaf. Synarthrophyton patena was far more sparsely evident and contributed to less than 0.1 g (wet weight) per stem. Pneophyllum amplexifrons and H. farinosum appear to be pioneer epiphytes and form additional surfaces onto which other seaweed epiphytes attach and grow. Distribution of these epiphytes is explained by the longevity of the stems and leaves of the seagrass.",2013,South African Journal of Botany

Many inflammatory mediators may have biomarker utility. To identify synovium related to knee OA pain biomarkers, we used canonical correlation analysis to analyze the miRNA-mRNA dual expression profiling data and extracted the miRNAs and mRNAs. After identifying miRNAs and mRNAs, we built an interaction network by integrating miRWalk2.0. /en, we extended the network by increasing miRNA-mRNA pairs and identified five miRNAs and four genes (TGFBR2, DST, TBXAS1, and FHLI) through the Spearman rank correlation test. For miRNAs involved in the network, we further performed the Gene Ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) functional enrichment analyses, whereafter only those mRNAs overlapped with the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) genetic database were analyzed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and support vector machine (SVM) classification were taken into the analysis. /e results demonstrated that all the recognized miRNAs and their gene targets in the network might be potential biomarkers for synovialassociated pain in knee OA. /is study predicts the underlying risk biomarkers of synovium pain in knee OA.",2019,

Congenital thoracic extradural cysts,"SummaryTwo thoracic extradural cysts are described which occurred in the same patient.

A Lasso multi-marker mixed model for association mapping with population structure correction,"MOTIVATION
Exploring the genetic basis of heritable traits remains one of the central challenges in biomedical research. In traits with simple Mendelian architectures, single polymorphic loci explain a significant fraction of the phenotypic variability. However, many traits of interest seem to be subject to multifactorial control by groups of genetic loci. Accurate detection of such multivariate associations is non-trivial and often compromised by limited statistical power. At the same time, confounding influences, such as population structure, cause spurious association signals that result in false-positive findings.


RESULTS
We propose linear mixed models LMM-Lasso, a mixed model that allows for both multi-locus mapping and correction for confounding effects. Our approach is simple and free of tuning parameters; it effectively controls for population structure and scales to genome-wide datasets. LMM-Lasso simultaneously discovers likely causal variants and allows for multi-marker-based phenotype prediction from genotype. We demonstrate the practical use of LMM-Lasso in genome-wide association studies in Arabidopsis thaliana and linkage mapping in mouse, where our method achieves significantly more accurate phenotype prediction for 91% of the considered phenotypes. At the same time, our model dissects the phenotypic variability into components that result from individual single nucleotide polymorphism effects and population structure. Enrichment of known candidate genes suggests that the individual associations retrieved by LMM-Lasso are likely to be genuine.

Utilizing longitudinal microbiome taxonomic profiles to predict food allergy via Long Short-Term Memory networks,"Food allergy is usually difficult to diagnose in early life, and the inability to diagnose patients with atopic diseases at an early age may lead to severe complications. Numerous studies have suggested an association between the infant gut microbiome and development of allergy. In this work, we investigated the capacity of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict food allergies in early life (0-3 years) from subjects' longitudinal gut microbiome profiles. Using the DIABIMMUNE dataset, we show an increase in predictive power using our model compared to Hidden Markov Model, Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and LASSO regression. We further evaluated whether the training of LSTM networks benefits from reduced representations of microbial features. We considered sparse autoencoder for extraction of potential latent representations in addition to standard feature selection procedures based on Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) and variance prior to the training of LSTM networks. The comprehensive evaluation reveals that LSTM networks with the mRMR selected features achieve significantly better performance compared to the other tested machine learning models.",2019,PLoS Computational Biology
Adaptive Elastic Net : An Improvement of Elastic Net to achieve Oracle Properties,"Lasso proved to be an extremely successful technique for simultaneous estimation and variable selection. However lasso has two major drawbacks. First, it does not capture any grouping effect and secondly in some situations lasso solutions are inconsistent. To overcome inconsistency recently adaptive lasso was proposed where adaptive weights are used for penalizing different coefficients. Adaptive lasso enjoys oracle properties. Also recently a doubly regularized technique namely elastic net was proposed which encourages grouping effect i.e. either selection or omission of the correlated variable together and is particularly useful when the number of covariates (p) is much larger than the number of observations (n). However even for usual p < n case it does not deemed to be an oracle procedure. In this paper we propose a new version of the elastic net called adaptive elastic net which inherits some of the desirable properties of the adaptive lasso and elastic net. We explicitly prove its oracle properties for p < n case. An efficient algorithm was proposed in the line of LARS-EN which is then illustrated with simulated as well as real life data examples.",2007,
Performance of the T2Bacteria Panel for Diagnosing Bloodstream Infections,"Supplement. Study Protocol Early institution of appropriate antimicrobial therapy is a crucial determinant of improved outcomes in patients with bloodstream infections (BSIs), particularly those causing sepsis (14). Blood cultures are the gold standard for diagnosing BSIs but are limited by prolonged time to results and sensitivities ranging from 10% or less to about 50% in cases of suspected bacteremia, febrile neutropenia, severe sepsis, and septic shock (5, 6). The inadequacies of blood cultures and the need for early treatment of BSIs provide a rationale for empirical use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. In a meta-analysis of sepsis treatment studies, empirical antibiotic therapy was inappropriate in 46.5% of patients, and the mortality rate in these patients was higher than among those receiving appropriate treatment (7). The development of nonculture diagnostic tests for BSIs that are rapid and accurate is therefore a top priority (810). Recently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared 2 nonculture diagnostic tests that use T2 magnetic resonance to identify pathogens in whole blood samples. The T2Candida and T2Bacteria Panels (T2 Biosystems) are the first FDA-cleared tests that directly detect multiple species of fungi and bacteria in whole blood samples without the need for cultivating organisms. In both panels, fully automated testing of whole blood collected in a standard Vacutainer (Becton Dickinson) is performed by a dedicated instrument platform (T2Dx). T2Dx amplifies microbial cellassociated DNA using a thermostable polymerase and target-specific primers and detects signals by amplicon-induced agglomeration of superparamagnetic particles and T2 magnetic resonance. The T2Bacteria Panel detects the 5 most common ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli). These species generally account for about 50% of organisms recovered from positive blood cultures and are notable for their propensity for resistance to multiple antibiotics (1113). In a single-center pilot study, a research prototype of T2Bacteria had sensitivity of 83% and specificity of 98% for diagnosing BSIs caused by targeted bacteria (14). The objective of this study was to determine the performance of the commercially available, FDA-cleared version of the T2Bacteria Panel in identifying 5 target bacteria among patients for whom blood cultures were ordered as standard of care. Methods Study Design This was a prospective multicenter study to evaluate the performance of the T2Bacteria Panel in diagnosing BSI. Participants were enrolled at 11 U.S. acute care hospitals (Appendix Table 1). The institutional review board at each site approved the study protocol, which was finalized on 20 August 2015. Patients were enrolled from 8 December 2015 through 4 August 2017. Appendix Table 1. Description of the 11 Medical Centers Involved in the Study Study Population Hospitalized patients aged 18 years or older who had a diagnostic blood culture ordered as standard of care for suspected BSI or sepsis were eligible for the study (Figure 1). No specific criteria were used to define suspected BSI or sepsis; blood culture was ordered at the discretion of the treating physician. Potential participants were excluded if they had previous specimens tested by the T2Bacteria Panel; if they had a comorbid condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, could limit participation; or if they had received any investigational, novel drug compound within 30 days before enrollment. Figure 1. Flow chart for patient recruitment and enrollment. Measurements Aerobic and anaerobic blood cultures (1 bottle each, referred to as companion blood cultures) and whole blood samples (n= 3 for T2Bacteria testing) were collected in that order and from the same anatomical site. Companion blood cultures (5 to 10 mL of whole blood per bottle) were performed in accordance with hospital practices and manufacturer recommendations (BacT/ALERT [BioMrieux], BACTEC FX [Becton Dickinson], or VersaTREK [Thermo Fisher Scientific]). Bacteria in positive cultures were identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Bruker Daltronics or BioMrieux) or VITEK 2 (BioMrieux). Blood cultures that did not yield an organism were incubated for at least 5 days. For T2Bacteria, at least 3 mL was collected in 4-mL dipotassium EDTA Vacutainer tubes supplied by T2 Biosystems. The first tube was tested on a T2Dx instrument at each site. T2Bacteria was tested on a 50/50 mix of samples that were freshly collected and those that were thawed after storage at 70C. The 95% CIs for positive and negative percentage agreement with blood cultures overlapped between fresh and frozen samples. The second and third T2Bacteria tubes were stored at 70C for backup test runs. A synthetic DNA target was included with each run as an internal control. T2Bacteria results were reported as positive or negative for each targeted species. In analytic verification studies, the limit of detection was determined by spiking whole blood specimens with multiple concentrations of the species detected by the T2Bacteria Panel. The limit of detection was defined as the lowest bacterial concentration (in colony-forming units per milliliter) detected in at least 95% of contrived samples, as established by testing of at least 20 replicates of 2 strains of each species. The limits of detection ranged from 2 to 11 CFU/mL (Appendix Table 2). Appendix Table 2. Limit of Detection for Each Bacterium Included in the T2Bacteria Panel T2Bacteria results were not available to health care teams caring for study patients and did not affect clinical decision making. Health care teams were permitted to order additional blood cultures and other types of cultures at their discretion or at any time without input from the research team; these are referred to as clinical cultures to distinguish them from companion blood culture specimens collected concurrently with T2Bacteria samples. Demographic, clinical, and microbiological data were extracted by using a case report form. Definitions For purposes of data analysis, a companion blood culture was positive if an organism targeted by the T2Bacteria panel was recovered from at least 1 of the 2 bottles in the set. The T2Bacteria result was considered positive if 1 or more target bacteria were detected and negative if none were detected. Proven BSI was defined as a positive blood culture using a concurrently drawn specimen. Probable BSI was defined as a negative blood culture but a positive T2Bacteria result if the T2Bacteria-detected organism was isolated within 21 days from a clinical blood culture specimen collected at a different time or from another site (such as the abdomen, urine, or lungs), indicating a plausible cause of infection. Possible BSI was defined as a negative blood culture but a positive T2Bacteria result in the absence of supporting culture data if the T2Bacteria-detected organism was a plausible cause of disease (for example, E coli in a patient with cholangitis). Definitions of active antibiotics against indicated bacteria were taken from the Sanford Guide to Antimicrobial Therapy 2017 (47th edition). Patients were considered to be receiving an active antibiotic at the time of testing if they received at least 1 dose in the 2 days before sample collection. For each patient, definitions were applied by the senior author (M.H.N.) and adjudicated by a committee of investigators (M.H.N., C.J.C., M.P.W., and E.M.). Statistical Analysis The primary outcomes were sensitivity and specificity of the T2Bacteria Panel, which were calculated using positive blood culture results for a T2Bacteria-targeted organism (that is, proven BSI) as the reference. For per-patient calculations, each patient's sample was considered positive or negative on the basis of results for the 5 organisms in the T2Bacteria Panel. For per-assay calculations, results for individual organisms in each sample were considered separately. Test results were classified as concordant (positive result on blood culture and T2Bacteria Panel for the same species or negative result on both) or discordant (positive blood culture and negative T2Bacteria result or vice versa) for organisms detected by T2Bacteria. Negative blood cultures with a positive T2Bacteria result were defined as putative false positives if criteria for proven, probable, or possible BSI were not met. The 95% CIs for sensitivity and specificity were calculated using the exact ClopperPearson method. Analyses were conducted using Stata, version 15 (StataCorp). Role of the Funding Source The study was designed by the investigators in conjunction with the sponsor (T2 Biosystems), with input from the FDA. The sponsor assisted the investigators with protocol development and creation of the case report form. Data were collected by the investigators and curated in the sponsor's FDA-compliant database. The investigators analyzed and interpreted data and generated conclusions without input from the sponsor. The sponsor was not involved in the decision to publish the results. A draft of the manuscript was submitted to the sponsor. The investigators are solely responsible for the content of the article. Results Patient Enrollment and Blood Culture Results Informed consent was obtained from 1502 patients. Five percent (75 of 1502) were excluded because of deficiencies in sample collection (56% [42 of 75]) or tube storage (41% [31 of 75]) or because of previous enrollment (3% [2 of 75]). Samples from 1427 patients were tested in the study. The median patient age was 56 years, 63% (893 of 1427) were white, and 57% (809 of 1427) were men. Companion blood cultures were positive for 85 organisms in 6% (82 of 1427) of patients (Appendix Table 3). Organisms included in the T2Bacteria Panel were identified in 48% (39 of 82) of positive blood cultures, includin",2019,Annals of Internal Medicine
Immune Activation and Loss of Eomes and PLZF Common Variable Immunodeficiency Is Associated with Loss of Circulating Mucosal-Associated Invariant T Cells in,"Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is characterized by low levels of Igs leading to increased risk of infections. Mucosalassociated invariant T (MAIT) cells are a recently identified population of innate T cells with potent antibacterial activity. We hypothesized that CVID is associated with alterations in MAIT cells. Cryopreserved PBMC from CVID patients and healthy controls were used to study the frequency, phenotype, and response to Escherichia coli stimulation of MAIT cells by flow cytometry. MAIT cell frequency and absolute counts were depressed in CVID. Residual MAIT presented elevated coexpression of CD38 and HLA-DR, and reduced expression of CCR6, whereas levels of CD127 (IL-7 receptor) were unchanged. CVID patients also had an accumulation of MAIT cells lacking the critical transcription factors eomesodermin and promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein. MAIT cell frequency was inversely associated with levels of soluble CD14, with coexpression of CD38 and HLA-DR, and accumulation of MAIT cells lacking eomesodermin or promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein expression. None of these changes were normalized by IgG replacement therapy. Finally, MAIT cells from CVID patients displayed poor IFN-g responses to E. coli stimulation, in part due to defective Ag presentation, and these responses were increased by pretreatment with IL-7. Defective MAIT cell response may contribute to the increased incidence of microbial infections seen in CVID patients on IgG replacement therapy. ImmunoHorizons,",2017,
"Statistical methods in disease risk analysis, disease testing and nutrition epidemiology","The thesis is composed of three separated projects: disease risk scoring systems (chapter 2), statistical tests for proportion difference in one-to-two matched binary data (chapter 3) and bivariate measurement error model for nutrition epidemiology (chapter 4). In the first project, we propose to use group lasso algorithm for logistic regression to construct a risk scoring system for predicting disease in swine. We choose the penalty parameter for the group lasso through leave-one-out cross validation and use the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve as criterion. We show our proposed scoring system is superior to existing methods. The second project was originally motivated by the pooling of diagnostic tests. We proposed exact and asymptotic tests for one-to-two matched binary data. Unlike other existing methods, our procedure doesnâ€™t rely on a mutual independence assumption. The emphasis on dependence among observations from the same matched set is natural and appealing, as much in human health as it is in veterinary medicine. It can be applied to many kinds of diagnostic studies with a one-to-two matched data structure. Our method can also be generalized to one-to-N matched case in a straightforward manner. In the third paper we consider the problem of estimating the joint distribution of two correlated random variables where one of the variables is observed with error. DKM is first used to adjust the univariate measurement error. A Gaussian copula is then used to model the correlation structure between the two variables after error adjustment.",2018,

Inference on Large-scale Structures,"The emergence of â€˜Big Dataâ€™ has driven a new statistical branch which Efron [11] calls â€˜Large-Scale Inferenceâ€™ (LSI). In many LSI problems, the data are structured. Due to proximity in geography, time, etc., the data matrix may contain graphical structures, low-rank structures, clustering structures, etc.. These structure pose great challenges as well as great opportunities: by carefully exploiting such structures, we are able to significantly improve the inference. In this dissertation, we illustrate the point by exploiting two types of structures: sparse graphical structures and homogeneous clustering structures. Consider a linear regression model Y = XÎ² + , where X âˆˆ RnÃ—p is the design matrix and is the noise vector. Our study consists of two parts. The first part is largely motivated by the recent interest in DNA copy number variation (CNV) and long-memory financial data, where the focus is â€˜variable selectionâ€™: we assume the effects are â€˜rare and weakâ€™ in the sense that only a small fraction of the entries of Î² are nonzero and the nonzeros are individually small; the main interest is to identify this small fraction of nonzeros. We consider the very challenging case where the columns of the design matrix X are heavily correlated. We recognize that in many of such situations, adjacent rows of the Gram matrix G = X â€²X are similar, and such structures can be exploited for better variable selection. We develop a new variable selection procedure called â€˜Covariate Assisted Screening and Estimation (CASE)â€™. CASE is a two-stage Screen and Clean method, at the heart of which is a graph-guided multivariate screening procedure. We show that in a broad context, CASE achieves the minimax Hamming selection errors. We have successfully applied CASE to a change-point problem and long-memory time series, and derived explicit forms of the so-called â€˜phase diagramsâ€™. The phase diagram is a recent way to visualize variable selection that is especially appropriate for rare and weak effects. iii CASE has advantages over the more well-known L/L-penalization methods and marginal screening. CASE is a flexible idea and is readily extendable to many different settings. The second part of the study is largely motivated by the recent interest on gene network [32] and the study of housing price [16]. We assume the vector Î² is homogeneous in the sense that its entries cluster into a few groups, and entries in each group share a common value; the main interest is to take advantage of such structures to estimate Î². We propose a new method called â€˜Clustering Algorithm in Regression via Datadriven Segmentationâ€™ (CARDS). We show that under mild conditions, CARDS successfully recovers the groups of variables and achieves the oracle estimation errors. The study provides additional insights on how to exploit low-dimensional structures in high-dimensional regression problems. CARDS was successfully applied to predicting Polyadenylation signals and the S&P500 stock returns. Compared to methods not taking advantage of homogeneity, CARDS has much smaller estimation errors. Compared to other methods that attempt to exploit homogeneity such as the fused lasso, CARDS has the advantage of not requiring any given ordering or graph on the variables. CARDS is also a flexible idea and can be adapted to many different settings.",2014,
Seroprevalence of Toxoplasma gondii and direct genotyping using minisequencing in free-range pigs in Burkina Faso.,"BACKGROUND
Swine are a major source of meat for humans. As such, they can play an important role in the epidemiology of human toxoplasmosis. Therefore, we performed an epidemiological study to determine the prevalence and genotypes of Toxoplasma gondii in Burkina Fasan swine.


METHODS
The prevalence of T. gondii infection was evaluated in a 3-month prospective study at the slaughterhouse of Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso. Anti-Toxoplasma IgG titers were determined on meat juices from pig diaphragms using a commercially available ELISA assay. The DNA was extracted from 25mg of heart biopsies of seropositive animals (IgG â‰¥50% of the control) and the presence of T. gondii DNA was detected using a quantitative PCR assay. Genotyping was performed directly on DNA from PCR-positive biopsies using high-resolution melting and minisequencing analyses of the repeated B1 gene.


RESULTS
The prevalence of carcasses positive for anti-Toxoplasma IgG was 29% (87/300) with no difference according to sex and age in contrast to the village of origin (p=0.018). Of the 87 seropositive animals, two were PCR positive (parasitic load at 64 and 128 parasites/mg of heart biopsy). Two new genotypes belonging to Type II and Type III and different from the genotypes previously described using minisequencing were identified.


CONCLUSION
Our study provides the first T. gondii seroprevalence data in Burkina Fasan swine. In addition, this direct typing method suggests diversity of the T. gondii genotypes circulating in domestic animals in Burkina Faso. This needs to be confirmed on a wider sampling of subjects.",2016,International journal of food microbiology
Application of shrinkage estimation in linear regression models with autoregressive errors,"In this paper, we consider the shrinkage and penalty estimation procedures in the linear regression model with autoregressive errors of order p when it is conjectured that some of the regression parameters are inactive. We develop the statistical properties of the shrinkage estimation method including asymptotic distributional biases and risks. We show that the shrinkage estimators have a significantly higher relative efficiency than the classical estimator. Furthermore, we consider the two penalty estimators: least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and adaptive LASSO estimators, and numerically compare their relative performance with that of the shrinkage estimators. A Monte Carlo simulation experiment is conducted for different combinations of inactive predictors and the performance of each estimator is evaluated in terms of the simulated mean-squared error. This study shows that the shrinkage estimators are comparable to the penalty estimators when the number of inactive predictors in the model is relatively large. The shrinkage and penalty methods are applied to a real data set to illustrate the usefulness of the procedures in practice.",2015,Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation

Identification of Fis1 Interactors in Toxoplasma gondii Reveals a Novel Protein Required for Peripheral Distribution of the Mitochondrion,"Toxoplasma gondii's single mitochondrion is very dynamic and undergoes morphological changes throughout the parasite's life cycle. During parasite division, the mitochondrion elongates, enters the daughter cells just prior to cytokinesis, and undergoes fission. Extensive morphological changes also occur as the parasite transitions from the intracellular environment to the extracellular environment. We show that treatment with the ionophore monensin causes reversible constriction of the mitochondrial outer membrane and that this effect depends on the function of the fission-related protein Fis1. We also observed that mislocalization of the endogenous Fis1 causes a dominant-negative effect that affects the morphology of the mitochondrion. As this suggests that Fis1 interacts with proteins critical for maintenance of mitochondrial structure, we performed various protein interaction trap screens. In this manner, we identified a novel outer mitochondrial membrane protein, LMF1, which is essential for positioning of the mitochondrion in intracellular parasites. Normally, while inside a host cell, the parasite mitochondrion is maintained in a lasso shape that stretches around the parasite periphery where it has regions of coupling with the parasite pellicle, suggesting the presence of membrane contact sites. In intracellular parasites lacking LMF1, the mitochondrion is retracted away from the pellicle and instead is collapsed, as normally seen only in extracellular parasites. We show that this phenotype is associated with defects in parasite fitness and mitochondrial segregation. Thus, LMF1 is necessary for mitochondrial association with the parasite pellicle during intracellular growth, and proper mitochondrial morphology is a prerequisite for mitochondrial division.IMPORTANCE Toxoplasma gondii is an opportunistic pathogen that can cause devastating tissue damage in the immunocompromised and congenitally infected. Current therapies are not effective against all life stages of the parasite, and many cause toxic effects. The single mitochondrion of this parasite is a validated drug target, and it changes its shape throughout its life cycle. When the parasite is inside a cell, the mitochondrion adopts a lasso shape that lies in close proximity to the pellicle. The functional significance of this morphology is not understood and the proteins involved are currently not known. We have identified a protein that is required for proper mitochondrial positioning at the periphery and that likely plays a role in tethering this organelle. Loss of this protein results in dramatic changes to the mitochondrial morphology and significant parasite division and propagation defects. Our results give important insight into the molecular mechanisms regulating mitochondrial morphology.",2020,mBio
Model selection consistency of U-statistics with convex loss and weighted lasso penalty,"ABSTRACT In the paper we consider minimisation of U-statistics with the weighted Lasso penalty and investigate their asymptotic properties in model selection and estimation. We prove that the use of appropriate weights in the penalty leads to the procedure that behaves like the oracle that knows the true model in advance, i.e. it is model selection consistent and estimates nonzero parameters with the standard rate. For the unweighted Lasso penalty, we obtain sufficient and necessary conditions for model selection consistency of estimators. The obtained results strongly based on the convexity of the loss function that is the main assumption of the paper. Our theorems can be applied to the ranking problem as well as generalised regression models. Thus, using U-statistics we can study more complex models (better describing real problems) than usually investigated linear or generalised linear models.",2017,Journal of Nonparametric Statistics
Liaison and Rel. Top.,"We discuss the problem of whether arithmetically Gorenstei schemes are in the Gorenstein liaison class of a complete intersecti on. We present some axamples of arithmetically Gorenstein schenes that are ind ed in the Gorenstein liaison class of a complete intersection. In the recent research on Gorenstein liaison theory, the que stion whether any arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay scheme is in the Gorenstein liaison cl ass of a complete intersection, has been of main importance. The intention of this question is to fully generalize Gaeta theorem to arbitrary codimension. Gaeta theorem says that in codime nsion 2 any arithmetically CohenMacaulay scheme is in the complete intersection liaison cla ss of a complete intersection. As it has been shown in the recent papers on liaison theory, it is li kely that in arbitrary codimension Gorenstein liaison behaves better than complete intersect ion liaison. Indeed, some of the theorems of complete intersection liaison in codimension 2, do not hold for complete intersection liaison in arbitrary codimension but hold when we link by mea ns of arithmetically Gorenstein schemes instead of complete intersection schemes. So it is n a ural to ask if any arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay scheme is in the Gorenstein liaison class of a c mplete intersection or briefly glicci. Since complete intersection schemes have been changed to ar ithmetically Gorenstein schemes in the study of liaison theory in arbitrary codimension, t is natural to ask why we formulate the questionâ€œ(1) Is any arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay scheme glicci?â€ nstead of formulating first the weaker question â€œ(2) Is any arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay scheme in the Gor enstein liaison class of an arithmetically Gorenstein scheme?â€ If we use the acronymglicog for the schemes that are in the GorensteinLi aisonClassOf an arithmeticallyGorenstein scheme, then Question (2) asks if any arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay sch eme is glicog. If Question (1) could be answered affirmatively, then Questi on (2) would also have an affirmative answer. Moreover, if it could be proved that any ari thmetically Gorenstein scheme is glicci, then both questions would be equivalent. So one of th e first questions that Gorenstein liaison has to address is â€œ(3) Is any arithmetically Gorenstein scheme glicci?â€ This is still an open question. The purpose of this note is to present some res ults that answer this question affirmatively in some cases. First of all, the main result that gives a partial affirmative answer to Question (3) is that any arithmetically Gorenstein scheme of codimension 3 is licci, i.e. it is in the complete intersection liaison class of a complete intersection (in particular it i s glicci). This result is attributed to Watanabe because it can be derived from the proof of his main t heorem in [4]. It is known that in higher codimension there exist arithmetically Gorenste i schemes that are not licci, but it is not known if they are glicci or not. To study Gorenstein liaison classes of schemes of arbitrary codimension, we have used the results of [3] where there are given useful methods to study G orenstein liaison classes of divisors on arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay schemes. In this setting , we have studied the Gorenstein",2003,
Development and internal validation of the multivariable CIPHER (Collaborative Integrated Pregnancy High-dependency Estimate of Risk) clinical risk prediction model,"BackgroundIntensive care unit (ICU) outcome prediction models, such as Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE), were designed in general critical care populations and their use in obstetric populations is contentious. The aim of the CIPHER (Collaborative Integrated Pregnancy High-dependency Estimate of Risk) study was to develop and internally validate a multivariable prognostic model calibrated specifically for pregnant or recently delivered women admitted for critical care.MethodsA retrospective observational cohort was created for this study from 13 tertiary facilities across five high-income and six low- or middle-income countries. Women admitted to an ICU for more thanâ€‰24Â h during pregnancy orÂ less thanÂ 6Â weeks post-partum from 2000 to 2012 were included in the cohort. A composite primary outcome was defined as maternal death or need for organ support for more than 7Â days or acute life-saving intervention. Model development involved selection of candidate predictor variables based on prior evidence of effect, availability across study sites, and use of LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) model building after multiple imputation using chained equations to address missing data for variable selection. The final model was estimated using multivariable logistic regression. Internal validation was completed using bootstrapping to correct for optimism in model performance measures of discrimination and calibration.ResultsOverall, 127 out of 769 (16.5%) women experienced an adverse outcome. Predictors included in the final CIPHER model were maternal age, surgery in the preceding 24Â h, systolic blood pressure, Glasgow Coma Scale score, serum sodium, serum potassium, activated partial thromboplastin time, arterial blood gas (ABG) pH, serum creatinine, and serum bilirubin. After internal validation, the model maintained excellent discrimination (area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 0.84) and good calibration (slope of 0.92, 95% CI 0.91 to 0.92 and intercept of âˆ’0.11, 95% CI âˆ’0.13 to âˆ’0.08).ConclusionsThe CIPHER model has the potential to be a pragmatic risk prediction tool. CIPHER can identify critically ill pregnant women at highest risk for adverse outcomes, inform counseling of patients about risk, and facilitate bench-marking of outcomes between centers by adjusting for baseline risk.",2018,Critical Care
Accelerating Deep Learning with Shrinkage and Recall,"Deep Learning is a very powerful machine learning model. Deep Learning trains a large number of parameters for multiple layers and is very slow when data is in large scale and the architecture size is large. Inspired from the shrinking technique used in accelerating computation of Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithm and screening technique used in LASSO, we propose a shrinking Deep Learning with recall (sDLr) approach to speed up deep learning computation. We experiment shrinking Deep Learning with recall (sDLr) using Deep Neural Network (DNN), Deep Belief Network (DBN) and Convolution Neural Network (CNN) on 4 data sets. Results show that the speedup using shrinking Deep Learning with recall (sDLr) can reach more than 2.0 while still giving competitive classification performance.",2016,2016 IEEE 22nd International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems (ICPADS)

Improving Lasso for model selection and prediction,"It is known that the Thresholded Lasso (TL), SCAD or MCP correct intrinsic estimation bias of the Lasso. In this paper we propose an alternative method of improving the Lasso for predictive models with general convex loss functions which encompass normal linear models, logistic regression, quantile regression or support vector machines. For a given penalty we order the absolute values of the Lasso non-zero coefficients and then select the final model from a small nested family by the Generalized Information Criterion. We derive exponential upper bounds on the selection error of the method. These results confirm that, at least for normal linear models, our algorithm seems to be the benchmark for the theory of model selection as it is constructive, computationally efficient and leads to consistent model selection under weak assumptions. Constructivity of the algorithm means that, in contrast to the TL, SCAD or MCP, consistent selection does not rely on the unknown parameters as the cone invertibility factor. Instead, our algorithm only needs the sample size, the number of predictors and an upper bound on the noise parameter. We show in numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world data sets that an implementation of our algorithm is more accurate than implementations of studied concave regularizations. Our procedure is contained in the R package ""DMRnet"" and available on the CRAN repository.",2019,arXiv: Statistics Theory

Introducing a series of topical special issues of the Journal of Muscle Research and Cell Motility,"The Journal of Muscle Research aims to serve its readers not only by publishing original studies in muscle and motility structure and function but also by informing readers of the state of the art in muscle research and cell motility and to promote debate. This issue of the Journal of Muscle Research and Cell Motility is the first of a series of topical special issues that combine original research with review articles related to a specific subject that we plan to publish once or twice a year. Further topical issues are being planned and we would welcome ideas for the themes to be covered in future issues. In this issue, articles are devoted to cardiac myosinbinding protein-C. When C-protein, or myosin-binding protein-C (MyBP-C) was discovered in skeletal muscle in the early 1970s by Gerald Offer (Offer 1972; Offer et al. 1973), MyBP-C was thought to be merely a structural protein component of the thick filament. Interest in the functions of MyBP-C were galvanised when it was found that the cardiac isoform, encoded by the MYBPC3 gene on chromosome 11, was mutated in cases of hereditary hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) (Bonne et al. 1995; Watkins et al. 1995). By now, mutations in MYBPC3 are the second-most frequently identified mutations that cause HCM (Schlossarek et al. 2011), with carriers of a specific pathogenic mutation amounting up to 4 % of the population of Indian descent (Dhandapany et al. 2009). It has become clear that MyBP-C must play important roles in both the regulation of contractility and as the assembly of muscle myofibrils. MyBP-C is transcribed from three related genes (MYBPC1-3), which encode the slow, fast and cardiac isoforms. Like many other myofibrilassociated structural proteins, MyBP-C is composed of a series of hundred-residue domains of the intracellular immunoglobulin and fibronectin familiesâ€”10â€“11 in the case of MyBP-C (Furst and Gautel 1995; Otey et al. 2009). This molecular architecture is shared with the small MyBPC homologue, myosin-binding protein-H (Vaughan et al. 1993) and other myofibrillar proteins like myopalladin, myotilin, the myomesin isogenes and the giant scaffold and signalling proteins titin and obscurin (KontrogianniKonstantopoulos et al. 2009). Earlier work by the laboratories of Gerald Offer, Carl Moos, Roger Starr, Rick Moss, Polly Hofmann, Criss Hartzell and others had implicated MyBP-C in contraction regulation by interactions with actin or myosin filament components, possibly dynamically modulated by phosphorylation by cAMP and calcium/calmodulin dependent protein kinases in the case of the cardiac isoform (see articles in this issue for a review of the literature). The elucidation of the primary structure of both skeletal and cardiac MyBP-C isoforms pinpointed these phosphorylation sites to the N-terminal region within a sequence distinct from the immunoglobulin or fibronectin-like domains that form the remainder of the protein (Einheber and Fischman 1990; Furst et al. 1992; Gautel et al. 1995). This MyBP-C motif has since been implicated as the major domain involved in contraction regulation by interactions that have been localised to both the actin and myosin S. B.

Disparate Efficacy of Collagen Hydrolysate and Glucosamine on the Extracellular Matrix Metabolism of Articular Chondrocytes,"Purpose: Glucosamine has been used in the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) for several years. More recently, collagen fragments were shown to provide a positive effect on joint health. The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy of a specific type of collagen hydrolysate (CH) on the biosynthesis of ECM macromolecules in comparison with glucosamine sulfate (GS) and glucosamine hydrochloride (GH) in a chondrocyte culture model. Methods: Primary porcine articular chondrocytes and human femoral head chondrocytes were cultured under reduced oxygen conditions. The culture medium was supplemented with various concentrations of CH. In parallel experiments chondrocytes were treated with either GS or GH in various concentrations up to 2.5mM. At the end of the culture period the amount of cellassociated proteoglycans (PGs) and the extent of PG synthesis were quantified by measuring 35S-sulfate incorporation and by colorimetric assay. The amount of aggrecan accumulated in the ECM was determined by Western Blotting. In addition, type II collagen biosynthesis was quantified by means of ELISA technique. The results were confirmed by immunocytochemical detection of type II collagen and by analyzing the incorporation of 14C-proline into matrix proteins. Results: Supplementation of the culture medium with CH resulted in a statistically significant (p<0.05) increase of PG synthesis. The amount of cell-associated PGs was almost doubled after CH treatment, compared with the control cells. Administration of CH was also associated with increased aggrecan expression and a statistically significant (p<0.05) 1.5-fold increase of type II collagen biosynthesis. In contrast, the administration of GS or GH had no stimulatory effect on the type II collagen biosynthesis of the chondrocytes. Moreover, although slight differences could be observed between GS and GH, supplementation of glucosamine had no significant effect on the amount of cell-associated PGs, or total PG synthesis, compared to the controls. Conclusions: These results indicate a stimulatory effect of CH on the synthesis of PG and type II collagen. In contrast, GS and GH failed to stimulate the synthesis extracellular matrix (ECM) macromolecules by chondrocytes. These data suggest that CH may help reduce degenerative changes of the ECM by stimulating anabolic processes in cartilage tissue.",2007,
OC-097 An externally validated nomogram to predict the risk of bowel dysfunction following an anterior resection,"Introduction Almost half of the patients undergoing an anterior resection for rectal cancer report quality of life impairment due to bowel dysfunction. The Low Anterior Resection Syndrome (LARS) score is an internationally validated patient reported outcome measure (PROM) designed to assess the severity of these symptoms. 1 The aims of this study were to (i) produce a LARS score prediction model based on the risk factors for bowel dysfunction (ii) to validate the model externally and (iii) to incorporate findings into a nomogram for use in clinical practice. Method Patients who were recurrence free and more than one-year post restorative anterior resection (UK, 2001â€“2011; Denmark, 2001â€“2007 (median 54 and 56 months since surgery respectively), were invited to complete EORTC QLQ-C30, LARS and Wexner incontinence scores. Demographics, tumour characteristics, pre/post-operative treatment, and surgical procedures were recorded. Advanced linear regression shrinkage techniques (i.e. LASSO) were used independently for both datasets (UK, DK) for an unbiased selection of the most influential factors. Finally a nomogram based on linear regression was generated. Results The model was developed from 463 British patients and validated in 938 Danes. The respective cohorts were similar in gender (females 40% [184/463] versus 43% [402/938] NS) but differed by age (65 [13] versus 64 [13], p = 0.013), pre-operative radiotherapy (31.6% [145/463] versus 20.4% [191/938], p = 0.001), tumour height (median [IQR] 9 cm [4] versus 11 [4], p = 0.001), global quality of life (mean (SD) QLQ C30 Scale, 77 (19) versus 78 (21), p = 0.001) and LARS score (mean (SD) 26.1 (11) versus 24.5 (12), p = 0.012). Tumour height (from the anal verge) and pre-operative radiotherapy were the key variables in the nomogram with several additional factors including age, gender and temporary stoma influencing the predicted LARS score. Conclusion This is the first nomogram to predict patient reported bowel dysfunction following an anterior resection. Despite differences between cohorts, with the UK tending to restore lower tumours and use more pre-operative radiotherapy, we were able to externally validate the model in a Danish population. Colorectal Surgeons and Nurse Specialists may use this predictive tool to help patients understand their risk of bowel dysfunction, it is intended to aid the consent process and highlight patients that may need additional post-operative support.

Sequence homolog-based molecular engineering for shifting the enzymatic pH optimum,"Cell-free synthetic biology system organizes multiple enzymes (parts) from different sources to implement unnatural catalytic functions. Highly adaption between the catalytic parts is crucial for building up efficient artificial biosynthetic systems. Protein engineering is a powerful technology to tailor various enzymatic properties including catalytic efficiency, substrate specificity, temperature adaptation and even achieve new catalytic functions. However, altering enzymatic pH optimum still remains a challenging task. In this study, we proposed a novel sequence homolog-based protein engineering strategy for shifting the enzymatic pH optimum based on statistical analyses of sequence-function relationship data of enzyme family. By two statistical procedures, artificial neural networks (ANNs) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso), five amino acids in GH11 xylanase family were identified to be related to the evolution of enzymatic pH optimum. Site-directed mutagenesis of a thermophilic xylanase from Caldicellulosiruptor bescii revealed that four out of five mutations could alter the enzymatic pH optima toward acidic condition without compromising the catalytic activity and thermostability. Combination of the positive mutants resulted in the best mutant M31 that decreased its pH optimum for 1.5 units and showed increased catalytic activity at pHÂ <Â 5.0 compared to the wild-type enzyme. Structure analysis revealed that all the mutations are distant from the active center, which may be difficult to be identified by conventional rational design strategy. Interestingly, the four mutation sites are clustered at a certain region of the enzyme, suggesting a potential ""hot zone"" for regulating the pH optima of xylanases. This study provides an efficient method of modulating enzymatic pH optima based on statistical sequence analyses, which can facilitate the design and optimization of suitable catalytic parts for the construction of complicated cell-free synthetic biology systems.",2016,Synthetic and Systems Biotechnology
Sensitivity of ` 1 minimization to parameter choice,"The use of generalized LASSO is a common technique for recovery of structured high-dimensional signals. Each generalized LASSO program has a governing parameter whose optimal value depends on properties of the data. At this optimal value, compressed sensing theory explains why LASSO programs recover structured high-dimensional signals with minimax order-optimal error. Unfortunately in practice, the optimal choice is generally unknown and must be estimated. Thus, we investigate stability of each LASSO program with respect to its governing parameter. Our goal is to aid the practitioner in answering the following question: given real data, which LASSO program should be used? We take a step towards answering this by analyzing the case where the measurement matrix is identity (the so-called proximal denoising setup) and we use `1 regularization. For each LASSO program, we specify settings in which that program is provably unstable with respect to its governing parameter. We support our analysis with detailed numerical simulations. For example, there are settings where a 0.1% underestimate of a LASSO parameter can increase the error significantly; and a 50% underestimate can cause the error to increase by a factor of 109.",2019,

Optimization of turn-back primers in isothermal amplification,"The application of isothermal amplification technologies is rapidly expanding and currently covers different areas such as pathogen detection and SNP genotyping. Meanwhile, many of such technologies have complex reaction processes and often require a fine-tuned primer set where existing primer design tools are not sufficient. We have developed a primer selection system for one important primer, the turn-back primer (TP), which is commonly used in loop-mediated amplification (LAMP) and smart amplification process (SmartAmp). We chose 78 parameters related to the primer and target sequence, and explored their relationship to amplification speed using experimental data for 1344 primer combinations. We employed the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method for parameter selection and estimation of their numerical coefficients. The evaluation showed that our approach yields a superior primer design in isothermal amplification and is robust against variations in the experimental setup.

Direct and indirect effects of invasive lionfish on coral-reef cleaning mutualists,"Cleaning mutualisms are ubiquitous interactions on coral reefs involving cleaner fishes and shrimps that remove external parasites from cooperative fish clients. Despite their ecological importance, nothing is known regarding how cleaning mutualisms are affected by the invasion of Atlantic coral reefs by the Pacific red lionfish Pterois volitans. Lionfish are generalist predators that may consume both cleaners and clients, with potential cascading effects on native communities. To determine whether invasive lionfish affect cleaning mutualists, I conducted a before-after-control-impact experiment manipulating the presence of lionfish on patch reefs in the Bahamas. The addition of lionfish to reefs did not significantly affect the survival and growth rates of the predominant obligate cleaner on experimental reefs, the cleaner goby Elacatinus genie. However, lionfish affected juvenile bluehead wrasse Thalassoma bifasciatum, a facultative cleaner whose density was 33% less on reefs with lionfish versus those without. The decline of bluehead wrasse was most likely due to predation by lionfish. Also, the presence of lionfish affected large transient clients, i.e. species that move among reefs; their density was 78% less on reefs with lionfish versus those without. The decline of transient species may be an indirect effect of lionfish consuming non-goby cleaners and prey, fishes that would otherwise cue transient species to aggregate at reefs. The cleaner goby is among the few small fishes on invaded reefs to escape predation by lionfish. However, by consuming other cleaners, invasive lionfish may nonetheless alter native reef communities and ecosystems.",2017,Marine Ecology Progress Series

"Palynological assemblage from the lower Cenomanian plant-bearing LagerstÃ¤tte of Jaunay-Clan-Ormeau-Saint-Denis (Vienne, western France): Stratigraphic and paleoenvironmental implications","Abstract We describe here the palynological content from the lower Cenomanian plant-rich site of Jaunay-Clan (Vienne, western France), a site that previously yielded exceptional leaf impressions. Altogether, 184 species of palynomorphs have been identified, and two palynological intervals were recognized in the sedimentary sequence. The lower interval is characterized by the taxonomical and numerical dominance of spores of Gleicheniaceae, Cyatheales, and Anemiaceae, while the upper interval is characterized by an abrupt increase in the abundance of Classopollis and the appearance of dinocysts. This shift in the palynological composition, coupled with paleobotanical observations, is interpreted as reflecting a transition from a calm freshwater environment, with occasional droughts to an environment more open to very occasional marine inputs, such as an inner lagoon. The association of Tehamadinium coummia, Trichodinium spinosum, Tricolpites nemejcii, Retitricolporites decorosus, and Microreticulatiporites sacalii, coupled with the absence of Normapolles pollen grains, suggests that the Jaunay-Clan assemblage is early Cenomanian in age, corroborating the previous determination based on lithological and paleontological proxies. However, the Jaunay-Clan palynoflora is considered to be slightly younger than the numerous earliest Cenomanian assemblages described from Charente-Maritime, owing to its resemblance with mid-lower Cenomanian palynofloras from western France. The paleoflora and palynoflora from Jaunay-Clan are similar to other assemblages found in the upper Albian of Spain (Teruel Province), and in the Cenomanian of France and Czech Republic (Peruc-Korycany Formation, La Buzinie, Archingeay). The combined Jaunay-Clan palynoflora and paleoflora is considered to be the most diversified Cenomanian paleobotanical-palynological assemblage described so far in Western Europe.",2019,Review of Palaeobotany and Palynology
The Effect of Arterial Stiffness on Recurrence of Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation after Catheter Ablation,"Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between arterial stiffness and atrial fibrillation (AF) recurrence after catheter ablation (CA). Methods: We enrolled 94 consecutive patients (mean age: 62Â±9.5) undergoing circumferential pulmonary vein electrical isolation with a double lasso technique using CARTO system for paroxysmal AF. Cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) was determined as an index of arterial stiffness. Plasma BNP, serum aldosterone, and high sensitivity CRP were assayed, and Left atrial volume (LAV) was measured by multi-slice CT. Results: Among the 94 patients, 26 (28%) had metabolic syndrome. In simple regression analysis, CAVI were correlated with age, eGFR, BNP, and LAV (p<0.001, p<0.05, p<0.01, p<0.05, respectively). During a follow-up of 7.9Â±2.3 months, 21 patients experienced AF recurrence. Patients with AF recurrence had a increased CAVI (recurrence 8.9 vs non-recurrence 8.2 p<0.05) and a larger LAV (recurrence 81.3 ml vs non-recurrence 70.6 ml p<0.05) compared with patients without AF recurrence. Multivariate analysis revealed that LAV, BNP, CAVI were independently associated with AF recurrence (t-value: 2.76, 4.65, 2.28, respectively). Conclusions: CAVI was associated with age, BNP and LAV, suggesting a significant role of arterial stiffness in AF after CA.",2011,Journal of Arrhythmia
Homology-based radiomic features for prediction of the prognosis of lung cancer based on CT-based radiomics.,"PURPOSE
Radiomics is a new technique that enables noninvasive prognostic prediction by extracting features from medical images. Homology is a concept used in many branches of algebra and topology that can quantify the contact degree. In the present study, we developed homology-based radiomic features to predict the prognosis of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients and then evaluated the accuracy of this prediction method.


METHODS
Four data sets were used: two to provide training and test data and two for the selection of robust radiomic features. All the data sets were downloaded from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). In two-dimensional cases, the Betti numbers consist of two values: b0 (zero-dimensional Betti number), which is the number of isolated components, and b1 (one-dimensional Betti number), which is the number of one-dimensional or ""circular"" holes. For homology-based evaluation, CT images must be converted to binarized images in which each pixel has two possible values: 0 or 1. All CT slices of the gross tumor volume were used for calculating the homology histogram. First, by changing the threshold of the CT value (range: -150 to 300 HU) for all its slices, we developed homology-based histograms for b0 , b1 , and b1 /b0 using binarized images All histograms were then summed, and the summed histogram was normalized by the number of slices. 144 homology-based radiomic features were defined from the histogram. To compare the standard radiomic features, 107 radiomic features were calculated using the standard radiomics technique. To clarify the prognostic power, the relationship between the values of the homology-based radiomic features and overall survival was evaluated using LASSO Cox regression model and the Kaplan-Meier method. The retained features with non-zero coefficients calculated by the LASSO Cox regression model were used for fitting the regression model. Moreover, these features were then integrated into a radiomics signature. An individualized rad score was calculated from a linear combination of the selected features, which were weighted by their respective coefficients.


RESULTS
When the patients in the training and test data sets were stratified into high-risk and low-risk groups according to the rad scores, the overall survival of the groups was significantly different. The C-index values for the homology-based features (rad score), standard features (rad score), and tumor size were 0.625, 0.603, and 0.607, respectively, for the training data sets and 0.689, 0.668, and 0.667 for the test data sets. This result showed that homology-based radiomic features had slightly higher prediction power than the standard radiomic features.


CONCLUSIONS
Prediction performance using homology-based radiomic features had a comparable or slightly higher prediction power than standard radiomic features. These findings suggest that homology-based radiomic features may have great potential for improving the prognostic prediction accuracy of CT-based radiomics. In this result, it is noteworthy that there are some limitations.",2020,Medical physics
Reconstructing direct and indirect interactions in networked public goods game,"Network reconstruction is a fundamental problem for understanding many complex systems with unknown interaction structures. In many complex systems, there are indirect interactions between two individuals without immediate connection but with common neighbors. Despite recent advances in network reconstruction, we continue to lack an approach for reconstructing complex networks with indirect interactions. Here we introduce a two-step strategy to resolve the reconstruction problem, where in the first step, we recover both direct and indirect interactions by employing the Lasso to solve a sparse signal reconstruction problem, and in the second step, we use matrix transformation and optimization to distinguish between direct and indirect interactions. The network structure corresponding to direct interactions can be fully uncovered. We exploit the public goods game occurring on complex networks as a paradigm for characterizing indirect interactions and test our reconstruction approach. We find that high reconstruction accuracy can be achieved for both homogeneous and heterogeneous networks, and a number of empirical networks in spite of insufficient data measurement contaminated by noise. Although a general framework for reconstructing complex networks with arbitrary types of indirect interactions is yet lacking, our approach opens new routes to separate direct and indirect interactions in a representative complex system.",2016,Scientific Reports

Les alpha#+-thalassemies deletionnelles ont un effet protecteur sur la presentation des maladies dues a un defaut du gene beta-globine. Elles resultent de crossing over ingegaux entre des blocs de sequences homologues repetees. Nous avons mis au point une technique originale d'analyse de ces anomalies par pcr et determine leur frequence chez 121 patients drepanocytaires et/ou -thalassemiques. Chez un malade thalasso-drepanocytaire, nous identifions une mutation beta-thalassemique nouvelle et inhabituelle car de type deletion-insertion, et proposons un modele impliquant des sequences repetees dans son mecanisme d'apparition. Enfin, nous identifions un nouveau polymorphisme de type trinucleotide repete dans une region fonctionnellement importante du locus beta-globine: le site 3'hs1.

"When Elephants Fight, It Is the Grass That Suffers","In his essay summarizing his experiences in learning firsthand about Malawi, Dr. Glasson has identified problems and issues that could be almost every/any country in Africa today that shares a colonial past. His emergent emotions and sensitivity to the people and their situations in the context of eco-injustices have allowed him not only to see Africa through a new lens, but also to connect with the people through third space dialogue. That is, the learning space of two differing cultures or individuals is extended by allowing dialogue and reflection to take place beyond the physical time and space constraints limited by each oneâ€™s own cultural beliefs and knowledge. The issues, challenges, and solutions to Africaâ€™s persistent problems have historically been viewed though a variety of lenses, often from a top-down distant perspective beginning long ago with the illogical partitioning of people and kinships, total insensitivity to the indigenous cultures including languages, and disregard of traditional access to shared resources that had no boundaries or ownership. Colonization also came with different motives and guises: religious, economic, social, political, agricultural, and educational. Jomo Kenyatta (1965), musing over postcolonial rule and its legacy as Kenyaâ€™s first president, stated that he had not realized as he signed a declaration of nationhood, that the British intent was limited to political independence, but continued economic and social dependence had been established and was to be perpetuated.",2010,
A comparative study of variable selection methods in the context of developing psychiatric screening instruments.,"The development of screening instruments for psychiatric disorders involves item selection from a pool of items in existing questionnaires assessing clinical and behavioral phenotypes. A screening instrument should consist of only a few items and have good accuracy in classifying cases and non-cases. Variable/item selection methods such as Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Elastic Net, Classification and Regression Tree, Random Forest, and the two-sample t-test can be used in such context. Unlike situations where variable selection methods are most commonly applied (e.g., ultra high-dimensional genetic or imaging data), psychiatric data usually have lower dimensions and are characterized by the following factors: correlations and possible interactions among predictors, unobservability of important variables (i.e., true variables not measured by available questionnaires), amount and pattern of missing values in the predictors, and prevalence of cases in the training data. We investigate how these factors affect the performance of several variable selection methods and compare them with respect to selection performance and prediction error rate via simulations. Our results demonstrated that: (1) for complete data, LASSO and Elastic Net outperformed other methods with respect to variable selection and future data prediction, and (2) for certain types of incomplete data, Random Forest induced bias in imputation, leading to incorrect ranking of variable importance. We propose the Imputed-LASSO combining Random Forest imputation and LASSO; this approach offsets the bias in Random Forest and offers a simple yet efficient item selection approach for missing data. As an illustration, we apply the methods to items from the standard Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised version.",2014,Statistics in medicine
The distribution of seabirds and pinnipeds in Marguerite Bay and their relationship to physical features during austral winter 2001,"Abstract The distribution of seabirds and pinnipeds and their relationship to physical oceanographic variables were investigated as part of the US Southern Ocean Global Ocean Ecosystem Dynamics field program along a study grid centered around Marguerite Bay on the west Antarctic Peninsula during late fall (Aprilâ€“May) and winter (Julyâ€“August), 2001. Sea-ice conditions during the cruises provided an opportunity to compare the relationship among physical oceanographic variables and species distributions before and after the development of pack ice. During the fall cruise before pack ice development, both sea-ice-affiliated species and open-water-affiliated were observed in the area. The most common ice-affiliated species observed at this time were snow petrel ( Pagodroma nivea , 0.7 individualsÂ km âˆ’2 ) and Antarctic petrel ( Thalassoica antarctica , 0.2 individualsÂ km âˆ’2 ) and the most common open-water-affiliated species were blue petrel ( Halobaena caerulea , 0.4 individualsÂ km âˆ’2 ), cape petrel ( Daption capense , 0.2 individualsÂ km âˆ’2 ), and southern fulmar ( Fulmarus glacialoides , 0.1 individualsÂ km âˆ’2 ). In addition, Antarctic fur seals ( Arctocephalus gazella , 0.1 individualsÂ km âˆ’2 ) and crabeater seals ( Lobodon carcinophagus , 0.4 individualsÂ km âˆ’2 ) were observed in low numbers. Akaike's information criterion was used to assess competing models that predicted predator distributions based on physical oceanographic variables proposed to structure predator distribution in previous research. These analyses indicated that predator distributions were primarily associated with water-mass structure and variability in bottom depth during the fall cruise. Crabeater seal, snow petrel, Antarctic petrel, and southern fulmar had higher densities in Inner Shelf Water, particularly near Alexander Island where a coastal current was present. Blue petrel, kelp gull ( Larus dominicanus ), and southern giant petrel ( Macronectes giganteus ) were positively associated with variability in bottom depth in Aprilâ€“May, suggesting that hydrographic processes influenced by bathymetry may have been important in structuring bird distributions. After the development of pack ice, during July and August, only sea-ice-affiliated species, including snow petrel (1.0 individualsÂ km âˆ’2 ), Antarctic petrel (0.1 individualsÂ km âˆ’2 ), Adelie penguin ( Pygoscelis adeliae , 0.4 individualsÂ km âˆ’2 ), and crabeater seal (0.3 individualsÂ km âˆ’2 ), were observed. Seabirds were primarily associated with sea-ice characteristics (e.g. sea-ice concentration, sea-ice type) rather than the water-column environment later in the winter. Results from this study suggest that the timing and extent of sea-ice development in the fall may influence over-winter predation by seabirds and pinnipeds on zooplankton and fish on the western Antarctic Peninsula. Delays in sea-ice development may allow seabirds and pinnipeds access to biologically important areas such as the Inner Shelf Water for a longer period of time thereby increasing predation on zooplankton and fish.",2004,Deep-sea Research Part Ii-topical Studies in Oceanography
Sparse Estimation of Conditional Graphical Models With Application to Gene Networks.,"In many applications the graph structure in a network arises from two sources: intrinsic connections and connections due to external effects. We introduce a sparse estimation procedure for graphical models that is capable of isolating the intrinsic connections by removing the external effects. Technically, this is formulated as a conditional graphical model, in which the external effects are modeled as predictors, and the graph is determined by the conditional precision matrix. We introduce two sparse estimators of this matrix using the reproduced kernel Hilbert space combined with lasso and adaptive lasso. We establish the sparsity, variable selection consistency, oracle property, and the asymptotic distributions of the proposed estimators. We also develop their convergence rate when the dimension of the conditional precision matrix goes to infinity. The methods are compared with sparse estimators for unconditional graphical models, and with the constrained maximum likelihood estimate that assumes a known graph structure. The methods are applied to a genetic data set to construct a gene network conditioning on single-nucleotide polymorphisms.",2012,Journal of the American Statistical Association
Comparison of Laplace and Double Pareto Penalty: LASSO and Elastic Net,"Lasso (Tibshirani, 1996) and Elastic Net (Zou and Hastie, 2005) have been widely used in various fields for simultaneous variable selection and coefficient estimation. Bayesian methods using a conditional Laplace and a double Pareto prior specification have been discussed in the form of hierarchical specification. Full conditional posterior distributions with each priors have been derived. We compare the performance of Bayesian lassos with Laplace prior and the performance with double Pareto prior using simulations. We also apply the proposed Bayesian hierarchical models to real data sets to predict the collapse of governments in Asia.",2014,
High-Dimensional Metrics in R,"The package High-dimensional Metrics (\Rpackage{hdm}) is an evolving collection of statistical methods for estimation and quantification of uncertainty in high-dimensional approximately sparse models. It focuses on providing confidence intervals and significance testing for (possibly many) low-dimensional subcomponents of the high-dimensional parameter vector. Efficient estimators and uniformly valid confidence intervals for regression coefficients on target variables (e.g., treatment or policy variable) in a high-dimensional approximately sparse regression model, for average treatment effect (ATE) and average treatment effect for the treated (ATET), as well for extensions of these parameters to the endogenous setting are provided. Theory grounded, data-driven methods for selecting the penalization parameter in Lasso regressions under heteroscedastic and non-Gaussian errors are implemented. Moreover, joint/ simultaneous confidence intervals for regression coefficients of a high-dimensional sparse regression are implemented, including a joint significance test for Lasso regression. Data sets which have been used in the literature and might be useful for classroom demonstration and for testing new estimators are included. \R and the package \Rpackage{hdm} are open-source software projects and can be freely downloaded from CRAN: \texttt{http://cran.r-project.org}.",2016,arXiv: Machine Learning

This article argues that this account of primary qualities can help us explain how two major works on media and mediation by the artist Xu Bing, A Book from the Sky and Background Story, are built upon the simulation of such qualities. A Book from the Sky explicitly impoverishes meaning by regressing from actual usage to a pre-world of primitive signifying elements. Background Story extends expression by projecting light across incompatible media, simulating partial communication between a world and its preceding and succeeding worlds across transformative, possibly impoverishing ï¼‚advents.ï¼‚ Such concerns hark back to Xu's early print works which gesture toward the necessity of the advent of the new by underscoring the negotiation between fluidity and fixity, binding the volatility of such negotiation to the felt need for expression to express itself. Such art confirms that ancestrality supports transmission between worlds by leaving footprints of possible advents on the existing world, offering inspiration for its inhabitants who are otherwise unable to penetrate the walls of the intra-world. Thus, while ancestrality impoverishes meaning, it also activates hopes for becoming and enrichment, enabling us to imagine new ways to await the advent of the new.",2016,
An ultrastructural overview of tubificid spermatozoa,"The spermatozoa of seven species of tubificid oligochaete were compared to those already described in order to supply spermatozoal characters for systematic work on Tubificidae. The spermatozoa of Clitellio arenarius (subfamily Tubificinae) resemble those of the two other known members of the subfamily (Tubifex tubifex and Tubificoides amplivasatus) in being of two different types and in showing the same morphology of acrosomes and nuclei. Among Phallodrilinae, the three gutless species Inanidrilus bulbosus, Inanidrilus leukodermatus and Olavius planus share with Bathydrilus formosus the shape of the nucleus and various characters of the acrosome, whereas Thalassodrilus prostatus is particular in having the acrosome vesicle external to the tube and the longest middle piece recorded in oligochaetes. Monopylephorus limosus and Rhizodrilus russus (Rhyacodrilinae) differ widely in acrosomal and nuclear characters: M. limosus has a twisted nucleus, whereas R. russus has an apically flanged nucleus with a conspicuous apical concavity and an endonuclear canal.

Prognostic alternative mRNA splicing signature in hepatocellular carcinoma: a study based on large-scale sequencing data.,"Most genes are alternatively spliced and increasing number of evidences show that alternative splicing (AS) is modified and related to tumor progression. Systematic profiles of AS signature in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is absent and urgently needed. Here, differentially spliced AS transcripts between HCC and non-HCC tissues were compared, prognosis-associated AS events by using univariate Cox regression analysis were selected. Our gene functional enrichment analysis demonstrated the potential pathways enriched by survival-associated AS. Prognostic AS signatures were then constructed for HCC prognosis prediction by Lasso regression model. We also analyzed splicing factors (SFs) regulating underlying mechanisms by Pearson correlation and then built corresponding regulatory networks. In addition, we explored the performance of AS signature in the mutated HCC samples. Genome-wide AS events in 377 HCC patients from TCGA were profiled. Among 34 163 AS events in 8985 genes, 3950 AS events in 2403 genes associated with overall survival (OS) significantly for HCC were detected. In addition, computational algorithm results showed that metabolic and ribosome pathways may be the potential molecular mechanisms regulating the poor prognosis. More importantly, survival-associated AS signatures revealed high performance in predicting HCC prognosis. The area under curve for AS signature was 0.806 in all HCC and 0.944 in TP53 mutated HCC samples at 2000 days of OS. We submitted prognostic SFs to build the AS regulatory network, from which we found prognostic AS events were significantly enriched in metabolism-related pathways. A robust AS signature for HCC patients and revealed the regulatory splicing networks contributing to the potential significantly enriched metabolism-related pathways.",2019,Carcinogenesis
Selection consistency of Lasso-based procedures for misspecified high-dimensional binary model and random regressors,We consider selection of random predictors for high-dimensional regression problem with binary response for a general loss function. Important special case is when the binary model is semiparametric and the response function is misspecified under parametric model fit. Selection for such a scenario aims at recovering the support of the minimizer of the associated risk with large probability. We propose a two-step selection procedure which consists of screening and ordering predictors by Lasso method and then selecting a subset of predictors which minimizes Generalized Information Criterion on the corresponding nested family of models. We prove consistency of the selection method under conditions which allow for much larger number of predictors than number of observations. For the semiparametric case when distribution of random predictors satisfies linear regression conditions the true and the estimated parameters are collinear and their common support can be consistently identified.,2020,ArXiv
A Method for the Design of Gamified Trainings,"The use of game elements in non-game contexts (gamification) -has previously been widely explored in contexts such as healthcare and marketing but less extensively in education and training. In this paper we explore the use of gamification in education and training. Traditional training methods often fail to engage or motivate students, especially Digital Natives raised from a young age with apps and games. This paper explores how classor computer-based trainings can be (re)designed using gamification to increase student engagement and motivation. The paper first develops a taxonomy of game elements, based on a literature review. It then provides an Educational Game Element Database (EGEDB) that includes the taxonomy and that represents the effect of each game element on learning. Following a Design Science Research approach, the paper proposes a method for the design of â€˜â€™gamifiedâ€™â€™ training. The method extends the instructional design model ADDIE (Analyze, Design, Develop, Implement, Evaluate) and uses the EGEDB to select game elements. We evaluate the method using a case study of gamified training design for a customer service contact team at Dutch Railways. The resulting gamified training design is evaluated by trainers from the same company.",2015,
