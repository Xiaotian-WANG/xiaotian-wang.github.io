Sparse Poisson Regression with Penalized Weighted Score Function,"We proposed a new penalized method in this paper to solve sparse Poisson Regression problems. Being different from $\ell_1$ penalized log-likelihood estimation, our new method can be viewed as penalized weighted score function method. We show that under mild conditions, our estimator is $\ell_1$ consistent and the tuning parameter can be pre-specified, which shares the same good property of the square-root Lasso.",2017,arXiv: Statistics Theory
"Una Microflora Del Triasico Superior De La Cuenca De Malargue, Localidad Llantenes, Provincia De Mendoza, Argentina","AN UPPER TRIASSIC MICROFLORA FROM THE MALARGUE BASIN, LLANTENES LOCALITY, MENDOZA PROVINCE, ARGENTINA. In the lower part of the continental Chihuido Formation, Malargue Basin, Llantenes locality, a microflora was found with prevailing non-striate bisaccate pollen grains (Alisporites, Podocarpidite, Falcisporites) and fresh water microplankton. Taxa characteristic for the Triassic, like Guthoerlisporites cancellosus, striate bisaccate pollen and Polypodiisporites ipsviciensis are associated with the first representatives of the genus Classopollis, a genus which in Argentina becomes frequent in the Early Jurassic. Other characteristic genera of the Llantenes microflora are Leptolepidites, Gemmatriletes, Deltoidospora, Auritulinasporites, Dictyophyllidites, Biretisporites, Neoraistrickia, Baculatisporites, Verrucosisporites, Equisetosporites and Cycadopites. The presence of the genus Classopollis, together with exclusively Triassic taxa suggests that this microflora is, among all the Triassic microfloras known from Argentinian sedimentary basins (Cuyo Basin, Ischigualasto- Villa Union-Basin) the youngest one. The Llantenes microflora is associated with plant megafossils (including large trunks). From both the Chihuido Formation and the Tronquimalal Formation, which covers conformably the former, a Triassic Dicroidium flora is known.",1993,Ameghiniana
"Functional Characterization of Carbohydrate-Binding Modules in a New Alginate Lyase, TsAly7B, from Thalassomonas sp. LD5","Alginate lyases degrade alginate into oligosaccharides, of which the biological activities have vital roles in various fields. Some alginate lyases contain one or more carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs), which assist the function of the catalytic modules. However, the precise function of CBMs in alginate lyases has yet to be fully elucidated. We have identified a new multi-domain alginate lyase, TsAly7B, in the marine bacterium Thalassomonas sp. LD5. This novel lyase contains an N-terminal CBM9, an internal CBM32, and a C-terminal polysaccharide lyase family 7 (PL7) catalytic module. To investigate the specific function of each of these CBMs, we expressed and characterized the full-length TsAly7B and three truncated mutants: TM1 (CBM32-PL7), TM2 (CBM9-PL7), and TM3 (PL7 catalytic module). CBM9 and CBM32 could enhance the degradation of alginate. Notably, the specific activity of TM2 was 7.6-fold higher than that of TM3. CBM32 enhanced the resistance of the catalytic module to high temperatures. In addition, a combination of CBM9 and CBM32 showed enhanced thermostability when incubated at 80 Â°C for 1 h. This is the first report that finds CBM9 can significantly improve the ability of enzyme degradation. Our findings provide new insight into the interrelationships of tandem CBMs and alginate lyases and other polysaccharide-degrading enzymes, which may inspire CBM fusion strategies.",2019,Marine Drugs
[Generalized interaction LASSO based on alternating direction method of multipliers for liver disease classification].,"Features and interaction between features of liver disease is of great significance for the classification of liver disease. Based on least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and interaction LASSO, the generalized interaction LASSO model is proposed in this paper for liver disease classification and compared with other methods. Firstly, the generalized interaction logistic classification model was constructed and the LASSO penalty constraints were added to the interactive model parameters. Then the model parameters were solved by an efficient alternating directions method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. The solutions of model parameters were sparse. Finally, the test samples were fed to the model and the classification results were obtained by the largest statistical probability. The experimental results of liver disorder dataset and India liver dataset obtained by the proposed methods showed that the coefficients of interaction features of the model were not zero, indicating that interaction features were contributive to classification. The accuracy of the generalized interaction LASSO method is better than that of the interaction LASSO method, and it is also better than that of traditional pattern recognition methods. The generalized interaction LASSO method can also be popularized to other disease classification areas.",2017,Sheng wu yi xue gong cheng xue za zhi = Journal of biomedical engineering = Shengwu yixue gongchengxue zazhi
Using the EM algorithm for Bayesian variable selection in logistic regression models with related covariates,"ABSTRACT We develop a Bayesian variable selection method for logistic regression models that can simultaneously accommodate qualitative covariates and interaction terms under various heredity constraints. We use expectation-maximization variable selection (EMVS) with a deterministic annealing variant as the platform for our method, due to its proven flexibility and efficiency. We propose a variance adjustment of the priors for the coefficients of qualitative covariates, which controls false-positive rates, and a flexible parameterization for interaction terms, which accommodates user-specified heredity constraints. This method can handle all pairwise interaction terms as well as a subset of specific interactions. Using simulation, we show that this method selects associated covariates better than the grouped LASSO and the LASSO with heredity constraints in various exploratory research scenarios encountered in epidemiological studies. We apply our method to identify genetic and non-genetic risk factors associated with smoking experimentation in a cohort of Mexican-heritage adolescents.",2018,Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation
Forecasting Chinese GDP with Mixed Frequency Data Set: A Generalized Lasso Granger Method,"In this paper, we introduce an effective machine learning method which can capture the temporal causal structures between irregular time series to forecast China GDP growth rate with Mixed Frequency data set. The introduced method first generalized the inner product operator via kernels so that regression-based temporal casual models can be applicable to irregular time series, then the temporal casual relationships among the irregular time series are studied by Generalized Lasso Granger (GLG) graphical models. The main advantage of this approach is that it does not directly estimate the values of missing data of low frequency time series or has restricted assumptions about the generation process of the time series. By applying this method to a 17 macroeconomic indicators GLG model, the forecasting accuracy is better than the autoregressive (AR) benchmark model and a widely used mixed-data sampling (MIDAS) model.",2013,
Chemical-agnostic hazard prediction: statistical inference of in vitro toxicity pathways from proteomics responses to chemical mixtures.,"Toxicity pathways have been defined as normal cellular pathways that, when sufficiently perturbed as a consequence of chemical exposure, lead to an adverse outcome. If an exposure alters one or more normal biological pathways to an extent that leads to an adverse toxicity outcome, a significant correlation must exist between the exposure, the extent of pathway alteration, and the degree of adverse outcome. Biological pathways are regulated at multiple levels, including transcriptional, post-transcriptional, post-translational, and targeted degradation, each of which can affect the levels and extents of modification of proteins involved in the pathways. Significant alterations of toxicity pathways resulting from changes in regulation at any of these levels therefore are likely to be detectable as alterations in the proteome. We hypothesize that significant correlations between exposures, adverse outcomes, and changes in the proteome have the potential to identify putative toxicity pathways, facilitating selection of candidate targets for high throughput screening, even in the absence of a priori knowledge of either the specific pathways involved or the specific agents inducing the pathway alterations. We explored this hypothesis in vitro in BEAS-2B human airway epithelial cells exposed to different concentrations of Ni2+, Cd2+, and Cr6+, alone and in defined mixtures. Levels and phosphorylation status of a variety of signaling pathway proteins and cytokines were measured after 48 hours exposure, together with cytotoxicity. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) multiple regression was used to identify a subset of these proteins that constitute a putative toxicity pathway capable of predicting cytotoxicity. The putative toxicity pathway for cytotoxicity of these metals and metal mixtures identified by LASSO is composed of phospho-RPS6KB1, phospho-p53, cleaved CASP3, phospho-MAPK8, IL-10, and Hif-1Î±. As this approach does not depend on knowledge of the chemical composition of the mixtures, it may be generally useful for identifying sets of proteins predictive of adverse effects for a variety of mixtures, including complex environmental mixtures of unknown composition.",2017,Computational toxicology
Group variable selection and parameter estimation via Group Berhu method,"The group structure of variables is commonly observed in many settings. The Group Lasso method discovers the group structure and performs group variable selection. We extend the Berhu penalty to the group selection settings and propose the Group Berhu method, including Group Berhu and Logistic Group Berhu model, which performs group selection similar to what the Group Lasso does. We use the block coordinate descent algorithm to solve the Group Berhu problem and Minorization-Maximization algorithm to derive the optimal solution of Logistic Group Berhu problem. The experimental results on synthetic and real datasets show that the Group Berhu model proposed in this paper are competitive method compared with the Group Lasso model.",2017,2017 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics (ICMLC)

Predictor selection for downscaling GCM data with LASSO,"[1]Â Over the last 10Â years, downscaling techniques, including both dynamical (i.e., the regional climate model) and statistical methods, have been widely developed to provide climate change information at a finer resolution than that provided by global climate models (GCMs). Because one of the major aims of downscaling techniques is to provide the most accurate information possible, data analysts have tried a number of approaches to improve predictor selection, which is one of the most important steps in downscaling techniques. Classical methods such as regression techniques, particularly stepwise regression (SWR), have been employed for downscaling. However, SWR presents some limits, such as deficiencies in dealing with collinearity problems, while also providing overly complex models. Thus, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) technique, which is a penalized regression method, is presented as another alternative for predictor selection in downscaling GCM data. It may allow for more accurate and clear models that can properly deal with collinearity problems. Therefore, the objective of the current study is to compare the performances of a classical regression method (SWR) and the LASSO technique for predictor selection. A data set from 9 stations located in the southern region of Quebec that includes 25 predictors measured over 29Â years (from 1961 to 1990) is employed. The results indicate that, due to its computational advantages and its ease of implementation, the LASSO technique performs better than SWR and gives better results according to the determination coefficient and the RMSE as parameters for comparison.",2012,Journal of Geophysical Research
A Bayesian Approach for Graph-constrained Estimation for High-dimensional Regression.,"Many different biological processes are represented by network graphs such as regulatory networks, metabolic pathways, and protein-protein interaction networks. Since genes that are linked on the networks usually have biologically similar functions, the linked genes form molecular modules to affect the clinical phenotypes/outcomes. Similarly, in large-scale genetic association studies, many SNPs are in high linkage disequilibrium (LD), which can also be summarized as a LD graph. In order to incorporate the graph information into regression analysis with high dimensional genomic data as predictors, we introduce a Bayesian approach for graph-constrained estimation (Bayesian GRACE) and regularization, which controls the amount of regularization for sparsity and smoothness of the regression coefficients. The Bayesian estimation with their posterior distributions can provide credible intervals for the estimates of the regression coefficients along with standard errors. The deviance information criterion (DIC) is applied for model assessment and tuning parameter selection. The performance of the proposed Bayesian approach is evaluated through simulation studies and is compared with Bayesian Lasso and Bayesian Elastic-net procedures. We demonstrate our method in an analysis of data from a case-control genome-wide association study of neuroblastoma using a weighted LD graph.",2010,International journal of systems and synthetic biology
Frequency estimation for monophonical music by using a modified VMD method,"In this paper, a new Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) is introduced, and applied to the fundamental frequency estimation of monophonical Turkish maqam music. VMD is a method to decompose an input signal into an ensemble of sub-signals (modes) which is entirely non-recursive. It determines the relevant bands adaptively, and estimates the corresponding modes concurrently. In order to optimally decompose a given signal, VMD seeks an ensemble of modes with narrow-band properties corresponding to the Intrinsic Mode Function (IMF) definition used in Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD). In our proposed modified VMD approach, in order to obtain the bandwidth of a mode, each mode is shifted to baseband by mixing an exponential that is adjusted to the respective center frequency. The bandwidth is estimated through elastic net method that linearly combines penalties of the Lasso and Ridge Regression methods. Simulation results on fundamental frequency estimation of real music and synthetic test data show better performance compared to classical VMD based approach, and other common methods used for music signals, such as YIN and MELODIA based methods.",2017,2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)
Accuracy guarantees for l 1-recovery âˆ—,"We discuss two new methods of recovery of sparse signals from noisy observation based on l1minimization. While they are closely related to the well-known techniques such as Lasso and Dantzig Selector, these estimators come with efficiently verifiable guaranties of performance. By optimizing these bounds with respect to the method parameters we are able to construct the estimators which possess better statistical properties than the commonly used ones. We link our performance estimations to the well known results of Compressive Sensing and justify our proposed approach with an oracle inequality which links the properties of the recovery algorithms and the best estimation performance when the signal support is known. We also show how the estimates can be computed using the Non-Euclidean Basis Pursuit algorithm.",2011,
Isolation of cultivable halophilic Bacillus sp. from the Makgadikgadi Salt Pans in Botswana,"Halophilic bacteria from the Makgadikgadi salt pans in north central Botswana were isolated using culture-dependent methods. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the 16S rRNA gene and phylogenetic analysis were used to identify the strains. Culturing was done aerobically in six different complex salt media. Salt concentrations used were 15, 20, 25 and 30% (2.6, 3.4, 4.3 and 5.1 M, respectively) NaCl, at pH 7.2 to pH 8.0. Four colony morphology types were isolated in axenic cultures comprising Gram-positive cells. Universal bacterial primers were used to amplify 16S rDNA from chromosomal DNA isolated from three of the four distinct colony groups. Restriction enzyme digests analysis of the 16S rDNA revealed seven RFLP types. Five of the RFLP types were subjected to sequencing. Comparison of the 16S rDNA sequence alignment to reference sequence data bases showed samples S2012A3, S2012B2 and S2012B3 to have between 95 and 99% homology to Bacillus sp. BH 164 and Bacillus sp. HS 136, a novel species recently described as Bacillus persepolensis. Isolate S4102D4 showed 95 to 99% homology to Thalassobacillus sp. JY0201 and Thalassobacillus sp. FIB228 and Halobacillus sp. MO56 species. All five isolates had at least 95% similarity to published sequences implying they could be species within the described genera. A sub-tree drawn to compare the isolates indicated two phyletic lines with S4102D4 being an outlying strain and S2012A3, S2012B2 and S2012B3 being a closely related clonal group all of which branch from Bacillus sp. BH 164. Pending conclusive culture, biochemical and polar lipid composition data these microorganisms are regarded as previously un-described and therefore novel species of halophilic bacteria. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________",2011,
Scattome: A Single-Cell Analysis of Targeted Transcriptome Program to Predict Drug Sensitivity of Single Cells within Human Myeloma Tumors,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is characterized by significant genetic diversity at subclonal levels that likely plays a defining role in the heterogeneity of tumor progression, clinical aggressiveness and drug sensitivity. Such heterogeneity is a driving factor in the evolution of MM, from founder clones through outgrowth of subclonal fractions. DNA Sequencing studies on MM samples have indeed demonstrated such heterogeneity in subclonal architecture at diagnosis based on recurrent mutations in pathologically relevant genes that may ultimately to lead to relapse. However, no study so far has reported a predictive gene expression signature that can identify, distinguish and quantify drug sensitive and drug-resistant subpopulations within a bulk population of myeloma cells. In recent years, our laboratory has successfully developed a gene expression profile (GEP)-based signature that could not only distinguish drug response of MM cell lines, but also was effective in stratifying patient outcomes when applied to GEP profiles from MM clinical trials using proteasome inhibitors (PI) as chemotherapeutic agents. Further, we noted myeloma cell lines that responded to the drug often contained residual sub-population of cells that did not respond, and likely were selectively propagated during drug treatment in vitro, and in patients. In this study, we performed targeted qRT-PCR analysis of single cells using a gene panel that included PI sensitivity genes and gene signatures that could discriminate between low and high-risk myeloma followed by intensive bioinformatics and statistical analysis for the classification and prediction of PI response in individual cells within bulk multiple myeloma tumors. Fluidigm9s C1 Single-Cell Auto Prep System was used to perform automated single-cell capture, processing and cDNA synthesis on 576 pre-treatment cells from 12 cell lines representing a wide range of PI-sensitivity and 370 cells from 7 patient samples undergoing PI treatment followed by targeted gene expression profiling of single cells using automated, high-throughput on-chip qRT-PCR analysis using 96.96 Dynamic Array IFCs on the BioMark HD System. Probability of resistance for each individual cell was predicted using a pipeline that employed the machine learning methods Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (radial and sigmoidal), LASSO and kNN (k Nearest Neighbor) for making single-cell GEP data-driven predictions/ decisions. The weighted probabilities from each of the algorithms were used to quantify resistance of each individual cell and plotted using Ensemble forecasting algorithm. Using our drug response GEP signature at the single cell level, we could successfully identify distinct subpopulations of tumor cells that were predicted to be sensitive or resistant to PIs. Subsequently, we developed a R Statistical analysis package (http://cran.r-project.org), SCATTome (Single Cell Analysis of Targeted Transcriptome), that can restructure data obtained from Fluidigm qPCR analysis run, filter missing data, perform scaling of filtered data, build classification models and successfully predict drug response of individual cells and classify each cell9s probability of response based on the targeted transcriptome. We will present the program output as graphical displays of single cell response probabilities. This package provides a novel classification method that has the potential to predict subclonal response to a variety of therapeutic agents.

The use of texture-based radiomics CT analysis to predict outcomes in early-stage non-small cell lung cancer treated with stereotactic ablative radiotherapy.,"OBJECTIVE:
Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) is being increasingly used as a non-invasive treatment for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A non-invasive method to estimate treatment outcomes in these patients would be valuable, especially since access to tissue specimens is often difficult in these cases.


METHODS:
We developed a method to predict survival following SABR in NSCLC patients using analysis of quantitative image features on pre-treatment CT images. We developed a Cox Lasso model based on two-dimensional Riesz wavelet quantitative texture features on CT scans with the goal of separating patients based on survival.


RESULTS:
The median log-rank p-value for 1000 cross-validations was 0.030. Our model was able to separate patients based upon predicted survival. When we added tumor size into the model, the p-value lost its significance, demonstrating that tumor size is not a key feature in the model but rather decreases significance likely due to the relatively small number of events in the dataset. Furthermore, running the model using Riesz features extracted either from the solid component of the tumor or from the ground glass opacity (GGO) component of the tumor maintained statistical significance. However, the p-value improved when combining features from the solid and the GGO components, demonstrating that there are important data that can be extracted from the entire tumor.


CONCLUSIONS:
The model predicting patient survival following SABR in NSCLC may be useful in future studies by enabling prediction of survival-based outcomes using radiomics features in CT images.


ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE:
Quantitative image features from NSCLC nodules on CT images have been found to significantly separate patient populations based on overall survival (p = 0.04). In the long term, a non-invasive method to estimate treatment outcomes in patients undergoing SABR would be valuable, especially since access to tissue specimens is often difficult in these cases.",2019,The British journal of radiology
Comparison of Variable Selection Methods for Forecasting from Short Time Series,"Forecasting from multivariate time series data is a difficult task, made more so in the situation where the number of series (p) is much larger than the length of each series (T), which makes dimension reduction desirable prior to obtaining a model. The LASSO has become a widely-used method to choose relevant covariates out of many candidates, and it has many variations and extensions, such as grouped LASSO, adaptive LASSO, weighted lag adaptive LASSO, and fused LASSO. Of these, only the weighted lag adaptive LASSO and the fused LASSO take into account natural ordering among series. To examine the ability of variations on the LASSO to choose relevant covariates for short time series we use simulations for series with fewer than 50 observations. We then apply the methods to a data set on significant changes in self-reported psycho-social symptoms in the 30 years after the Chornobyl nuclear catastrophe.",2019,2019 IEEE International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics (DSAA)
Generalized â„“1-penalized quantile regression with linear constraints,"Abstract In many application areas, prior subject matter knowledge can be formulated as constraints on parameters in order to get a more accurate fit. A generalized l 1 -penalized quantile regression with linear constraints on parameters is considered, including either linear inequality or equality constraints or both. It allows a general form of penalization, including the usual lasso, the fused lasso and the adaptive lasso as special cases. The KKT conditions of the optimization problem are derived and the whole solution path is computed as a function of the tuning parameter. A formula for the number of degrees of freedom is derived, which is used to construct model selection criteria for selecting optimal tuning parameters. Finally, several simulation studies and two real data examples are presented to illustrate the proposed method.",2020,Comput. Stat. Data Anal.
[Standardization and evaluation of a manual salivation method for the detection of Trypanosoma infection in the tsetse fly (Diptera: Glossinidae)].,"Two methods of salivation of tsetse flies, namely manual salivation and method of Bruce et al. were simultaneously evaluated on 1,702 male uninfected Glossina palpalis palpalis (Zaire), G. palpalis gambiensis (Bobo-Dioulasso), G. p. gambiensis (Maisons-Alfort) et G. morsitans morsitans (Mall) fasted for 23, 48 and 72 hours.

Sparse optimization models with robust sketching and applications,"Author(s): Pham, Vu | Advisor(s): El Ghaoui, Laurent | Abstract: Sparse machine learning has recently emerged as powerful tool to obtain models of high-dimensional data with high degree of interpretability, at low computational cost. The approach has been successfully used in many areas, such as signal and image processing. In sparse learning classification, for example, the prediction accuracy or some other classical measure of performance is not the sole concern: we also wish to be able to better understand which few features are relevant as markers for classification. Furthermore, many of sparse learning tasks in practice, including cross-validation, parameter search, or leave-one-out analysis, involve multiple instances of similar problems, each instance sharing a large part of learning data with the others. In this thesis, we introduce a robust framework for solving these multiple sparse regressions in the form of square-root LASSO problems, based on a sketch of the learning data that uses low-rank approximations. Our approach allows a dramatic reduction in computational effort, while not sacrificingâ€”sometimes even improvingâ€”the statistical performance.We present our technique by first studying sparse optimization with applications in different domain of interests, from text analytics to system design, and then developing theories for robust solutions for sparse regression in multi-instance setting. We also provide comparisons with other heuristics to obtain sparse models in various applications. In more detail, our central contributions from this thesis include:- Identifying key tasks in domains of interests under real-world setting,- Suggesting models that are suitable for these tasks along the axes of computational complexity and model understandability,- Exploiting problem structures when working with multiple instances to robustly improve computation while maintaining high learning performance, and- Proposing applications of our robust solutions in high-dimensional setting.",2016,
Three pauses and three P waves: what is the mechanism?,"A 56-year-old man with a 6-year history of symptomatic drug refractory idiopathic persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) attended for catheter ablation. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated normal biventricular systolic function with a dilated left atrium at 58 mm in the parasternal longaxis view. For the electrophysiological procedure, a decapolar catheter was placed into the coronary sinus from the right femoral vein, while a decapolar circumferential catheter (Lasso, Biosense Webster, Diamond Bar, CA, USA) and a quadripolar cooled-tip ablation catheter (Thermocool Biosense Webster) were similarly inserted to the left atrium via a single transseptal puncture. At the start of the procedure, left and right AF cycle lengths (AFCL) were measured from the left and right atrial appendages at 124 ms and 125 ms, respectively. After proximal isolation of all pulmonary veins, electrogram-based ablation was carried out by targeting complex atrial potentials at the inferior left atrium, the left interatrial septum, the left atrial appendage, and along the left atrial roof. This prolonged AFCL to 177 ms in the left atrium but only 136 ms in the right atrium, suggesting that the driving activity was emanating from the right atrium. With ablation of the most rapid right atrial electrograms, located at the superior vena cava/right atrial junction, the patient converted to a regular atrial tachycardia with a cycle length of 184 ms. Throughout the case, there were a number of pauses that helped with both mapping and ablation of the atrial tachycardia. How does the pause seen in Figure 1 help with mapping, and what is happening during and after ablation in Figures 2 and 3, respectively?",2008,Journal of cardiovascular electrophysiology
Investigation of the Biosynthesis of the Lasso Peptide Chaxapeptin Using an E. coli-Based Production System.,"Lasso peptides are natural products belonging to the family of ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides (RiPPs) and are defined by their unique topology. Even though lasso peptide biosynthetic gene clusters are found in many different kinds of bacteria, most of the hitherto studied lasso peptides were of proteobacterial or actinobacterial origin. Despite this, no E. coli-based production system has been reported for actinobacterial lasso peptides, while there are numerous examples of this for proteobacterial lasso peptides. Here, a heterologous production system of the lasso peptide chaxapeptin was established in E. coli. Chaxapeptin, originally isolated from Streptomyces leeuwenhoekii strain C58, is closely related to the lasso peptide sungsanpin (produced by a marine Streptomyces sp.) and shares its inhibitory activity against cell invasion by the human lung cancer cell line A549. Our production system not only allowed isolation of the mature lasso peptide outside of the native producer with a yield of 0.1 mg/L (compared to 0.7 mg/L from S. leeuwenhoekii) but also was used for a mutational study to identify residues in the precursor peptide that are important for biosynthesis. In addition to these experiments, the stability of chaxapeptin against thermal denaturation and proteases was assessed.",2018,Journal of natural products

Imaging phenotype using radiomics to predict dry pleural dissemination in non-small cell lung cancer.,"Background
Dry pleural dissemination (DPD) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is defined as having solid pleural metastases without malignant pleural effusion. We aim to identify DPD by applying radiomics, a novel approach to decode the tumor phenotype.


Methods
Preoperative chest computed tomographic images and basic clinical feature were retrospectively evaluated in patients with surgically resected NSCLC between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2016. Propensity score was applied to match the DPD and non-DPD groups. One thousand and eighty radiomics features were quantitatively extracted by the 3D slicer software and ""pyradiomics"" package. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) binary model was applied for feature selection and developing the radiomics signature. The discrimination was evaluated using area under the curve (AUC) and Youden index.


Results
Sixty-four DPD patients and paired 192 non-DPD patients were enrolled. Using the LASSO model, this study developed a radiomics signature including 10 radiomic features. The mean Â± standard deviation values of the radiomics signature with DPD status (-2.129Â±1.444) was significantly higher compared to those with non-DPD disease (0.071Â±0.829, P<0.001). The ten-feature based signature showed good discrimination between DPD and non-DPD, with an AUC of 0.93 (95% confidence-interval, 0.891-0.958) respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the radiomics signature was 85.94% and 85.94%, with the optimal cut-off value of -0.696 and Youden index of 0.71.


Conclusions
The signature based on radiomics features can provide potential predictive value to identify DPD in patients with NSCLC.",2019,Annals of translational medicine
Viveiros From anthropology to philosophy Introduction to Eduardo Viveiros de,"R a d i c a l P h i l o s o p h y 1 8 2 ( N o v e m b e r / D e c e m b e r 2 0 1 3 ) Can anthropology be philosophy, and if so, how? For philosophers, the matter has been and often remains quite simple: anthropologyâ€™s concern with socio-cultural and historical differences might yield analyses that philosophy can put to use (provided that it condescends to examine them), but only rarely does anthropology conceive its material at a level of generality or in relation to metaphysical issues in their positivity that would allow it to really do philosophy, especially of an ontological kind. Anthropologists, on the other hand, tend not to disagree, whether out of a preference for local problems or from the more canny recognition that even the best philosophers prove quite adept at mistaking modern ideological values for transcendental concepts. Such perspectives, however, are proving outmoded in the face of a now sizable group of thinkers, ranging from Bruno Latour and Isabelle Stengers to Marilyn Strathern to FranÃ§ois Jullien, whose questions, concepts, objects and methods belong in different ways to both anthropology and philosophy, and who moreover propose that certain aspects of anthropology â€“ analyses of scientific practices, knowledge of cultural variation, and an old thing called structuralism â€“ are key to a new metaphysics as empirical, pluralistic and comparative as transcendental, unifying and general. One of the chief instigators of this new approach is the Brazilian anthropologist and now philosopher Eduardo Viveiros de Castro, whose 2009 MÃ©taphysiques Cannibales perhaps marks the first case of an â€˜actualâ€™ anthropologist, in the disciplinary sense, explicitly undertaking such a philosophy. (And â€˜realâ€™ philosophers agree: the book was published alongside those of Ã‰tienne Souriau, Tristan Garcia and Graham Harman in the Presses Universitaires de France series, edited by Quentin Meillassoux, Patrice Maniglier and others, entitled â€˜MÃ©taphysiqueSâ€™.) A native of Rio (and carioca irony) who did fieldwork with a Northeastern Amazonian Indian group known as the ArawatÃ©, Viveiros de Castro is widely known in social anthropology for showing that what falls under the domain of â€˜socialâ€™ and â€˜humanâ€™ relations for such Amazonian peoples is so broad â€“ animals, plants, spirits are all conceived as persons â€“ that modern distinctions between nature and culture, animals and humans, and even descent and marriage ties are effectively inverted. A generalized â€˜potentialâ€™ or â€˜virtual affinityâ€™ obtains (â€˜affinityâ€™ is the kinship term for relations established through marriage) wherein beings, because they are all initially related and thus â€˜socialâ€™, must be established as â€˜naturalâ€™ and substantial in the same way that conventional, cultural ones elsewhere have to be. The means of doing that, from hunting to ritual to shamanism, involve contending with the additional fact that every relatable entity is conceived as having, whatever its bodily form, a soul â€“ intentionality and apperception â€“ of a â€˜humanâ€™ character, and that all beings thus perceive themselves as humans, and other beings as either animals or cultural artefacts. Jaguars, for example, are thought to see themselves as humans, to see humans as human prey like peccarys and monkeys, and their own food as that of humans (blood as manioc beer). Successfully negotiating oneâ€™s relations with other beings therefore requires adopting their perspectives, as shamans do when they become animals, in order to know what they see things as being, and thereby in turn anticipating and knowing them as definite beings. What emerges from this â€˜perspectivistâ€™ universe, Viveiros de Castro continually emphasizes, is an ontology that reverses the terms of one of our most fundamental metaphysical dualisms. Because perspectivism confers on all beings the same ontological status, and distinguishing between them requires knowing the differences between their bodies, â€˜cultureâ€™ becomes the underlying domain uniting beings in Amazonia and nature the differential, separating one. A â€˜multinaturalismâ€™ effectively prevails that is the converse of our naturalist multiculturalism. Yet how Amazonian cosmology might function as a metaphysics for us goes well beyond its upsetting of our certainties about nature and culture and right to the core of contemporary philosophical debate. Although MÃ©taphysiques Cannibales might appear to confirm, as nothing else has, that the forms of thought of indigenous peoples accord a central role to relations, virtualities and becomings in the way Deleuze claimed, Amerindian thought flips more than just the metaphysical poles by which modernity orients itself but also the very terms by which even critical, minor philosophies have conceptualized them.

The Rhetoric and Reality of Anthropomorphism in Artificial Intelligence,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has historically been conceptualized in anthropomorphic terms. Some algorithms deploy biomimetic designs in a deliberate attempt to effect a sort of digital isomorphism of the human brain. Others leverage more general learning strategies that happen to coincide with popular theories of cognitive science and social epistemology. In this paper, I challenge the anthropomorphic credentials of the neural network algorithm, whose similarities to human cognition I argue are vastly overstated and narrowly construed. I submit that three alternative supervised learning methodsâ€”namely lasso penalties, bagging, and boostingâ€”offer subtler, more interesting analogies to human reasoning as both an individual and a social phenomenon. Despite the temptation to fall back on anthropomorphic tropes when discussing AI, however, I conclude that such rhetoric is at best misleading and at worst downright dangerous. The impulse to humanize algorithms is an obstacle to properly conceptualizing the ethical challenges posed by emerging technologies.",2019,Minds and Machines
Pollen wall and stigma surface in the marine angiosperms Thalassia and Thalassodendron,"Abstract The pollen wall and stigma surface of two tropical sea-grasses, Thalassia hemprichii and Thalassodendron ciliatum, have been investigated by electron microscopy and optical cytochemistry. In the spherical inaperturate pollen of Thalassia the exine consists of free bacula with a rudimentary foot layer and endexine. Non-specific esterase activity has been detected in the intine. The enzyme seems to be introduced into the layer at the vacuolate stage when evaginations extend from the spore cytoplasm. The stigma in Thalassia is papillate and the papillae are covered by a pellicle in which esterase activity has been detected. The implications of exterase in the pollen wall and stigma surface in post-pollination behaviour in Thalassia are discussed with reference to terrestrial species. The exine of the filamentous pollen of Thalassodendron is unstructured and unornamented and gives a negative reaction for esterase. The stigma in Thalassodendron bears irregular ridges and hollows and does not have a pellicle.",1976,Micron
Recovering Sparse Signals With a Certain Family of Nonconvex Penalties and DC Programming,"This paper considers the problem of recovering a sparse signal representation according to a signal dictionary. This problem could be formalized as a penalized least-squares problem in which sparsity is usually induced by a lscr1-norm penalty on the coefficients. Such an approach known as the Lasso or Basis Pursuit Denoising has been shown to perform reasonably well in some situations. However, it was also proved that nonconvex penalties like the pseudo lscrq-norm with q < 1 or smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) penalty are able to recover sparsity in a more efficient way than the Lasso. Several algorithms have been proposed for solving the resulting nonconvex least-squares problem. This paper proposes a generic algorithm to address such a sparsity recovery problem for some class of nonconvex penalties. Our main contribution is that the proposed methodology is based on an iterative algorithm which solves at each iteration a convex weighted Lasso problem. It relies on the family of nonconvex penalties which can be decomposed as a difference of convex functions (DC). This allows us to apply DC programming which is a generic and principled way for solving nonsmooth and nonconvex optimization problem. We also show that several algorithms in the literature dealing with nonconvex penalties are particular instances of our algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed generic framework compared to existing algorithms, including iterative reweighted least-squares methods.",2009,IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing
Study of Peptidyl Arginine Deiminases 4 (PAD 4) Antibodies in Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is one of the most commonly occurring form of inflammatory polyarthritis. If untreated,20%â€“30% of RA patients become debilitated within the first three years following initial diagnosis. The clinical examinationoften fail to identify patients with early RA partly due to heterogeneity of disease presentation and course. To meet the needfor improved diagnostic and prognostic tests, various serum biomarkers are being assessed, including a wide range ofautoantibodies. Autoantibodies against peptidyl arginine deiminase type 4 (PAD-4) have recently been described as a specificbiomarker in subjects with clinically apparent RA. In this study, we tested the presence of anti-PAD4 antibodies in 40Egyptian subjects with RA and their first degree relatives in order to determine whether these autoantibodies play a role inearly disease evolution. In addition, we aimed to describe the Anti-PAD4 relation to anti-CCP autoantibodies, and potentialassociations with a more severe RA phenotype. The study was carried out on total of 100 subjects divided into; 40 RApatients, 40 of first degree relatives (sister or brother) of RA patients and 20 matched controls. Results: The resultsindicated that the serum level of Anti-PAD 4 is increased in Egyptian RA patients and their relatives and has a positiveassociation with disease activity. Also its level together with Anti-CCP provides a good diagnostic tool of RA. Conclusion:The serum level of Anti-PAD4 may provide diagnostic information of RA and may be considered as an early marker of thedisease among the first degree relatives of RA patients.

Bayesian Inference in Sparse Gaussian Graphical Models,"One of the fundamental tasks of science is to find explainable relationships between observed phenomena. One approach to this task that has received attention in recent years is based on probabilistic graphical modelling with sparsity constraints on model structures. In this paper, we describe two new approaches to Bayesian inference of sparse structures of Gaussian graphical models (GGMs). One is based on a simple modification of the cutting-edge block Gibbs sampler for sparse GGMs, which results in significant computational gains in high dimensions. The other method is based on a specific construction of the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler, which results in further significant improvements. We compare our fully Bayesian approaches with the popular regularisation-based graphical LASSO, and demonstrate significant advantages of the Bayesian treatment under the same computing costs. We apply the methods to a broad range of simulated data sets, and a real-life financial data set.",2013,ArXiv

The sea-water masses in the Adriatic Sea are fairly well known as regards the classical parameters of salinity, temperature and density. By contrast, the distribution of the oxygen isotopie composition is practically unknown apart from a few isolated measurements. The 81So values of about 600 water samples from vertical profiles in the Adriatic basin were measured to obtain information on the distribution of these values throughout the basin and, if possible, to correlate this variable to the movements and mixing of water masses. The salinity and temperature data are also reported here for a direct comparison of these variables to the isotopie values. Quite positive and homogeneous 81SO values, ranging from 1.30 to 1.69 %o (vs. V -SMOW), are found in the Sou them Adriatic Sea because of the inflow of Levantine Intermediate Water (LIW). The northward flow of this water, despite the addition of large amounts of continental water, heavily depleted in ISo (8180 about -9/-10 %o), apparently reaches the north-eastern section of the basin, with bottom water still showing high 81So values (up to 1.36 %o) as far north as the Gulf of Trieste. By contrast, the surface water of the Northem Adriatic Sea is almost systematically ISo depleted with a minimum value of -1.49 %o measured during Spring 1991, clearly related to the inflow of continental water.

Online clustering of individual sequences,"We know that $\ell_0$-penalized methods have good theoretical properties but unfortunately high computational cost. On the contrary, convex relaxations - such as the Lasso - have been introduced but their theoretical guarantees hold for restricted models. To tackle this impasse, \cite{dalalyantsybakov2,dalalyantsybakov3} come up with sparsity priors in a Pac-Bayesian framework. They give rise to good theoretical properties, i.e. sparsity oracle inequalities, reached by computationally attractive sequential procedures. In this paper, we investigate this issue in clustering. We construct online \textit{clustering} algorithms which learn according to the following game protocol. At each trial $t\geq 1$, nature reveals a deterministic $x_t\in\R^d$, $d\geq 1$. A forecaster predicts the next value with several - and as small as possible - proposals. Then, nature reveals the next value and the forecaster pays the minimal distance between this value and its set of proposals. To deal with this problem, we use the Pac-Bayesian theory with group-sparsity priors. It gives sparsity regret bounds and allows us to perform online clustering of a possible non-stationnary process, without any knowledge about the number of clusters. These results can be applied to the classical i.i.d. case to deal with the problem of model selection clustering as well as high dimensional clustering.",2014,
"Sleep duration, daytime napping, markers of obstructive sleep apnea and stroke in a population of southern China","Sleep habits are associated with stroke in western populations, but this relation has been rarely investigated in China. Moreover, the differences among stroke subtypes remain unclear. This study aimed to explore the associations of total stroke, including ischemic and hemorrhagic type, with sleep habits of a population in southern China. We performed a case-control study in patients admitted to the hospital with first stroke and community control subjects. A total of 333 patients (nâ€‰=â€‰223, 67.0%, with ischemic stroke; nâ€‰=â€‰110, 23.0%, with hemorrhagic stroke) and 547 controls were enrolled in the study. Participants completed a structured questionnaire to identify sleep habits and other stroke risk factors. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) and multiple logistic regression were performed to identify risk factors of disease. Incidence of stroke, and its subtypes, was significantly associated with snorting/gasping, snoring, sleep duration, and daytime napping. Snorting/gasping was identified as an important risk factor in the Lasso logistic regression model (Lasso' Î²â€‰=â€‰0.84), and the result was proven to be robust. This study showed the association between stroke and sleep habits in the southern Chinese population and might help in better detecting important sleep-related factors for stroke risk.",2016,Scientific Reports
Brouwerâ€™s Fixed Point Theorem and Sparsity,"In the generalized linear model and its relatives, the loss depends on the parameter via a transformation (the inverse link function) of the linear function (or linear predictor). In this chapter such a structure is not assumed. Moreover, the chapter hints at cases where the effective parameter space is very large and the localization arguments discussed so far cannot be applied. (The graphical Lasso is an example.) With the help of Brouwerâ€™s fixed point theorem it is shown that when \(\dot{R}(\beta )\) is Î©âˆ—-close to its linear approximation when Î² is Î©âˆ—-close to the target Î²0, then also the Î©-structured sparsity M-estimator \(\hat{\beta }\) is Î©âˆ—-close to the target. Here, the second derivative inverse matrix \(\ddot{R}^{-1}(\beta ^{0})\) is assumed to have Î©-small enough rows, where Î© is the dual norm of Î©âˆ—. Next, weakly decomposable norms Î© are considered. A generalized irrepresentable condition on a set S of indices yields that there is a solution \(\tilde{\beta }_{S}\) of the KKT-conditions with zeroes outside the set S. At such a solution \(\tilde{\beta }_{S}\) the problem is under certain conditions localized, so that one can apply the linear approximation of \(\dot{R}(\beta )\). This scheme is carried out for exponential families and in particular for the graphical Lasso.",2016,
Expanding the BLUP alphabet for genomic prediction adaptable to the genetic architectures of complex traits,"Improvement of statistical methods is crucial for realizing the potential of increasingly dense genetic markers. Bayesian methods treat all markers as random effects, exhibit an advantage on dense markers, and offer the flexibility of using different priors. In contrast, genomic best linear unbiased prediction (gBLUP) is superior in computing speed, but only superior in prediction accuracy for extremely complex traits. Currently, the existing variety in the BLUP method is insufficient for adapting to new sequencing technologies and traits with different genetic architectures. In this study, we found two ways to change the kinship derivation in the BLUP method that improve prediction accuracy while maintaining the computational advantage. First, using the settlement under progressively exclusive relationship (SUPER) algorithm, we substituted all available markers with estimated quantitative trait nucleotides (QTNs) to derive kinship. Second, we compressed individuals into groups based on kinship, and then used the groups as random effects instead of individuals. The two methods were named as SUPER BLUP (sBLUP) and compressed BLUP (cBLUP). Analyses on both simulated and real data demonstrated that these two methods offer flexibility for evaluating a variety of traits, covering a broadened realm of genetic architectures. For traits controlled by small numbers of genes, sBLUP outperforms Bayesian LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator). For traits with low heritability, cBLUP outperforms both gBLUP and Bayesian LASSO methods. We implemented these new BLUP alphabet series methods in an R package, Genome Association and Prediction Integrated Tool (GAPIT), available at http://zzlab.net/GAPIT.",2018,Heredity
"Gene expression network analysis of lymph node involvement in colon cancer identifies AHSA2, CDK10, and CWC22 as possible prognostic markers","Colon cancer has been well studied using a variety of molecular techniques, including whole genome sequencing. However, genetic markers that could be used to predict lymph node (LN) involvement, which is the most important prognostic factor for colon cancer, have not been identified. In the present study, we compared LN(+) and LN(âˆ’) colon cancer patients using differential gene expression and network analysis. Colon cancer gene expression data were obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas and divided into two groups, LN(+) and LN(âˆ’). Gene expression networks were constructed using LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression. We identified hub genes, such as APBB1, AHSA2, ZNF767, and JAK2, that were highly differentially expressed. Survival analysis using selected hub genes, such as AHSA2, CDK10, and CWC22, showed that their expression levels were significantly associated with the survival rate of colon cancer patients, which indicates their possible use as prognostic markers. In addition, protein-protein interaction network, GO enrichment, and KEGG pathway analysis were performed with selected hub genes from each group to investigate the regulatory relationships between hub genes and LN involvement in colon cancer; these analyses revealed differences between the LN(âˆ’) and LN(+) groups. Our network analysis may help narrow down the search for novel candidate genes for the treatment of colon cancer, in addition to improving our understanding of the biological processes underlying LN involvement.

"Thalassoma lunare (Linnaeus, 1758)","Thalassoma lunare is also named the Moon Wrasse because of its yellow caudal fin shapes like crescent moon with long upper and lower lobes. It is an inhabitant of coral reefs and surrounding areas at depths from 1 to 20. T. lunare is the most abundant wrasse species in the Persian Gulf. This species can reach 16 cm in total length in Iran, Persian Gulf, Kish Island. Moon wrasses are active fish, said to be moving all day long. They are also territorial, nipping, chasing, and otherwise harassing fish that get in their way. Being diurnal, wrasses have strong vision, although they also have a decent sense of smell. At night, they rest in niches often under rocks or other such structures. If needed, a moon wrasse may dig out a space under a rock by repeatedly swimming through it until it fits without struggle. They are protogynous hermaphrodites, all starting off as females and changing to males, a process which, for the moon wrasse, takes only 10 days. Some moon wrasses live in groups consisted of a dominant male, and a ""harem"" of about a dozen other wrasses, some female and some male. The alpha male is more brightly colored, and at every low tide hour, changes from green to blue, and goes into a show of attacking and nipping all the other wrasses. This is his way of showing his dominance to the rest of the males and keeping the females in check. During breeding season and before high tide, the alpha male turns completely blue, gathers up every single female, and the spawning frenzy begins.",2016,
Isolation and identification of a new lasso peptide cattlecin from Streptomyces cattleya based on genome mining,"Lasso peptides are ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides with diverse biological functions. Recent genome mining has revealed that many species of actinomycetes possibly contain biosynthetic gene clusters of lasso peptides. With genome mining for lasso peptide biosynthesis, we screened several actinomycetes for lasso peptide production using high-performance liquid chromatography and electrospray ionizationâ€“mass spectrometry. Consequently, Streptomyces cattleya was identified as a producer of a new lasso peptide named cattlecin. Analysis of amino acid contentÂ on cattlecin indicated the presence of four moles each of Asp and His, three moles each of Gly and Tyr, and one mole of Ser. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis of cattlecin revealed C-terminal sequence of WHHGWYGWWDD. The peptide sequence (SYHWGDYHDWHHGWYGWWDD) was the expected amino acid sequence of cattlecin based on genome mining. As a result of MS/MS analysis, the amine residue of the first Ser was proposed to form a macrolactam ring with the Î²-carboxyl residue of the ninth Asp. The biosynthetic gene cluster of cattlecin comprised four genes: catA, catC, catB1, and catB2, which is typical of a lasso peptide biosynthetic gene cluster in actinomycetes.",2017,Applied Biological Chemistry

Assessing Hospital Performance in Iran Using the Pabon Lasso Model,"Background: Hospitals account for a large share of healthcare system expenditure. Therefore efficient use of resources is a significant goal in all healthcare systems, particularly hospitals. This study was conducted to assess the performance of hospitals affiliated with Qazvin University of Medical Sciences in Iran using the Pabon Lasso Graphical Model during 2008-2010. Method: This cross-sectional study was implemented in six hospitals affiliated with Qazvin University of Medical Sciences. Related data were collected from Qazvin statistical documents during three different years from 2008 to 2010. The statistical software Excel was used to derive three basic performance indicators, namely Average Length of Stay (ALS), Bed Occupancy Rate (BOR) and Bed Turnover (BTO), which were analysed using the Pabon Lasso model. Findings: The overall ALS, BOR and BTO rates were 4.1 days, 68.9% and 61.1 respectively. Just two out of the six hospitals were located in the third zone of the Pabon Lasso diagram with high and acceptable efficiency. Two of the hospitals were in the fourth zone, characteristic of a high BOR but a low BTO rate and low productivity. One out of the six hospitals was located in the second zone of the graph indicating the low BOR and a high BTO rate. One of the other hospitals was situated in the second zone of the diagram in the year 2008, and had then fallen to the first zone during the next years with a low BTO rate and low BOR. Conclusion: Just two out of six hospitals were located in the zone 3 indicating high and acceptable efficiency. This shows that the rest of the hospitals need more improvements in managerial decisions in order to enhance their efficiency and productivity.

Distinction and Potential Prediction of Lung Metastasis in Patients with Malignant Primary Osseous Spinal Neoplasms.,"STUDY DESIGN
Retrospective analysis.


OBJECTIVE
The aim of this study was to develop and validate a nomogram for the prediction of lung metastasis in patients with malignant primary spinal tumors.


SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA
In patients with malignant primary spinal tumors, lung metastasis is usually found by computed tomography (CT) and is considered to be an essential factor affecting the prognosis and survival.


METHODS
We retrospectively collected 580 malignant primary osseous spinal neoplasms patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database between 2010 and 2015. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and multivariate logistic analysis were used to identify independent factors. These prognostic factors were included in the nomograms. The nomograms were validated based on its calibration, discrimination, and clinical utility. The overall survival of the patients was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and the survival differences were tested by the log-rank test.


RESULTS
We randomly divided all these patients (nâ€Š=â€Š580) into a training cohort (nâ€Š=â€Š408) and a validation cohort (nâ€Š=â€Š172). The results showed that the risk of lung metastasis was independently influenced by histologic type, use of surgery, clinical T stage, clinical N stage, and tumor extension (all Pâ€Š<â€Š0.05). The nomogram consisted of five clinical features and provided good calibration and discrimination in the training and validation cohort, with an area under the curve of 0.858 and 0.811, respectively. Decision curve analysis showed that the nomogram was clinically useful. The Kaplan-Meier curves showed a significant difference between the higher and lower risk of lung metastasis groups (Pâ€Š<â€Š0.001).


CONCLUSION
Nomograms were developed to predict the risk of lung metastasis in patients with malignant primary spinal tumors. The nomogram showed favorable discrimination and calibration values, which may help optimize treatment decision-making for patients.

US diagnosis of sciatic nerve tumor proximal to gluteal fold,"High-resolution ultrasound (US) is a helpful technique for the evaluation of peripheral nerves. It is now well accepted that especially in nerve mononeuropaties the combination of morphological data, obtained through US, and functional data, obtained through electrophysiology, is the appropriate way to reach the best diagnosis including information for therapeutical decision. Literature data show that US may crucially influence diagnosis and clinical care in nerve tumors [1, 2]. However, nerve US has some limitations. In particular the visualization of deep nerves is difficult, especially in overweight people. This is the case of proximal part of sciatic nerve that is commonly detectable only distal to the gluteal fold. We report on a 48-year-old woman complaining of pain and electric shocks radiated to sciatic course and trigger point in the right gluteal region. Clinical examination showed only mild right extensor hallucis longus weakness. Needle electromyography of tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius, peroneus longus was normal and mild chronic neurogenic recruitment was observed in extensor hallucis longus. It was suspected a right L5 radiculopathy but magnetic resonance (MR) showed only a mild L5â€“S1 bulging that was not considered the cause of symptoms. US of sciatic nerve was then performed although the trigger point was in a region where usually sciatic nerve is not detectable, proximally to the gluteal fold. US was performed using a linear 6â€“10 and 10â€“18 MHz transducer and sciatic nerve was bilaterally evaluated in distalâ€“proximal direction starting from the popliteal fossa. Right sciatic nerve was detectable along all its course, even proximally to the gluteal fold although with no optimal visualization. At the middle-third of the gluteus a fusiform hypoechoic increase of nerve volume was found. The maximum longitudinal diameter was 2.5 cm and maximum antero-posterior diameter was 2.0 cm (max cross-sectional area 4.5 cm). An accurate evaluation of the US video clip suggested that the mass raised from lateral fascicles sparing and dislocating remaining medial fascicles (Fig. 1a, b). US and clinical data suggested a sciatic nerve tumor, likely a schwannoma. MR confirmed the lesion showing a partially preserved fascicular structure, suggesting a schwannoma (Fig. 1câ€“f). Surgical excision was refused by the patient and US monitoring planned. Our case report confirms the usefulness of US in the diagnosis of nerve tumors. US is not able to clearly differentiate the type of nerve tumor but can provide useful information to discriminate between the two main types, schwannoma or neurofibroma [3â€“5]. Schwannoma typically displaces the nerve fascicles and generally is positioned eccentrically to the affected nerve segment. Another typical feature especially of large lesions is the presence of hyperechoic calcifications and internal degenerative cystic foci. On the other side neurofibroma presents as a concentric lesion that does not displace the fascicular elements of the nerve but interferes with them (usually fascicles are not detectable).

A regularization approach for stable estimation of loss development factors,"In this article, we show that a new penalty function, which we call log-adjusted absolute deviation (LAAD), emerges if we theoretically extend the Bayesian LASSO using conjugate hyperprior distributional assumptions. We further show that the estimator with LAAD penalty has closed-form in the case with a single covariate and it can be extended to general cases when combined with coordinate descent algorithm with assurance of convergence under mild conditions. This has the advantages of avoiding unnecessary model bias as well as allowing variable selection, which is linked to the choice of tail factor in loss development for claims reserving. We calibrate our proposed model using a multi-line insurance dataset from a property and casualty company where we observe reported aggregate loss along the accident years and development periods.",2020,
Methods for population-based eQTL analysis in human genetics,"Gene expression is a critical process in biological system that is influenced and modulated by many factors including genetic variation. Expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL) analysis provides a powerful way to understand how genetic variants affect gene expression. For genome wide eQTL analysis, the number of genetic variants and that of genes are large and thus the search space is tremendous. Therefore, eQTL analysis brings about computational and statistical challenges. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of recent advances in methods for eQTL analysis in population-based studies. We first present traditional pairwise association methods, which are widely used in human genetics. To account for expression heterogeneity, we investigate the methods for correcting confounding factors. Next, we discuss newly developed statistical learning methods including Lasso-based models. In the conclusion, we provide an overview of future method development in analyzing eQTL associations. Although we focus on human genetics in this review, the methods are applicable to many other organisms.",2014,Tsinghua Science & Technology
Pattern Alternating Maximization Algorithm for High-Dimensional Missing Data,"We propose a new and computationally efficient algorithm for maximizing the observed log-likelihood for a multivariate normal data matrix with missing values. We show that our procedure based on iteratively regressing the missing on the observed variables, generalizes the traditional EM algorithm by alternating between different complete data spaces and performing the E-Step incrementally. In this nonstandard setup we prove numerical convergence to a stationary point of the observed log-likelihood. For high-dimensional data, where the number of variables may greatly exceed sample size, we add a Lasso penalty in the regression part of our algorithm and perform coordinate descent approximations. This leads to a computationally very attractive technique with sparse regression coefficients for missing data imputation. Simulations and results on four microarray datasets show that the new method often outperforms alternative imputation techniques as k-nearest neighbors imputation, nuclear norm minimization or a penalized likelihood approach with an l1-penalty on the inverse covariance matrix.",2010,
Genomic selection for boar taint compounds and carcass traits in a commercial pig population,"This study aimed to compare two different Genome-Wide Selection (GWS) methods (Ridge Regression BLUP âˆ’ RR-BLUP and Bayesian LASSO âˆ’ BL) to predict the genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) of four phenotypes, including two boar taint compounds, i.e., the concentrations of androstenone (andro) and skatole (ska), and two carcass traits, i.e., backfat thickness (fat) and loin depth (loin), which were measured in a commercial male pig line. Six hundred twenty-two boars were genotyped for 2,500 previously selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The accuracies of the GEBV using both methods were estimated based on Jack-knife cross-validation. The BL showed the best performance for the andro, ska and loin traits, which had accuracy values of 0.65, 0.58 and 0.33, respectively; for the fat trait, the RR-BLUP accuracy of 0.61 outperformed the BL accuracy of 0.56. Considering that BL was more accurate for the majority of the traits, this method is the most favoured for GWS under the conditions of this study. The most relevant SNPs for each trait were located in the chromosome regions that were previously indicated as QTL regions in other studies, i.e., SSC6 for andro and ska, SSC2 for fat, and SSC11, SSC15 and SSC17 for loin.",2015,Livestock Science

Video-to-shot tag allocation by weighted sparse group lasso,"Traditional shot tagging techniques are focused on learning and propagating the tags at the same level, that is from labeled training shots to the unknown test shots. Due to the lack of sufficient labeled video shots, effective shot tagging remains challenging. By observing that video-level tags are more widely provided, we design a novel approach to propagate video-level tags to the test shots. A weighted sparse group lasso method (WSGL) is proposed for shot reconstruction, which well preserves the structural sparsity to reduce the noise in tag propagation. Meanwhile, it simultaneously considers the spatial-temporal information within the video corpus to enhance the tagging performance. Extensive experiments are conducted on two public video datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",2011,
High-dimensional posterior consistency of the Bayesian lasso,"ABSTRACT This paper considers posterior consistency in the context of high-dimensional variable selection using the Bayesian lasso algorithm. In a frequentist setting, consistency is perhaps the most basic property that we expect any reasonable estimator to achieve. However, in a Bayesian setting, consistency is often ignored or taken for granted, especially in more complex hierarchical Bayesian models. In this paper, we have derived sufficient conditions for posterior consistency in the Bayesian lasso model with the orthogonal design, where the number of parameters grows with the sample size.",2016,Communications in Statistics - Theory and Methods
Incorporating prior information with fused sparse group lasso: Application to prediction of clinical measures from neuroimages.,"Predicting clinical variables from whole-brain neuroimages is a high-dimensional problem that can potentially benefit from feature selection or extraction. Penalized regression is a popular embedded feature selection method for high-dimensional data. For neuroimaging applications, spatial regularization using the â„“ 1 or â„“ 2 norm of the image gradient has shown good performance, yielding smooth solutions in spatially contiguous brain regions. Enormous resources have been devoted to establishing structural and functional brain connectivity networks that can be used to define spatially distributed yet related groups of voxels. We propose using the fused sparse group lasso (FSGL) penalty to encourage structured, sparse, and interpretable solutions by incorporating prior information about spatial and group structure among voxels. We present optimization steps for FSGL penalized regression using the alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm. With simulation studies and in application to real functional magnetic resonance imaging data from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange, we demonstrate conditions under which fusion and group penalty terms together outperform either of them alone.",2019,Biometrics
Consistency analysis and regularization parameter selection for direction-of-arrival estimation based on compressed sensing techniques,"In this report we address the well known problem of estimating the Direction Of Arrival (DOAs) from sensor array data, and discuss it as a linear regression problem by assuming a narrow band, far field model of the sources. Recently, the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) is proposed for such a problem as an approximation to the computationally hard, but precise solution of Maximum Likelihood (ML). We explain the implementation using convex programming tools, and show the superiority of this method by discussing the theoretical bounds of consistency and comparing the results to that of conventional estimators. Furthermore, we give two different solutions for selecting the regularization parameter in the LASSO method. First, by viewing the problem as a model order selection and using Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle and second, by taking the Bayesian nature of regularization into account and deriving an ML estimator for the regularization parameter. Finally, we discuss about the theoretical consistency of such a method for the DOA estimation in some extreme cases. We particularly show that for the noiseless case the method may not be consistent for very close sources. This shows the fundamental resolution of LASSO for the DOA estimation.",2010,
Predicting Physiological Concentrations of Metabolites from Their Molecular Structure,"Physiological concentrations of metabolites can partly be explained by their molecular structure. We hypothesize that substances containing certain chemical groups show increased or decreased concentration in cells. We consider here, as chemical groups, local atomic configurations, describing an atom, its bonds, and its direct neighbor atoms. To test our hypothesis, we fitted a linear statistical model that relates experimentally determined logarithmic concentrations to feature vectors containing count numbers of the chemical groups. In order to determine chemical groups that have a clear effect on the concentration, we use a regularized (lasso) regression. In a dataset on 41 substances of central metabolism in different organisms, we found that the physical concentrations are increased by the occurrence of amino and hydroxyl groups, while aldehydes, ketones, and phosphates show decreased concentrations. The model explains about 22% of the variance of the logarithmic mean concentrations.",2005,Journal of computational biology : a journal of computational molecular cell biology
"Regularized estimation in sparse high-dimensional multivariate regression, with application to a DNA methylation study","Abstract In this article, we consider variable selection for correlated high dimensional DNA methylation markers as multivariate outcomes. A novel weighted square-root LASSO procedure is proposed to estimate the regression coefficient matrix. A key feature of this method is tuning-insensitivity, which greatly simplifies the computation by obviating cross validation for penalty parameter selection. A precision matrix obtained via the constrained â„“1 minimization method is used to account for the within-subject correlation among multivariate outcomes. Oracle inequalities of the regularized estimators are derived. The performance of our proposed method is illustrated via extensive simulation studies. We apply our method to study the relation between smoking and high dimensional DNA methylation markers in the Normative Aging Study (NAS).",2017,Statistical Applications in Genetics and Molecular Biology
The group exponential lasso for bi-level variable selection.,"In many applications, covariates possess a grouping structure that can be incorporated into the analysis to select important groups as well as important members of those groups. One important example arises in genetic association studies, where genes may have several variants capable of contributing to disease. An ideal penalized regression approach would select variables by balancing both the direct evidence of a feature's importance as well as the indirect evidence offered by the grouping structure. This work proposes a new approach we call the group exponential lasso (GEL) which features a decay parameter controlling the degree to which feature selection is coupled together within groups. We demonstrate that the GEL has a number of statistical and computational advantages over previously proposed group penalties such as the group lasso, group bridge, and composite MCP. Finally, we apply these methods to the problem of detecting rare variants in a genetic association study.",2015,Biometrics
Approximate Residual Balancing: De-Biased Inference of Average Treatment Effects in High Dimensions.,"There are many settings where researchers are interested in estimating average treatment effects and are willing to rely on the unconfoundedness assumption, which requires that the treatment assignment be as good as random conditional on pre-treatment variables. The unconfoundedness assumption is often more plausible if a large number of pre-treatment variables are included in the analysis, but this can worsen the performance of standard approaches to treatment effect estimation. In this paper, we develop a method for de-biasing penalized regression adjustments to allow sparse regression methods like the lasso to be used for sqrt{n}-consistent inference of average treatment effects in high-dimensional linear models. Given linearity, we do not need to assume that the treatment propensities are estimable, or that the average treatment effect is a sparse contrast of the outcome model parameters. Rather, in addition standard assumptions used to make lasso regression on the outcome model consistent under 1-norm error, we only require overlap, i.e., that the propensity score be uniformly bounded away from 0 and 1. Procedurally, our method combines balancing weights with a regularized regression adjustment.",2016,arXiv: Methodology

COUSCOus: improved protein contact prediction using an empirical Bayes covariance estimator,"BackgroundThe post-genomic era with its wealth of sequences gave rise to a broad range of protein residue-residue contact detecting methods. Although various coevolution methods such as PSICOV, DCA and plmDCA provide correct contact predictions, they do not completely overlap. Hence, new approaches and improvements of existing methods are needed to motivate further development and progress in the field. We present a new contact detecting method, COUSCOus, by combining the best shrinkage approach, the empirical Bayes covariance estimator and GLasso.ResultsUsing the original PSICOV benchmark dataset, COUSCOus achieves mean accuracies of 0.74, 0.62 and 0.55 for the top L/10 predicted long, medium and short range contacts, respectively. In addition, COUSCOus attains mean areas under the precision-recall curves of 0.25, 0.29 and 0.30 for long, medium and short contacts and outperforms PSICOV. We also observed that COUSCOus outperforms PSICOV w.r.t. Matthewâ€™s correlation coefficient criterion on full list of residue contacts. Furthermore, COUSCOus achieves on average 10% more gain in prediction accuracy compared to PSICOV on an independent test set composed of CASP11 protein targets. Finally, we showed that when using a simple random forest meta-classifier, by combining contact detecting techniques and sequence derived features, PSICOV predictions should be replaced by the more accurate COUSCOus predictions.ConclusionWe conclude that the consideration of superior covariance shrinkage approaches will boost several research fields that apply the GLasso procedure, amongst the presented one of residue-residue contact prediction as well as fields such as gene network reconstruction.",2016,BMC Bioinformatics

Regularity Properties for Sparse Regression,"Statistical and machine learning theory has developed several conditions ensuring that popular estimators such as the Lasso or the Dantzig selector perform well in high-dimensional sparse regression, including the restricted eigenvalue, compatibility, and $$\ell _q$$â„“q sensitivity properties. However, some of the central aspects of these conditions are not well understood. For instance, it is unknown if these conditions can be checked efficiently on any given dataset. This is problematic, because they are at the core of the theory of sparse regression. Here we provide a rigorous proof that these conditions are NP-hard to check. This shows that the conditions are computationally infeasible to verify, and raises some questions about their practical applications. However, by taking an average-case perspective instead of the worst-case view of NP-hardness, we show that a particular condition, $$\ell _q$$â„“q sensitivity, has certain desirable properties. This condition is weaker and more general than the others. We show that it holds with high probability in models where the parent population is well behaved, and that it is robust to certain data processing steps. These results are desirable, as they provide guidance about when the condition, and more generally the theory of sparse regression, may be relevant in the analysis of high-dimensional correlated observational data.",2016,Communications in Mathematics and Statistics

Predictors of High Profit and High Deficit Outliers under SwissDRG of a Tertiary Care Center,"PRINCIPLES
Case weights of Diagnosis Related Groups (DRGs) are determined by the average cost of cases from a previous billing period. However, a significant amount of cases are largely over- or underfunded. We therefore decided to analyze earning outliers of our hospital as to search for predictors enabling a better grouping under SwissDRG.


METHODS
28,893 inpatient cases without additional private insurance discharged from our hospital in 2012 were included in our analysis. Outliers were defined by the interquartile range method. Predictors for deficit and profit outliers were determined with logistic regressions. Predictors were shortlisted with the LASSO regularized logistic regression method and compared to results of Random forest analysis. 10 of these parameters were selected for quantile regression analysis as to quantify their impact on earnings.


RESULTS
Psychiatric diagnosis and admission as an emergency case were significant predictors for higher deficit with negative regression coefficients for all analyzed quantiles (p<0.001). Admission from an external health care provider was a significant predictor for a higher deficit in all but the 90% quantile (p<0.001 for Q10, Q20, Q50, Q80 and p = 0.0017 for Q90). Burns predicted higher earnings for cases which were favorably remunerated (p<0.001 for the 90% quantile). Osteoporosis predicted a higher deficit in the most underfunded cases, but did not predict differences in earnings for balanced or profitable cases (Q10 and Q20: p<0.00, Q50: p = 0.10, Q80: p = 0.88 and Q90: p = 0.52). ICU stay, mechanical and patient clinical complexity level score (PCCL) predicted higher losses at the 10% quantile but also higher profits at the 90% quantile (p<0.001).


CONCLUSION
We suggest considering psychiatric diagnosis, admission as an emergency case and admission from an external health care provider as DRG split criteria as they predict large, consistent and significant losses.",2015,PLoS ONE
Risk Factors Associated with Hospital-Acquired Infections for COVID-19 Patients in ICU,"Background: COVID-19 is an emerging global threat. The severe patients were given supportive treatment in the ICU where is the primary site for the hospital-acquired infections (HAIs). HAIs are an increasing problem resulting in adverse effects for hospitalized patients. Nevertheless, the impact of HAIs on the COVID-19 patients in ICU and its consequences has not been studied. This study is to investigate the HAI rates, impact factors, consequences and bacteria etiology of HAIs for the severe COVID-19 patients in ICU, so as to raise the awareness of the hospital infection control. 
 
Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we screened 62 severe COVID-19 pneumonia patients in the ICU from January 3 rd to March 1 st , 2020 at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University. Demographic and clinical data were collected. The HAI was according to the standard ECDC criteria. The differences of related factors (including demographic characters, onset symptoms, comorbidities, respiratory support, laboratory findings, mortality, hospital stay and costs) between HAI and Non-HAI cohorts were analyzed by Mannâ€“Whitney U tests and t-tests. The independent risk factors of HAIs were performed with LASSO Logistic regression and Multivariable logistic regression. 
 
Findings: The incidence of HAI for the severe COVID-19 patients in ICU were 45.2%. Compared with the patients in Non-HAI group, higher frequency of utilization of invasive ventilation (IV) ( p <0.001), decreased platelet count ( p =0.009) and SpO2 ( p =0.015), prolonged prothrombin time ( p =0.009), higher level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) ( p =0.047), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ( p =0.013), C-reactive protein ( p =0.029), IL-6 ( p =0.035), hospitalization stay ( p =0.010), ICU stay ( p =0.020) and costs ( p <0.001) were observed in HAI group. Although the death rate of HAI group was higher than that in Non-HAI group (32.1% vs. 14.7%), there was no significant difference of mortality between the two groups. The independent risk factors for HAIs were prothrombin time (PT)(OR=2.0), AST (OR=1.032), invasive ventilation (NIV vs IV, OR=0.026), SpO2 (OR=0.884) and length of ICU (OR=1.239). Among these substantial factors, PT and AST were the novel independent risk factors for HAI. Multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (46%) was the most common strain isolated from patients in the HAI group and the lower respiratory tract (61%) was the most common place for nosocomial infection. 
 
Interpretation: We found that PT, AST, IV, SpO2 and ICU stay were the independent risk factors for HAI for the severe COVID-19 patients. The monitoring and prevention methods targeting these factors of HAI should be developed to control the occurrence of nosocomial infection and to reduce the hospitalization time and costs.

Adaptive LASSO for Stochastic Frontier Models with Many Efficient Firms,"The LASSO (Tibshirani, 1996) is applied to select a subset of maximally efficient firms in the fixedeffect stochastic frontier model for panel data of Schmidt and Sickles (1981). Asymptotic properties of the estimator are derived in this context. Under regularity conditions the LASSO estimator exhibits the oracle property, and simulations suggest that it outperforms the least squares dummy variable estimator in terms of the root mean squared error of the estimated firm-level inefficiencies. An application of the LASSO to rice farm data suggests that the resulting subset of maximally efficient firms is comparable to the efficiency subsets calculated from the same data in Horrace and Schmidt (2000).",2017,

For this last classof spaces, we compute explicit expressions for the total bending whenthe unit vector field is the gradient field of the distance function toa point or to special totally geodesic submanifolds (i.e., for radialunit vector fields around this point or these submanifolds).",2003,Annals of Global Analysis and Geometry
Robust Reconstruction of Complex Networks from Sparse Data,"Reconstructing complex networks from measurable data is a fundamental problem for understanding and controlling collective dynamics of complex networked systems. However, a significant challenge arises when we attempt to decode structural information hidden in limited amounts of data accompanied by noise and in the presence of inaccessible nodes. Here, we develop a general framework for robust reconstruction of complex networks from sparse and noisy data. Specifically, we decompose the task of reconstructing the whole network into recovering local structures centered at each node. Thus, the natural sparsity of complex networks ensures a conversion from the local structure reconstruction into a sparse signal reconstruction problem that can be addressed by using the lasso, a convex optimization method. We apply our method to evolutionary games, transportation, and communication processes taking place in a variety of model and real complex networks, finding that universal high reconstruction accuracy can be achieved from sparse data in spite of noise in time series and missing data of partial nodes. Our approach opens new routes to the network reconstruction problem and has potential applications in a wide range of fields.",2015,Physical review letters
Regularization for Spatial Panel Time Series Using the Adaptive LASSO,"This paper proposes a model for estimating the underlying cross-sectional dependence structure of a large panel of time series. Technical difficulties meant such a structure is usually assumed before further analysis. We propose to estimate this by penalizing the elements in the spatial weight matrices using the adaptive LASSO proposed by Zou (2006). Non-asymptotic oracle inequalities and the asymptotic sign consistency of the estimators are proved when the dimension of the time series can be larger than the sample size, and they tend to infinity jointly. Asymptotic normality of the LASSO/adaptive LASSO estimator for the model regression parameter is also presented. All the proofs involve non-standard analysis of LASSO/adaptive LASSO estimators, since our model, albeit like a standard regression, always has the response vector as one of the covariates. A block coordinate descent algorithm is introduced, with simulations and a real data analysis carried out to demonstrate the performance of our estimators.",2014,
Joint Base Station Clustering and Beamformer Design for Partial Coordinated Transmission in Heterogeneous Networks,"We consider the interference management problem in a multicell MIMO heterogeneous network. Within each cell there is a large number of distributed micro/pico base stations (BSs) that can be potentially coordinated for joint transmission. To reduce coordination overhead, we consider user-centric BS clustering so that each user is served by only a small number of (potentially overlapping) BSs. Thus, given the channel state information, our objective is to jointly design the BS clustering and the linear beamformers for all BSs in the network. In this paper, we formulate this problem from a {sparse optimization} perspective, and propose an efficient algorithm that is based on iteratively solving a sequence of group LASSO problems. A novel feature of the proposed algorithm is that it performs BS clustering and beamformer design jointly rather than separately as is done in the existing approaches for partial coordinated transmission. Moreover, the cluster size can be controlled by adjusting a single penalty parameter in the nonsmooth regularized utility function. The convergence of the proposed algorithm (to a stationary solution) is guaranteed, and its effectiveness is demonstrated via extensive simulation.",2013,IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications
Smartlearn: Predicting learning performance and discovering smart learning strategies in flipped classroom,"In flipped classroom, students are expected to learn new contents in online learning system before attending offline classes to reinforce their knowledge. This online and offline blended education model has become more and more popular. However, spending more time to actively engage in online learning does not result in better learning performance, so that how to wisely arrange online learning plan is a big challenge. In this paper, we build a LASSO model to accurately predict students' performance in course projects and their final grade by online learning behaviour data in flipped classroom. The LASSO selected features show that learning online between first and second flipped classes after midnight, and during the second flipped class would benefit students' project performance but studying one day before the examination and studying at night is counterproductive. Our results provide novel insight into guiding students to learn wisely and perform better in flipped classroom.",2016,2016 International Conference on Orange Technologies (ICOT)
Regularized estimation of precision matrix for high-dimensional multivariate longitudinal data,"Abstract Estimating covariance matrix is one of the most important analytical tasks in analyzing multivariate longitudinal data, which provides a unique opportunity in studying the joint evolution of multiple response variables over time. This paper introduces a BiConvex Blockwise Regularization (BCBR) sparse estimator for the precision matrix (inverse of the covariance matrix) of high dimensional multivariate longitudinal responses. Using the modified Cholesky block decomposition, we impose a block banded structure on the Cholesky factor and sparsity on the innovation variance matrices via a novel convex hierarchical penalty and lasso penalty, respectively. The blockwise banding structure is a generalization of the existing banding structure for univariate longitudinal data. An efficient alternative convex optimization algorithm is developed by using ADMM algorithm. The resulting estimators are shown to converge in an optimal rate of Frobenius norm, and the exact bandwidth recovery is established for the precision matrix. Simulations and real-life data analysis show that the proposed estimator outperforms its competitors.",2020,J. Multivar. Anal.
A hybrid quasi-Newton projected-gradient method with application to Lasso and basis-pursuit denoising,"We propose a new algorithm for the optimization of convex functions over a polyhedral set in Rn. The algorithm extends the spectral projected-gradient method with limited-memory BFGS iterates restricted to the present face whenever possible. We prove convergence of the algorithm under suitable conditions and apply the algorithm to solve the Lasso problem, and consequently, the basis-pursuit denoise problem through the root-finding framework proposed by van den Berg and Friedlander [SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing, 31(2), 2008]. The algorithm is especially well suited to simple domains and could also be used to solve bound-constrained problems as well as problems restricted to the simplex.",2020,Math. Program. Comput.
Firm Characteristics and Expected Stock Returns,"Complementing the widely used conventional multiple regression approach â€” which can suffer from overfitting with a large number of predictors â€” we propose a combination Lasso (C-Lasso) approach to improve out-of-sample forecasts of cross-sectional expected stock returns via shrinkage. Using 99 firm characteristics and an out-of-sample period spanning more than four decades, an approach that blends conventional and C-Lasso forecasts delivers unbiased estimates of the cross-sectional dispersion in expected returns. Similarly, combining spread portfolios formed from conventional and C-Lasso forecasts generates substantial performance gains. Our results indicate that more characteristics matter for cross-sectional expected returns than previously believed, due to time-varying characteristic premia.",2019,

Activity Identification and Local Linear Convergence of Inertial Forward-Backward Splitting,"We consider the class of inertial Forward--Backward (iFB) proximal splitting algorithms, to minimize the sum of two proper lower semi-continuous convex functions, one of which having a Lipschitz continuous gradient and the other being partly smooth relative to an active manifold $\mathcal{M}$. Special cases of this class include the FB and, for an appropriate choice of the inertial parameter, FISTA-like schemes. We propose a unified analysis, under which we show that iFB-type splitting, (i) correctly identifies the active manifold $\mathcal{M}$ in a finite number of iterations, and then (ii) enters a local (linear) convergence regime, which is characterised precisely. This gives a grounded justification to the typical behaviour that has been observed numerically for many problems encompassed in our framework, including the Lasso, the group Lasso, total variation minimization and the nuclear norm regularization to name a few. These results may have numerous applications including in signal/image processing processing and machine learning.",2015,arXiv: Optimization and Control
A Gene-Related Nomogram for Preoperative Prediction of Lymph Node Metastasis in Colorectal Cancer.,"PURPOSE
To develop and validate a gene-related nomogram for predicting the risk of lymph node (LN) metastasis preoperatively in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC).


METHODS
RNA-seq data of 581 CRC and 51 normal cases with clinical features were downloaded from TCGA database. In the evaluation cohort with 381 CRC cases, the LASSO regression was used to reduce dimensionality of gene signatures extracted to build gene score. A gene-related nomogram was performed based on the multivariable logistic regression analysis. The performance of the nomogram was assessed by the discrimination, calibration, and clinical usefulness not only in the evaluation, but also in the validation cohort with 200 CRC cases.


RESULTS
A total of 12,590 differentially expressed genes were selected, in which 59 candidates associated with LN metastasis in differentially expressed genes set were screened by LASSO to form the gene score. Based on the analysis of multivariate logistic regression, the gene-related nomogram showed good calibration and discrimination not only in the evaluation cohort (concordance-index 0.93; 95%CI 0.91-0.96), but also in the validation cohort (concordance-index 0.70; 95%CI 0.63-0.78). The decision curve analysis of the gene-related nomogram also provides constructive guidance for the design of operation plan, preoperatively.


CONCLUSIONS
The presented genes nomogram may predict the LN metastasis in CRC patients, preoperatively. And 59 hub genes were defined related to LN metastasis of CRC, which can serve as treatment targets for the further study. Preoperative biopsy and gene analysis are needed to develop the operation plan in clinical practice.",2019,Journal of investigative surgery : the official journal of the Academy of Surgical Research
"Remanufactured circular mapping catheters: safety, effectiveness and cost","BackgroundThe use of remanufactured single-use devices (SUDs), including cardiac electrophysiology catheters, has become established in the USA and other health care systems but without much published scientific evaluation on the relative safety or efficacy of these devices. In the United Kingdom (UK), the use of remanufactured SUDs has not been routine. We performed a structured evaluation of the safety and efficacy of a remanufactured circular mapping catheter (StrykerÂ® remanufactured Lasso NAV 2515) during its introduction in our centre.MethodsWe prospectively evaluated the performance of a remanufactured circular mapping catheter in 100 consecutive patients undergoing an AF ablation. Operator feedback was obtained, assessing the device appearance, ease of use and function. As an indirect measurement of efficacy, acute procedure metrics were compared to those in 100 propensity-matched cases performed by the same operators using a new device. Cost savings were calculated.ResultsNo complication occurred in association with the remanufactured device. There was one reported failure of device malfunctionâ€”the flexion-extension mechanism of a remanufactured catheter and none in the matched-control group. There was satisfactory communication with the electro-anatomic mapping system. Ease of use of the remanufactured catheter was reported to be similar to a newly manufactured device. Procedural duration was similar with remanufactured devices and matched controls. With 100 cases using the remanufactured device, cost savings amounted to Â£30,444.ConclusionsThe use of remanufactured circular mapping catheters is safe, efficient and reliable. Widespread use of remanufactured SUDs offers the possibility of significant economic benefit.",2018,Journal of Interventional Cardiac Electrophysiology
"Diversidad, estructura y variaciÃ³n temporal del ensamble de peces asociados al arrecife coralino de Playa Mora, BahÃ­a de Tenacatita, MÃ©xico","This study describes the structure and temporal variation of fish assemblages associated with Playa Mora coral reef, Jalisco, Mexico. The species present were recorded with visual censuses along transects of 50 x 5 m, in three different seasons of the year (temperate-dry, warm-rainy, and warm-dry). A total of 5,689 fishes of 64 species were recorded. The best represented families according to species richness were Labridae (7) and Pomacentride (6). The biological value index determined that Thalassoma lucasanum, Stegastes acapulcoensis, Microspathodon dorsalis, and Prionurus punctatus were the dominant species. The fish assemblages by specific richness and trophic groups displayed temporal changes. The temperate-dry season presented the greatest richness and abundance of fish. The trophic category composition was mainly represented by carnivorous fish, which were dominant in the reef. The carnivorous, carnivorous-coralivores, obligate coralivores, herbivorous, zooplanktivorous, and parasitic species were better represented in the temperate-dry season, while the omnivores increased in the warm season.",2011,Hidrobiologica
Predrag MatvejeviÄ‡â€™s Mediterranean Breviary: Nostalgia for an â€œEx-Worldâ€ or Breviary for a New Community?,"Author(s): Botta, Anna | Abstract: In recent years, the declining importance of the nation-state and an increase in globalization have encouraged scholars to move towards the borderless world of seas and oceans, giving special attention to their diasporic movements of people and goods. Lately, this â€œnew thalassologyâ€ has witnessed an outburst of Mediterranean studies. Yet the resurgence of the Mediterranean in the postmodern, anti-nationalistic arena must be critically assessed. The risk in such studies is a reinforcing of old stereotypes, what the anthropologist Michael Herzfeld calls â€œMediterraneism.â€ The present article highlights the work of two scholars and one writer who alert us to the manifold dangers of Mediterraneism and who offer standpoints for launching a serious interrogation of Mediterraneism. Roberto Dainotto points to the asymmetries couched in the alluring metaphors of liquidity and flows. Iain Chambers views the Mediterranean as a space of solid borders that entail the production and consumption of the immigrant as outcast. The writer Predrag Matvejevic shows how Mediterranean identity cannot be understood as an all-encompassing unity, but as a satura, a discrete ensemble made up of differences and conflicts. By constructing a metonymical network of landscapes, things and crafts, and relying on the philological excavation of everyday words, his Mediterranean Breviary succeeds in asserting a humble communal identity against the clamor of wars and the retracing of borders.",2010,California Italian studies
Bayesian Joint Spike-and-Slab Graphical Lasso,"In this article, we propose a new class of priors for Bayesian inference with multiple Gaussian graphical models. We introduce fully Bayesian treatments of two popular procedures, the group graphical lasso and the fused graphical lasso, and extend them to a continuous spike-and-slab framework to allow self-adaptive shrinkage and model selection simultaneously. We develop an EM algorithm that performs fast and dynamic explorations of posterior modes. Our approach selects sparse models efficiently with substantially smaller bias than would be induced by alternative regularization procedures. The performance of the proposed methods are demonstrated through simulation and two real data examples.",2019,
An adaptive group lasso based multi-label regression approach for facial expression analysis,"In the realm of facial expression analysis, numerous attempts have been made to link each facial picture to one affective category. Nevertheless, in our daily life, few of the facial expressions are exactly one of the predefined affective states. Therefore, to analyze the facial expressions more effectively, this paper proposes an Adaptive Group Lasso based Multilabel Regression approach, which depicts each facial expression with multiple continuous values of predefined affective states. Adaptive Group Lasso is adopted to depict the relationship between different labels which different facial expressions share some same affective facial areas (patches). Moreover, to solve the multi-label regression problem, a convex optimization formulation is presented, which would guarantee a global optimal solution. The experiment results based on JAFFE dataset have verified the superior performance of our approach.",2014,2014 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)
On Bayesian lasso variable selection and the specification of the shrinkage parameter,"We propose a Bayesian implementation of the lasso regression that accomplishes both shrinkage and variable selection. We focus on the appropriate specification for the shrinkage parameter Î» through Bayes factors that evaluate the inclusion of each covariate in the model formulation. We associate this parameter with the values of Pearson and partial correlation at the limits between significance and insignificance as defined by Bayes factors. In this way, a meaningful interpretation of Î» is achieved that leads to a simple specification of this parameter. Moreover, we use these values to specify the parameters of a gamma hyperprior for Î». The parameters of the hyperprior are elicited such that appropriate levels of practical significance of the Pearson correlation are achieved and, at the same time, the prior support of Î» values that activate the Lindley-Bartlett paradox or lead to over-shrinkage of model coefficients is avoided. The proposed method is illustrated using two simulation studies and a real dataset. For the first simulation study, results for different prior values of Î» are presented as well as a detailed robustness analysis concerning the parameters of the hyperprior of Î». In all examples, detailed comparisons with a variety of ordinary and Bayesian lasso methods are presented.",2013,Statistics and Computing

Photo-realistic and detailed 3 D modeling : the Antonine nymphaeum at Sagalassos ( Turkey ) 1 PHOTO-REALISTIC AND DETAILED 3 D MODELING : THE ANTONINE NYMPHAEUM AT SAGALASSOS ( TURKEY ),"This paper gives a concise overview of the techniques we have used to build a detailed 3D model of the Antonine nymphaeum at the ancient city of Sagalassos (SW-Turkey). These include techniques for 3D acquisition, texture modelling and synthesis, data clean-up, and visualisation. The result was a maximally realistic but also veridical model, which proves that the technical possibilities are available to create this kind of detailed models. As such, we consider this paper as a plea to include the highest levels of detail into virtual models of archaeological buildings and landscapes where the data allow it. There is an ongoing debate whether high levels of detail, and photo-realistic visualisation for that matter, are desirable in the first place. Indeed, detailed models combined with photo-realistic rendering may convey an impression of reality, whereas they can never represent the situation like it really was. We agree that filling in completely hypothetical structures may be more misleading than it is informative. On the other hand, good indications about these structures, or even actual fragments thereof, are often available. Leaving out any structures one is not absolutely sure about, combining basic geometric primitives, or adopting copy-and-paste methods â€“ all aspects regularly found with simple model building â€“ also entail dangers. Such models will almost certainly fail to generate interest with the public. Moreover, it will fail to illustrate ornamental sophistication or shape and pattern irregularities, which can form a surplus value for the architectural and archaeological investigation of ancient buildings. Some examples of the research value of detailed virtual models are addressed in this paper.",2004,
A Bayesian approach with generalized ridge estimation for high-dimensional regression and testing,"ABSTRACT This paper adopts a Bayesian strategy for generalized ridge estimation for high-dimensional regression. We also consider significance testing based on the proposed estimator, which is useful for selecting regressors. Both theoretical and simulation studies show that the proposed estimator can simultaneously outperform the ordinary ridge estimator and the LSE in terms of the mean square error (MSE) criterion. The simulation study also demonstrates the competitive MSE performance of our proposal with the Lasso under sparse models. We demonstrate the method using the lung cancer data involving high-dimensional microarrays.",2017,Communications in Statistics - Simulation and Computation
Evaluation of Penalized Estimation Methods for Big Data Analysis,"In this paper we described the sparse Laplacian shrinkage (SLS) method which is a penalized method for variable selection and estimation in big data analysis that uses a combination of the minimax concave penalty (MCP) and Laplacian quadratic as the penalty. The SLS uses the MCP to promote sparsity and Laplacian quadratic penalty to encourage smoothness among coefficients associated with the correlated predictors. An important advantage of the MCP over the penalty is that it leads to estimators that are nearly unbiased and achieve selection consistency under weaker conditions. In some problems such as genomic data analysis, partial external information may also be available on the graphical structure of some genes used as predictors in the model. It would be interesting to consider approaches for combining external information on the graphical structure with existing data in constructing the Laplacian quadratic penalty. We discussed a comparative study with ridge regression (Ridge), Lasso, MCP and SLS estimator. For different sample and variable size, our simulation studies demonstrate that SLS estimator is the best estimator.

MPLasso: Inferring microbial association networks using prior microbial knowledge,"Due to the recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies, it becomes possible to directly analyze microbial communities in human body and environment. To understand how microbial communities adapt, develop, and interact with the human body and the surrounding environment, one of the fundamental challenges is to infer the interactions among different microbes. However, due to the compositional and high-dimensional nature of microbial data, statistical inference cannot offer reliable results. Consequently, new approaches that can accurately and robustly estimate the associations (putative interactions) among microbes are needed to analyze such compositional and high-dimensional data. We propose a novel framework called Microbial Prior Lasso (MPLasso) which integrates graph learning algorithm with microbial co-occurrences and associations obtained from scientific literature by using automated text mining. We show that MPLasso outperforms existing models in terms of accuracy, microbial network recovery rate, and reproducibility. Furthermore, the association networks we obtain from the Human Microbiome Project datasets show credible results when compared against laboratory data.",2017,PLoS Computational Biology

Methodology and effect of electrical isolation of pulmonary veins to treat persistent atrial fibrillation,"Objective To evaluate the feasibility and effectivity of pulmonary veins isolation ( PVI) to treat persistent atrial fibrillation ( AF) . Methods Fourteen patients with persistent AF lasting 1 week to 4 months were involved in this study. The history of AF were from 6 months to 20 years. The mean diameter of left atrium was 37 ~47(40. 8Â±26. 0)mm. The mean left ventricular ejection factor (LVEF) was 0. 55 ?. 11. Anticoagulant was applied for 2 ~ 3 weeks before operation. Coronary sinus catheter and right ventricular catheter were placed. Guided by Lasso catheter, four PVs were isolated at the outside of ostium with salt irrigated tip catheter using radiofrequency energy at power of 30 watts, 50â„ƒ. After recovery of sinus rhythm by cardiover-sion, remapping by Lasso catheter was performed and residual pulmonary vein potential ( PVP) were erased during sinus rhythm. Results Successful electrical isolation was obtained in 54 PVs including 14 left superior PVs, 13 left inferior PVs, 14 right superior PVs and 13 right inferior PVs. The success rate of PVI was 100%. The mean ablating duration was ( 2972Â±843 ) seconds. Pericardial effusion occurred in 1 patient. After follow-up of 12 ~ 15 months,5(36% ) patients were free of AF without any antiarrhythmic drugs,4(28% ) patients experienced remarkable reduction of AF episodes, and 5(36% ) patients had no improvement in symptom due to persistent atrial fibrillation. The total efficient rate was 64% . Conclusion Electrical isolation of pulmonary veins to treat persistent atrial fibrillation is efficient,and its method is feasible but has some limitation.",2006,Chinese Journal of Cardiac Arrhythmias
Marginal false discovery rate control for likelihood-based penalized regression models.,"The popularity of penalized regression in high-dimensional data analysis has led to a demand for new inferential tools for these models. False discovery rate control is widely used in high-dimensional hypothesis testing, but has only recently been considered in the context of penalized regression. Almost all of this work, however, has focused on lasso-penalized linear regression. In this paper, we derive a general method for controlling the marginal false discovery rate that can be applied to any penalized likelihood-based model, such as logistic regression and Cox regression. Our approach is fast, flexible and can be used with a variety of penalty functions including lasso, elastic net, MCP, and MNet. We derive theoretical results under which the proposed method is valid, and use simulation studies to demonstrate that the approach is reasonably robust, albeit slightly conservative, when these assumptions are violated. Despite being conservative, we show that our method often offers more power to select causally important features than existing approaches. Finally, the practical utility of the method is demonstrated on gene expression datasets with binary and time-to-eventÂ outcomes.",2019,Biometrical journal. Biometrische Zeitschrift
Consistent Cross-Validation for Tuning Parameter Selection in High-Dimensional Variable Selection,"Asymptotic behavior of tuning parameter selection in the standard cross-validation methods is investigated for the high-dimensional variable selection. It is shown that the shrinkage problem with LASSO penalty is not always the true reason for the overselection phenomenon in cross-validation based tuning parameter selection. After identifying the potential problems with the standard cross-validation methods, we propose a new procedure, Consistent Cross-Validation (CCV), for selecting the optimal tuning parameter. CCV is shown to enjoy the model selection consistency. Extensive simulations and real data analysis support the theoretical results and demonstrate that CCV also works well in terms of prediction.",2013,arXiv: Methodology
Zlog kot skladnja: MallarmÃ©jev Met kock,"Un Coup de des is one of the masterworks of modern literature, and a kind of summa of Stephane Mallarmeâ€™s lifework. It could not have been better served by writers and thinkers: on the one hand, it immediately transformed the field for working poets as different as Paul Valery and Christopher Brennan, as for so many more thereafter; on the other, a strong lineage of European philosophy registered the poem as an event for thought, encompassing Maurice Blanchot, J.-P. Sartre, Paul de Man, Jacques Derrida, Gilles Deleuze, Jacques Ranciere, Alain Badiou, J.-C. Milner, Quentin Meillassoux, and many others. Confronted by this sequence of commentaries by poets and philosophers, a contemporary reader could be forgiven for experiencing a methodological and intellectual impasse. How could one add to this sequence of readings except as a supernumerary number that could always be another?

High-Temperature Crystallographic Study of Mg-Doped TbAIO 3 and YAIO 3 BY,"The structures of Mg-doped TbAIO3 and YA103 have been examined by time-of-flight powder neutron diffraction at room temperature and at 573, 773, 1023 and 1223 K. For both compounds, at all temperatures, structural and anisotropic thermal parameters were refined in space group Pnma (No. 62) by full-profile Rietveld methods to weighted-profile R values of less than 0.042. The changes in difference nuclear densities, Ap, due to changes in temperature are illustrated by differencedensity maps around the atoms. The difference-density maps are constructed from Fobs, phased by Fcalc, and the high-temperature data are corrected by an isotropic temperature factor obtained locally around the atom in question. Ap is computed as Ap(low temperature) Ap(high temperature) with the coordinates of the atoms translated to the origin (0, 0, 0). The observed differencedensity distributions are described by mainly zerothand second-order spherical harmonics (quadrupolar functions), the natures of which vary between atomic sites. The difference-density maps provide a direct picture of the average in space and time of atomic thermal vibrations. These observations are less biased by the least-squares method than refined parameters. The nonspherical components to the atomic thermal vibrations are similar in Mg-doped TbA103 and YA103 but the absolute magnitude is significantly higher in TbAIO3. Introduction Considerable interest in AB03 perovskites stems from their variety of electrical and magnetic properties, for example ferroelectricity, as in BaTiO3 and related solid solutions. In recent years, other physical properties such as electrical and ionic conductivity and catalytic activity have been examined in great detail and have found use in several applications (Relier, 1993; Galasso, 1990), including solid-oxide fuel cells (Minh, 1993). In contrast to metal oxides like corundum, spinel or rutile, perovskite is not made up of a close-packed array of O anions with metal cations occupying interstitial * Present address: Rockwool International A/S, Hovedgaden 584, DK-2640 Hedehusene, Denmark. positions, but of an AO3 cubic close packing accommodating B cations in oxygen octahedral interstitials. This structural feature explains the ease with which the perovskite structure can accommodate large variations in metal--cation combinations and the ease with which oxygen movement may take place. Depending on the metal cations present, the physical properties vary within a large range of electrical, magnetic, piezoelectrical and dielectrical properties (Relier, 1993). In addition, many acceptor-doped perovskite oxides are known to possess high O-ion mobility, mainly because the mechanism of solid solution involves the creation of vacant 02sites in order to preserve electroneutrality. In the series of the rare-earth aluminates, the ionic conductivity is not high. Only at high temperatures, where the atoms have a lot of thermal energy, does the O-ion conductivity reach ,-,10S m -I for Mg-doped LaAIO3, which displays the highest conductivity in the series, and ,-.,0.1 S m -i for YA103, which has the lowest conductivity (Ranlcv, Mogensen & Poulsen, 1993). The large range in O-ion conductivity in this series is not readily explained. Kilner & Brook (1982) considered the path an O ion has to follow from one O site to another through a gap bordered by three cations, the critical radius, and found systematic trends in the size of this critical radius against the activation energy for O-ion migration. However, the differences are small compared to the mismatch between the ionic radius of an eight-coordinated O ion (,~, 1.4 A, following Shannon, 1976) and the critical radius, ~1 ~. Therefore, correlated thermal motions of the ions must play a part in allowing the oxygen migration to proceed. Correlations of atomic thermal motion cannot be derived from elastic scattering data, but information on the spaceand timeaveraged atomic thermal motion is obtainable and has contributed successfully to the understanding of the conduction mechanisms in several systems of cationic conductors (Cava, Reidinger & Wuensch, 1977; Schulz & Thiemann, 1979; Wuensch, 1993). In this study, we investigate detailed structural properties at ambient and high temperatures of two compounds of the rare-earth aluminate series: Tb[A10.95Mg0.05]O3_y (TAO) and Y[A10.95Mg0.05]O3-y (YAO). Criteria for this selection are the neutron scattering power and absorption Â© 1995 International Union of Crystallography Printed in Great Britain all rights reserved Journal of Applied Crystallography ISSN 0021-8898 Â© 1995 JENS RANLOV AND KURT NIELSEN 437 cross section of the constituent nuclei and the requirement of a wide span in the degree of orthorhombic distortion of the perovskite lattice compared to the aristotype cubic perovskite, TAO being the least and YAO the most distorted. We apply a direct method to synthesize nuclear difference densities between observations at different temperatures and from those we extract detailed information on atomic thermal displacements by resolving the observed density differences into spherical harmonics. The objective has been to apply the information obtained by these techniques to elucidate mechanisms leading to the significant differences in O-ion conductivity reported for the series of acceptor-doped rare-earth aluminates. Nuclear difference densities and spherical harmonics Essential information on inorganic ionic conductors has commonly been drawn from temperature-factor analyses of elastic scattering data (e.g. Cava et al., 1977; Schulz & Thiemann, 1979; Wuensch, 1993). Formalisms capable of providing an analytical description of scattering from atomic densities smeared by anharmonic vibration, positional disorder over closely spaced equilibrium sites or a combination thereof are described by Johnson & Levy (1974) and Willis & Pryor (1975). In the most commonly applied models, non-Gaussian terms are added to the Gaussian density description. However, such models involve a large number of parameters that may be reduced by the symmetry restrictions imposed by the atomic site symmetry. These models have successfully described anharmonic thermal displacements in structures of relatively high symmetry, like the Agion conductors (Wuensch, 1993) and Li3N (Schulz & Thiemann, 1979). Unfortunately, crystal-structure refinements including anharmonic contributions to thermal parameters for atoms on low-symmetry sites involve large numbers of refinable parameters, and are extremely elaborate to perform, especially from powder diffraction data. In addition, systematic errors from data collection and correlation with positional parameters affect the outcome. We have adopted a more direct method to elucidate changes with temperature in thermal displacements of the atoms by synthesizing nuclear difference-density maps, Ap, from the following: A p ( ~ ) : p l ( r ) -p 2 ( r ) = ~ [ ( F , f i /V l )exp( -Z:r i f l l "" ~) hkl (Fzh/Vz)Tf i2exp(-27r i f t2 . ~)].

The point-by-point difference, Ap, between nuclear densities of low-temperature and high-temperature observations is synthesized using observed structure factors, Fobs. F,,b.~ are extracted from the Rietveld refinement and have been phased by the calculated structure factors, Fcalc. The use of Fob~ has several advantages, for example a decrease in series-termination effects and systematic errors from measurements and refinements. The density maps were constructed for the individual atoms with the coordinates of the atom in question translated to the origin (0, 0, 0) and the scattering density normalized with respect to the scattering lengths of the individual atoms.

An Extragradient-Based Alternating Direction Method for Convex Minimization,"In this paper, we consider the problem of minimizing the sum of two convex functions subject to linear linking constraints. The classical alternating direction type methods usually assume that the two convex functions have relatively easy proximal mappings. However, many problems arising from statistics, image processing and other fields have the structure that while one of the two functions has an easy proximal mapping, the other function is smoothly convex but does not have an easy proximal mapping. Therefore, the classical alternating direction methods cannot be applied. To deal with the difficulty, we propose in this paper an alternating direction method based on extragradients. Under the assumption that the smooth function has a Lipschitz continuous gradient, we prove that the proposed method returns an $$\epsilon $$Ïµ-optimal solution within $$O(1/\epsilon )$$O(1/Ïµ) iterations. We apply the proposed method to solve a new statistical model called fused logistic regression. Our numerical experiments show that the proposed method performs very well when solving the test problems. We also test the performance of the proposed method through solving the lasso problem arising from statistics and compare the result with several existing efficient solvers for this problem; the results are very encouraging.",2017,Foundations of Computational Mathematics

Estimating Survival of Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients from Admission Information,"Background While clinical characteristics and a range of mortality risk factors of COVID-19 patients have been reported, a practical early clinical survival calculator specialized for the unique cohort of patients has not yet been introduced. Such a tool would provide timely and valuable guidance in clinical care decision-making during this global pandemic. Methods Demographic, laboratory, clinical, and treatment data (from 13 acute care facilities at Northwell Health) were extracted from electronic medical records and used to build and test the predictive accuracy of a survival probability calculator-the Northwell COVID-19 Survival (NOCOS) calculator-for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The NOCOS calculator was constructed using multivariate regression with L1 regularization (LASSO). Model predictive performance was measured using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the calculators tested. Results A total of 5,233 inpatients were included in the study. Patient age, serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN), Emergency Severity Index (ESI), red cell distribution width (RCDW), absolute neutrophil count, serum bicarbonate, and glucose were identified as the optimal early predictors of survival by multivariate LASSO regression. The predictive performance of the Northwell COVID-19 Survival (NOCOS) calculator was assessed for 14 consecutive days. Conclusions We present a rapidly developed and deployed estimate of survival probability that outperforms other general risk models. The 7 early predictors of in-hospital survival can help clinicians identify patients with increased probabilities of survival and provide critical decision support.",2020,
Sparse Logistic Regression for Text Categorization,"This paper studies regularized logistic regression and its application to text categorization. In particular we examine a Bayesian approach, lasso logistic regression, that simultaneously selects variables and provides regularization. We present an efficient training algorithm for this approach, and show that the resulting classifiers are both compact and have state-of-the-art effectiveness on a range of text categorization tasks.",2005,
Approaches to Regularized Regression - A Comparison between Gradient Boosting and the Lasso.,"BACKGROUND
Penalization and regularization techniques for statistical modeling have attracted increasing attention in biomedical research due to their advantages in the presence of high-dimensional data. A special focus lies on algorithms that incorporate automatic variable selection like the least absolute shrinkage operator (lasso) or statistical boosting techniques.


OBJECTIVES
Focusing on the linear regression framework, this article compares the two most-common techniques for this task, the lasso and gradient boosting, both from a methodological and a practical perspective.


METHODS
We describe these methods highlighting under which circumstances their results will coincide in low-dimensional settings. In addition, we carry out extensive simulation studies comparing the performance in settings with more predictors than observations and investigate multiple combinations of noise-to-signal ratio and number of true non-zero coeffcients. Finally, we examine the impact of different tuning methods on the results.


RESULTS
Both methods carry out penalization and variable selection for possibly highdimensional data, often resulting in very similar models. An advantage of the lasso is its faster run-time, a strength of the boosting concept is its modular nature, making it easy to extend to other regression settings.


CONCLUSIONS
Although following different strategies with respect to optimization and regularization, both methods imply similar constraints to the estimation problem leading to a comparable performance regarding prediction accuracy and variable selection in practice.",2016,Methods of information in medicine
