Fast Convex Pruning of Deep Neural Networks,"We develop a fast, tractable technique called Net-Trim for simplifying a trained neural network. The method is a convex post-processing module, which prunes (sparsifies) a trained network layer by layer, while preserving the internal responses. We present a comprehensive analysis of Net-Trim from both the algorithmic and sample complexity standpoints, centered on a fast, scalable convex optimization program. Our analysis includes consistency results between the initial and retrained models before and after Net-Trim application and guarantees on the number of training samples needed to discover a network that can be expressed using a certain number of nonzero terms. Specifically, if there is a set of weights that uses at most $s$ terms that can re-create the layer outputs from the layer inputs, we can find these weights from $\mathcal{O}(s\log N/s)$ samples, where $N$ is the input size. These theoretical results are similar to those for sparse regression using the Lasso, and our analysis uses some of the same recently-developed tools (namely recent results on the concentration of measure and convex analysis). Finally, we propose an algorithmic framework based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), which allows a fast and simple implementation of Net-Trim for network pruning and compression.",2020,ArXiv
Simultaneous nonparametric regression in RADWT dictionaries,"Abstract A new technique for nonparametric regression of multichannel signals is presented. The technique is based on the use of the Rational-Dilation Wavelet Transform (RADWT), equipped with a tunable Q-factor able to provide sparse representations of functions with different oscillations persistence. In particular, two different frames are obtained by two RADWT with different Q-factors that give sparse representations of functions with low and high resonance. It is assumed that the signals are measured simultaneously on several independent channels and that they share the low resonance component and the spectral characteristics of the high resonance component. Then, a regression analysis is performed by means of the grouped lasso penalty. Furthermore, a result of asymptotic optimality of the estimator is presented using reasonable assumptions and exploiting recent results on group-lasso like procedures. Numerical experiments show the performance of the proposed method in different synthetic scenarios as well as in a real case example for the analysis and joint detection of sleep spindles and K-complex events for multiple electroencephalogram (EEG) signals.",2019,Comput.

Measuring Systemic Risk with Network Connectivity: Extended Abstract,"Measuring connectedness among financial institutions is an important aspect of monitoring systemwide risk development and identifying systemically risky institutions. In this work, we present a novel statistical method for measuring connectivity among firms using publicly available time series of firm-level characteristics. The proposed method relies on a Lasso penalized estimation of high-dimensional vector autoregressive models (VAR) and provides a principled framework for estimating network topology of linkages among firms. We apply our method to analyze connectivity among stock returns of leading financial firms in the U.S. before, during and after the financial crisis of 2007-2009, and show that centrality measures of the estimated networks can be used to identify important systemic events and systemically risky institutions.",2016,

Variational Bayes Based Multiuser Detection for Onâ€“Off Random Access Channels,"This paper considers onâ€“off random access channels where the users transmit either a one or a zero to a base station or fusion center, and it is assumed that only a small fraction of users are active during any channel use. Under these assumptions, the problem of identifying the active users reduces to that of recovering a sparse binary vector from noisy random linear measurements. A hierarchical Bayesian approach is proposed in this paper to recover the set of active users. A fast approximate Bayesian inference based on Variational Bayes (VB) is then developed. Extensive simulation results are then provided to compare the performance of the proposed VB based Bayesian MUD approach to sparse estimation techniques such as OMP and LASSO. It is observed that the proposed approach is robust to variations in noise as well as sparsity levels. Further, for a given BER performance, the proposed approach requires substantially smaller dimensional codes as compared to OMP and LASSO, thus improving the spectral efficiency.",2018,Wireless Personal Communications
Arthur Guedel and the oropharyngeal airway.,"0 d ite block. The original airways were made of metal but this as liable to cause trauma to the teeth and soft tissues of the ips and tongue. Arthur Guedel designed an oropharyngeal irway made of rubber with a metal insert to reinforce the roximal portion and prevent obstruction, if the patient bit own on the tube. There was a phalange at the oral end to eep it in front of the patientâ€™s teeth and lips and prevent over nsertion. The curved portion of the tube conforms to the ontours of the oropharynx, while a central channel allows xchange of respiratory and anaesthetic gases and the passage f a suction catheter. Guedelâ€™s original paper describing this nduring piece of anaesthetic equipment was 14 lines of a half olumn in the Journal of theAmericanMedicalAssociation in 933 [1] (Fig. 1). Subsequent modifications have been made f plastic, but Guedelâ€™s principles remain and the eponymous the anatomical structure of the pharynx, this may partially or completely obstruct inspiration. It is usually remedied at once by the insertion of a pharyngeal airway which will hold the tongue forward from the pharyngeal wallâ€ [2]. One of Guedelâ€™s other major contributions was to standardise the clinical observations to estimate the depth of anaesthesia. These principles formed the core of his later text Inhalation Anesthesia: A Fundamental Guide first published in 1937 [2] with a second edition in 1951. The opening sentence of his book set the practical tone: â€œThis subject is treated concisely, avoiding confusing details, in order that the student may have a helpful picture to aid him in his early workâ€ [2]. The genesis of his observations was one of necessity during his service with the American Expeditionary Force in France during the latter part of the First World War. uedel airway has endured.

Activity-Aware Wearable System for Power-Efficient Prediction of Physiological Responses,"Wearable health monitoring has emerged as a promising solution to the growing need for remote health assessment and growing demand for personalized preventative care and wellness management. Vital signs can be monitored and alerts can be made when anomalies are detected, potentially improving patient outcomes. One major challenge for the use of wearable health devices is their energy efficiency and battery-lifetime, which motivates the recent efforts towards the development of self-powered wearable devices. This article proposes a method for context aware dynamic sensor selection for power optimized physiological prediction using multi-modal wearable data streams. We first cluster the data by physical activity using the accelerometer data, and then fit a group lasso model to each activity cluster. We find the optimal reduced set of groups of sensor features, in turn reducing power usage by duty cycling these and optimizing prediction accuracy. We show that using activity state-based contextual information increases accuracy while decreasing power usage. We also show that the reduced feature set can be used in other regression models increasing accuracy and decreasing energy burden. We demonstrate the potential reduction in power usage using a custom-designed multi-modal wearable system prototype.",2019,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)"

The efficiency of modified jackknife and ridge type regression estimators: a comparison.,"A common problem in multiple regression models is multicollinearity, which pro- duces undesirable eects on the least squares estimator. To circumvent this problem, two well known estimation procedures are often suggested in the literature. They are Generalized Ridge Regression (GRR) estimation suggested by Hoerl and Kennard (8) and the Jackknifed Ridge Regression (JRR) estimation suggested by Singh et al. (13). The GRR estimation leads to a reduction in the sampling variance, whereas, JRR leads to a reduction in the bias. In this paper, we propose a new estimator namely, Modied Jackknife Ridge Regression Estimator (MJR). It is based on the criterion that combines the ideas underlying both the GRR and JRR estimators. We have investigated standard properties of this new estimator. From a simulation study, we nd that the new estimator often outperforms the LASSO, and it is superior to both GRR and JRR estimators, using the mean squared error criterion. The conditions under which the MJR estimator is better than the other two competing estimators have been investigated. Full text",2008,
Prostate Cancer Classification Based on Gene Expression and Splicing Profiles,"The purpose of this study was to propose a method for classifying prostate cells into specific diagnostic categories based on their gene expression and exon in- clusion level and compare their performance in classification. In order to build a concise statistical model with meaningful biological information, we combining univariate analysis with multivariate analysis with lasso regularization for variable selection. Missing data is an important problem for exon inclusion level in our data. We apply two imputation methods and compare their results. Our ques- tions in concern were answered by error rates of 100 iterations of cross-validation in testing after training. We found: (1) Exon inclusion level has a much stronger prediction ability than gene expression on our data by making lower error rates (p-value=1.29e-11 for exon inclusion level imputed by median and 2.20e-16 for exon inclusion level imputed by KNN); (2) The model built on exon inclusion level is more concise with less variables than that built on gene expression (p- value=8.15e-6); (3) Imputation methods on exon inclusion level does not affect classification results (p-value=5.37e-1).",2015,
[Rhinoscleroma: two cases in Bobo-Dioulasso in Burkina Faso].,"INTRODUCTION
Rhinoscleroma is a chronic granulomatous infection of the respiratory tract due to Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis (K. rhinoscleromatis).


PATIENTS AND METHOD
We observed two cases of rhinoscleroma in the Souro-Sanou university hospital of Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso, over a 9-year period (2009 to 2010).


RESULTS
A 19-year-old man and a 38-year-old woman both consulted with obstructive granuloma of the nasal fossae; one also had a velar localization. The treatment consisted of surgical debridement and antibiotic therapy (ciprofloxacin). Good results followed the surgery. On follow-up after two and one and a half years, we observed no relapse.


CONCLUSION
The diagnosis of rhinoscleroma should be considered for any obstructive tumor of the nasal fossae. Histopathological examination contributes to the diagnosis.",2012,Medecine et sante tropicales

"Thalassodromeus sebesensis , an out of place and out of time Gondwanan tapejarid pterosaur","Abstract We report here the first occurrence of a small pterosaur, Thalassodromeus sebesensis from the Maastrichtian Hateg Island. This new species with its significantly expanded premaxillary crest extends the known distribution of this genus from South America to Europe. Furthermore, this important discovery doubles the thalassadromine fossil record and demonstrates a 42Â million years temporal displacement from its older Aptian Gondwanan congener Thalassodromeus sethi. T. sebesensis sp. nov. is diagnosed by an unusual expanded premaxillary crest and synapomorphies shared only with its Brazilian congener, T. sethi. Yet, the new specimen displays enough autapomorphic characters to erect a new thalassodromine species. The discovery of T. sebesensis in an exposure known for its diverse angiosperm assemblage lends more support to the tapejarid and flowering plants co-evolution. It also suggests this new small thalassadromine was a forest dweller, as such possibly not competing with the known giant azhdarchid pterosaurs on this island. Moreover, its presence in this insular ecosystem confirms once more the aberrant nature of the Late Cretaceous Hateg island-dwelling endemic fauna.",2015,Gondwana Research

Fast Bayesian model assessment for nonparametric additive regression,"Variable selection techniques for the classical linear regression model have been widely investigated. Variable selection in fully nonparametric and additive regression models has been studied more recently. A Bayesian approach for nonparametric additive regression models is considered, where the functions in the additive model are expanded in a B -spline basis and a multivariate Laplace prior is put on the coefficients. Posterior probabilities of models defined by selection of predictors in the working model are computed, using a Laplace approximation method. The prior times the likelihood is expanded around the posterior mode, which can be identified with the group LASSO, for which a fast computing algorithm exists. Thus Markov chain Monte-Carlo or any other time consuming sampling based methods are completely avoided, leading to quick assessment of various posterior model probabilities. This technique is applied to the high-dimensional situation where the number of parameters exceeds the number of observations.",2014,Comput. Stat. Data Anal.
Removable covered self-expanding metal stent for extraction of a large biliary stone in a patient on dual antiplatelet therapy.,"A 76-year-old man, who had previously undergone coronary artery bypass grafting but had episodes of myocardial infarction despite dual antiplatelet therapy, was diagnosed with a large common bile duct (CBD) stone that was causing recurrent cholangitis. Based on general agreement among the cardiologists and hematologists, his antiplatelet agents were neither stopped nor replaced with bridging medication. He underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) without biliary sphincterotomy 7 days prior to referral to our unit. His cholangitis was temporarily treated with a straight plastic stent passing alongside the stone; however, within 3 days of the procedure, the stent had migrated distally. The patient underwent a second ERCP with stent removal at our center. Given the constraints on performing a sphincterotomy, a 10Ã—60-mm fully covered selfexpanding metal stent (SEMS) with anchoring flaps (Hanarostent, M.I. Tech Co., Seoul; South Korea) was deployed across the papilla. An attempt to mobilize the stone with a Dormia basket failed, so the stone was subsequently dragged into the metal stent using a Fogarty balloon (â—"" Fig.1). The SEMS was easily invaginated from the proximal lasso and was removed with the CBD stone inside it (â—"" Video 1). Standard management for the extraction of bile duct stones involves ERCP with biliary sphincterotomy. In patients who are unsuitable for sphincterotomy [1] or young patients wishing to preserve the function of their sphincter of Oddi, endoscopic papillary balloon dilation could be an attractive alternative [2]. However, it is technically a risk factor for post-ERCP pancreatitis [3] and carries a potential risk of papillary bleeding related to the passage of the Dormia basket through the dilated papilla. SEMSs have been increasingly used to treat benign biliary strictures and bile leaks [4]. Recently, the use of SEMSs has been extended to complex biliary stones as a bridge to repeated attempts at extraction. Cerefice et al. [2], in a series of 36 patients, reported a clinical success rate of 83%, with an 11.1% stent migration rate. In this case, the SEMS allowed for gentle extraction of the stone, with only minor trauma to the papilla owing to invagination of the stent. Moreover, the anchoring flaps of the metal stent prevented it migrating distally as the stone was pulled into it with the Fogarty balloon. In patients receiving dual antiplatelet therapy that cannot be discontinued, the use of SEMSs for stones extraction may be an expensive but safe alternative.",2014,Endoscopy
Compressive Sensing for High-Resolution Direction-of-Arrival Estimation via Iterative Optimization on Sensing Matrix,"A novel compressive sensing- (CS-) based direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation algorithm is proposed to solve the performance degradation of the CS-based DOA estimation in the presence of sensing matrix mismatching. Firstly, a DOA sparse sensing model is set up in the presence of sensing matrix mismatching. Secondly, combining the Dantzig selector (DS) algorithm and least-absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm, a CS-based DOA estimation algorithm which performs iterative optimization alternatively on target angle information vector and sensing matrix mismatching error vector is proposed. The simulation result indicates that the proposed algorithm possesses higher angle resolution and estimation accuracy compared with conventional CS-based DOA estimation algorithms.",2015,International Journal of Antennas and Propagation
Long-term clay raw material selection and use in the region of Classical/Hellenistic to Early Byzantine Sagalassos (SW Turkey),"Abstract A provenance study was carried out on coarse ceramics from the Classical/Hellenistic to Mid-Byzantine city of Sagalassos, SW Turkey. The ceramics were sampled from the excavations of the city, and clay raw materials were sampled throughout its ancient territory. Used techniques were optical microscopy and electron microprobe analysis on thin sections, geochemical analysis (fusion ICP/MS and mineralogical analysis (X-ray diffraction). The geochemical/mineralogical diversity in the ceramics is not as wide as for the clay raw materials. It seems that even at the restricted scale of this study, the resources were limited to the area around the ancient site. The differences between the ceramics are likely due to the use of different ophiolitic clay bodies being exploited for their production.",2012,Journal of Archaeological Science
Psychological Distress is increasing among customer-facing retail employees: Evidence from 1997 to 2015,"Do customer-facing retail employees in the US have a higher prevalence of psychological distress? We examine psychological distress in a sample that includes 19,832 customer-facing retail employees from a sample of 1,115,280 employees of a cross-sectional National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) from 1997 through 2015. Our results show that customer-facing retail employees report significantly higher psychological distress than do employees in other industries and that its prevalence is increasing. These findings are consistent with mild and high levels of psychological distress. LASSO regression shows that, after self-reported health and poverty level, being a customer-facing retail employee is the third most important predictor of psychological distress.",2018,Journal of Business Research
Techniques for reducing air bubble intrusion into the left atrium during radiofrequency catheter and cryoballoon ablation procedures: An exÂ vivo study with a high-resolution camera.,"BACKGROUND
Air embolisms are serious complications during catheter ablation procedures.


OBJECTIVES
The aims of the present study were to determine when air bubbles enter the left atrium (LA) during catheter ablation procedures and to identify techniques that reduce air bubble intrusion.


METHODS
An exÂ vivo study was performed to monitor air bubbles using a silicone heart model and a high-resolution camera. In total, 280 radiofrequency catheter and cryoballoon ablation processes were tested.


RESULTS
Small and large air bubbles were often observed during catheter ablation processes. Many small air bubbles arose during sheath flushing at fast speeds (15 mL/2 s) (median bubble number [quartiles]: 35 [20-53] for SL0, 35 [23-44] for Agilis, and 98 [91-100] for FlexCath) and during initial cryoballoon inflation/freezing/deflation (34 [22-47]). Large (â‰¥1.5 mm) air bubbles were observed during Lasso catheter insertion (1 [0-1]), cryoballoon insertion (2Â [1-2]), and initial inflation/freezing/deflation (1 [1-3]). Massive air bubbles were observed during Optima catheter insertion into the sheath using an inserter (10 [2-15]). Sheath flushing at slow speeds (15 mL/5 s) significantly reduced the number of air bubbles. Before cryoballoon insertion, temporary balloon inflation and air bubble removal from the inflated surface were most effective in reducing air bubble intrusions. Optima catheter insertion without an inserter significantly reduced large air bubble intrusion.


CONCLUSION
Air bubbles entered the LA at specific times. Techniques such as sheath flushing at slow speeds, temporary cryoballoon inflation before insertion, inserting the Optima catheter without an inserter, and avoidance of negative pressure in the LA could reduce air bubble intrusion.",2019,Heart rhythm
The Generalized Group Lasso,"In this paper the Generalized Lasso model of R. Tibshirani is extended to consider multidimensional features (or groups of features) aÌ€ la Group Lasso, by substituting the â„“1 norm of the regularizer by the â„“2,1 norm. The resultant model is called Generalized Group Lasso (GenGL), and it contains as particular cases the already known Group Lasso and Group Fused Lasso (GFL), but also new models as the Graph-Guided Group Fused Lasso, or the trend filtering for multidimensional features. We show how to solve them efficiently combining FISTA iterations with the Proximal Operator of the corresponding regularizer, which we compute using a dual formulation. Moreover, GenGL makes possible to introduce a new approach to Group Total Variation, the regularizer of GFL, that results in a training much faster than that of previous methods.",2015,2015 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)

Identifying joint biomarker panel from multiple level dataset by an optimization model.,"AIM
Joint biomarker panel takes advantage of coherence across multiple level datasets and holds the promise to improve disease diagnosis accuracy.


METHODS
We collected 101 colorectal cancer and 95 benign samples, measured the molecular concentrations by serum assays and mass spectra, and developed LPGLO (Linear Programming based on Group Lasso Optimization) to identify the joint biomarker panel.


RESULTS
A joint biomarker panel, with ten serum biomarkers and six mass spectra peaks, achieves LOOCV accuracy 0.8724, which is better than the optimal panels identified from separate datasets (LOOCV = 0.7551 for mass spectra only or 0.8265 for serum assay only) and the simply merged dataset (LOOCV = 0.8622).


CONCLUSION
LPGLO is useful to identify joint biomarker panel to help tumor diagnosis.",2016,Biomarkers in medicine
Assessing Robustness of Regularized Regression Models with Applications,"In this Big-data and computational innovation era, advanced level analysis and modelling strategies are essential in data science to understanding the individual activities which occur within very complex behavioral, socio-economic and ecological systems. However, the scales at which models can be developed, and the subsequent problems they can inform, are often limited by our inability or challenges to effectively understand data that mimic interactions at the finest spatial, temporal, or organizational resolutions. Linear regression analysis is the one of the widely used methods for investigating such relationship between variables. Multicollinearity is one of the major problem in regression analysis. Multicollinearity can be reduced by using the appropriate regularized regression methods. This study aims to measure the robustness of regularized regression models such as ridge and Lasso type models designed for the high dimensional data having the multicollinearity problems. Empirical results show that Lasso and Ridge models have less residual sum of squares values. Findings also demonstrate an improved accuracy of estimated parameters on the best model.",2019,
Development and temporal validation of a prognostic model for 1-year clinical outcome after decompression surgery for lumbar disc herniation,"Surgeons need tools to provide individualised estimates of surgical outcomes and the uncertainty surrounding these, to convey realistic expectations to the patient. This study developed and validated prognostic models for patients undergoing surgical treatment of lumbar disc herniation, to predict outcomes 1 year after surgery, and implemented these models in an online prediction tool. Using the data of 1244 patients from a large spine unit, LASSO and linear regression models were fitted with 90% upper prediction limits, to predict scores on the Core Outcome Measures Index, and back and leg pain. Candidate predictors included sociodemographic factors, baseline symptoms, medical history, and surgeon characteristics. Temporal validation was conducted on 364 more recent patients at the same unit, by examining the proportion of observed outcomes exceeding the threshold of the 90% upper prediction limit (UPL), and by calculating mean bias and other calibration measures. Poorer outcome was predicted by obesity, previous spine surgery, and having basic obligatory (rather than private) insurance. In the validation data, fewer than 12% of outcomes were above the 90% UPL. Calibration plots for the model validation showed values for mean biasâ€‰<â€‰0.5 score points and regression slopes close to 1. While the model accuracy was good overall, the prediction intervals indicated considerable predictive uncertainty on the individual level. Implementation studies will assess the clinical usefulness of the online tool. Updating the models with additional predictors may improve the accuracy and precision of outcome predictions.

Fatty acid composition indicating diverse habitat use in coral reef fishes in the Malaysian South China Sea,"BackgroundIn order to understand feeding ecology and habitat use of coral reef fish, fatty acid composition was examined in five coral reef fishes, Thalassoma lunare, Lutjanus lutjanus, Abudefduf bengalensis, Scarus rivulatus and Scolopsis affinis collected in the Bidong Island of Malaysian South China Sea.ResultsProportions of saturated fatty acids (SAFA) ranged 57.2% 74.2%, with the highest proportions in fatty acids, the second highest was monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) ranged from 21.4% to 39.0% and the proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) was the lowest ranged from 2.8% to 14.1%. Each fatty acid composition differed among fishes, suggesting diverse feeding ecology, habitat use and migration during the fishesâ€™ life history in the coral reef habitats.ConclusionsDiets of the coral fish species might vary among species in spite of that each species are living sympatrically. Differences in fatty acid profiles might not just be considered with respect to the diets, but might be based on the habitat and migration.",2015,Biological Research
Predicting clinical variables from neuroimages using fused sparse group lasso,"Predictive models in which neuroimage features serve as predictors and a clinical variable is modeled as the outcome are good candidates for clinical application because (1) they can exploit dependencies between predictor variables and thus potentially explain more variability in the outcome than a mass univariate approach, and (2) they allow inference at the individual level, such that a prediction can be obtained for a new individual whose data was not used to train the model. This dissertation proposes methods for neuroimaging prediction models that not only aim for predictive accuracy, but also seek interpretability and potential insight into the underlying pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders. 
 
In the first part of this dissertation we propose the fused sparse group lasso penalty, which encourages structured, sparse, interpretable solutions by incorporating prior information about spatial and group structure among voxels. We derive optimization steps for fused sparse group lasso penalized regression using the alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm. With simulation studies, we demonstrate conditions under which fusion and group penalties together outperform either of them alone. We then use fused sparse group lasso to predict continuous measures from resting state magnetic resonance imaging data using the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange dataset. In the second part of this dissertation we use fused sparse group lasso to predict age from multimodal neuroimaging data in a sample of cognitively normal adults aged 65 and older. In general, we show how the incorporation of prior information via the fused sparse group lasso penalty can enhance the interpretability of neuroimaging predictive models while also yielding good predictive performance. 
 
Public health significance: Psychiatric disorders and neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's present a large public health burden. As of yet, there have been relatively few translations of basic neuroscience findings to clinical applications in psychiatry. Prediction models using neuroimaging data can potentially help clinicians with diagnosis and prediction of prognosis and treatment response. Establishing interpretable neuroimaging-based biomarkers can improve our understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying neuropsychiatric disorders and suggest approaches for prevention and treatment.",2018,
Knowledge Specialization in PhD Student Groups âˆ—,"Researchers have argued that specialization within groups yields productivity gains. We evaluate this statement with a focus on groups of PhD students. Using an established technique in computer science called Latent Dirichlet Allocation, we construct a novel measure of the dispersion of PhD studentsâ€™ research interests based on their dissertation abstracts. We then relate this measure to PhD group publications. For our study, we use a rich dataset on groups of PhD students who studied at a major Swiss university, during the 1993-2008 period. We find robust evidence that within-group knowledge specialization is associated with a larger number of publications. However, when specialization increases beyond a critical level, it hinders the groupâ€™s publication output. We interpret these results as an indication that gains, in the amount of research output, can be achieved if PhD students specialize according to their comparative advantages. However, beyond a certain level, knowledge specialization has a detrimental impact on research output, due to increasing communication costs and an increased likelihood of conflict insurgence. Managerial relevance statement: Our study makes an important contribution to understanding the implications of within-group knowledge specialization on the productivity of knowledge-intensive groups. We argue that knowledge specialization generates benefits to a research group in terms of increased output because it allows the group members to specialize in those research areas for which they have a comparative advantage. However, knowledge specialization also involves communication costs and favors the insurgence of conflicts among group members. Hence, when the head of a research group sets the optimal level of knowledge specialization for her group, she has to solve a âˆ—We are indebted to Paula Stephan, Peter Thompson, Marie Thursby, Jerry Thursby, and two anonymous reviewers for insightful comments and suggestions.

New synonymy between Philopterus antarcticus and Saemundssonia nivea (Phthiraptera: Philopteridae),"Abstract A new synonymy is proposed between Philopterus antarcticus Wood, 1937 and Saemundssonia nivea Timmermann, 1956 (both with type host Pagodroma nivea (Forster, 1777)). It is based on the examination and comparison of the type specimens of both nominal species, as well as several additional samples of Saemundssonia lice from Pagodroma nivea and Thalassoica antarctica (Gmelin, 1789). The present status of the senior synonym is Saemundssonia (Saemundssonia) antarctica (Wood, 1937).",1994,New Zealand Journal of Zoology
Malnutrition in HIV-Infected Children Is an Indicator of Severe Disease with an Impaired Response to Antiretroviral Therapy,"This observational study aimed to describe immunopathogenesis and treatment outcomes in children with and without severe acute malnutrition (SAM) and HIV-infection. We studied markers of microbial translocation (16sDNA), intestinal damage (iFABP), monocyte activation (sCD14), T-cell activation (CD38, HLA-DR) and immune exhaustion (PD1) in 32 HIV-infected children with and 41 HIV-infected children without SAM prior to initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and cross-sectionally compared these children to 15 HIV-uninfected children with and 19 HIV-uninfected children without SAM. We then prospectively measured these markers and correlated them to treatment outcomes in the HIV-infected children at 48 weeks following initiation of ART. Plasma levels of 16sDNA, iFABP and sCD14 were measured by quantitative real time PCR, ELISA and Luminex, respectively. T cell phenotype markers were measured by flow cytometry. Multiple regression analysis was performed using generalized linear models (GLMs) and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) approach for variable selection. Microbial translocation, T cell activation and exhaustion were increased in HIV-uninfected children with SAM compared to HIV-uninfected children without SAM. In HIV-infected children microbial translocation, immune activation, and exhaustion was strongly increased but did not differ by SAM-status. SAM was associated with increased mortality rates early after ART initiation. Malnutrition, age, microbial translocation, monocyte, and CD8 T cell activation were independently associated with decreased rates of CD4% immune recovery after 48 weeks of ART. SAM is associated with increased microbial translocation, immune activation, and immune exhaustion in HIV-uninfected children and with worse prognosis and impaired immune recovery in HIV-infected children on ART.",2018,AIDS Research and Human Retroviruses
Comment on article by Polson and Scott,"Polson and Scottâ€™s paper presents the enlightening observation that the standard SVM can be embedded into a statistical latent variable model. This is aligned with other recent work, in which the penalty term in the convex optimization for several popular non-Bayesian models has been replaced by a prior distribution in order to develop an alternative Bayesian approach. See, for example, the Bayesian lasso model by Park and Casella (2008) and Hans (2009), and the Bayesian bridge regression model by Armagan (2009). Following the work of Andrews and Mallows (1974) and West (1987), the prior distributions used in these methods are expressed as scale mixtures of normal distributions. For example, in bridge regression (Frank and Friedman 1993), which includes both ridge regression (Hoerl and Kennard 1970) and lasso (Tibshirani 1996) as special cases, the regression parameters are estimated by minimizing the penalized residual sum of squares (using centered data),",2011,Bayesian Analysis
Etude de la qualitÃ© physico-chimique et biologique des eaux du fleuve Niger Ã  Niamey,"Le fleuve Niger est le recepteur principal des rejets dâ€™eaux usees de la ville de Niamey, capital du Niger, provenant des activites industrielles, domestiques, hospitalieres et agricoles.

Or, les eaux du fleuve sont utilisees entre autres pour lâ€™alimentation en eau potable de Niamey et pour lâ€™agriculture irriguee. Les eaux souterraines qui alimentent le fleuve Niger, se degradent au fil des annees au voisinage de Niamey a cause de lâ€™infiltration des eaux issues de la pollution urbaine ainsi que des latrines et fosses sceptiques.

"Guerra Racial e NaÃ§Ã£o na Gran ColÃ´mbia caribenha, Cartagena, 1810-1832","Enquanto que a maioria dos historiadores remete a origem das atuais relacoes raciais a escravidao colonial, Marixa Lasso argumenta que foi durante a Era das Revolucoes das lutas anticoloniais americanas que nacoes com historias semelhantes de colonialismo, escravidao e racismo desenvolveram distintos imaginarios raciais modernos. Em particular, examina-se a origem da ideologia nacionalista de igualdade e harmonia racial (o mito da democracia racial, conforme a denominacao do seculo XIX), durante as guerras de independencia hispano-americanas. Sua analise enfoca a Gran Colombia, uma das regioes-chave na luta pela independencia hispano-americana, onde a guerra transformou o imaginario racial de duas maneiras. A guerra propiciou a ideia de igualdade racial unindo a forca emocional do patriotismo, transformando-a numa ideologia nacionalista que transcendia diferencas partidarias e regionais. Ao mesmo tempo, o fantasma de outro tipo de guerra, a â€œguerra de racasâ€, criou diferencas fundamentais entre o que se constituia como um discurso racial legitimo e um discurso racial ilegitimo. O medo da guerra de racas restringiu as acoes politicas dos afro-descendentes e limitou suas oportunidades para denunciar a permanencia de persistentes preconceitos e padroes de discriminacoes informais.",2010,Estudos Ibero-americanos
Essays in volatility estimation based on high frequency data,"Based on high-frequency price data, this thesis focuses on estimating the realized covariance and the integrated volatility of asset prices, and applying volatility estimation to price jump detection. The first chapter uses the LASSO procedure to regularize some estimators of high dimensional realized covariance matrices. We establish theoretical properties of the regularized estimators that show its estimation precision and the probability that they correctly reveal the network structure of the assets. The second chapter proposes a novel estimator of the integrated volatility which is the quadratic variation of the continuous part in the price process. This estimator is obtained by truncating the two-scales realized variance estimator. We show its consistency in the presence of market microstructure noise and finite or infinite activity jumps in the price process. The third chapter employs this estimator to design a test to explore the existence of price jumps with noisy price data. Basandonos en datos de precios de alta frecuencia, esta tesis se centra en la estimacion de la covarianza realizada y la volatilidad integrada de precios de activos, y la aplicacion de la estimacion de la volatilidad para la deteccion de saltos en los precios. El primer capitulo utiliza el procedimiento LASSO para regularizar algunos estimadores de matrices de covarianza realizada de alta dimension. Establecemos propiedades teoricas de los estimadores regularizados que muestran su precision de estimacion y la probabilidad de que revelen correctamente la estructura de red de los activos. En el segundo capitulo se propone un nuevo estimador de la volatilidad integrada que es la variacion cuadratica de la parte continua en el proceso de precios. Este estimador se obtiene truncando el estimador de varianza realizado en dos escalas. Demostramos su consistencia en presencia de ruido de microestructura del mercado y saltos de actividad finitos o infinitos en el proceso de precios.

"Stratigraphy and paleoenvironment of the Quemo Co Formation in Shengli River area,northern Tibet","Recently abundant silicified wood was discovered in the Quemo Co Formation along the Shengli River section in Shengli River area,northern Tibet.In addition,certain amounts of bivalves(e.g.,Astarte delicata Fan,A.cf.voltzii Goldfuss,Pleuromya sp.,Protocardia sp.,Modiolus sp.,Neomiodon sp.,and Chlamys sp.),spores and pollen grains(e.g.,Cyathidites,Deltoidospora,Neoraistrickia and Classopallis) were also found in this section.A detailed investigation along the section was performed to reconstruct the paleoenvironment during Quemo Co deposition.The magma emplacement age of the Nadi Kangri volcanic rocks underlying the Quemo Co Formation is ca.205-220 Ma,representing the early sedimentary age of the Quemo Co Formation.The Quemo Co strata are overlain conformably by the middle Jurassic Buqu strata.Therefore,the sedimentary age of the Quemo Co Formation should be early-middle Jurassic.The Quem Co Formation is composed chiefly of quartz sandstone and conglomerate intercalated with minor micritic limestone.The basal units are typically conglomeratic with the characteristics of alluvial and fluvial sedimentation.These units are overlain by quartz sandstone intercalated with micritic limestone containing salt,brackish and fresh water bivalve fossils,thus considered to be a delta environment.Subsequently,these strata were overlain by restricted platform limestone,indicating a progradational sequence of transition from continental to marine facies.The composition of palynofloras from Quemo Co strata suggests that the climate of the Shengli River region belonged to a sub-humid tropical to sub-tropical zone during the deposition of silicified wood.",2010,Geology in China
Estimating TTC for wind farm integrated power systems based on nonparametric regression analytics,"Assessing security margin of operation is vital in situation awareness for power systems with centralized wind farm integration. Total transfer capability (TTC) can be used as an indicator referring to the maximal loadability of transmission corridors. However, the calculation of TTC considering wind generation is a computation-intensive procedure. In order to assess TTC, an estimation approach based on nonparametric regression analytics is presented which takes into account clustering, feature confirmation, samples generation and group Lasso regression modeling. The estimated result is comparable to the performance of conventional techniques such as artificial neural network (ANN). However, the novelty of this approach lies in that it provides explicit spline functions showing the correlation between the selected features and the TTC value. In addition, the spline expression for every single feature against TTC is obtained, revealing highly nonlinear sensitivity of the related parameters. A numerical example is presented using the modified New England 39-bus test system.",2016,2016 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting (PESGM)

The Geometry of Sparse Analysis Regularization,"Analysis sparsity is a common prior in inverse problem or machine learning including special cases such as Total Variation regularization, Edge Lasso and Fused Lasso. We study the geometry of the solution set (a polyhedron) of the analysis l1-regularization (with l2 data fidelity term) when it is not reduced to a singleton without any assumption of the analysis dictionary nor the degradation operator. In contrast with most theoretical work, we do not focus on giving uniqueness and/or stability results, but rather describe a worst-case scenario where the solution set can be big in terms of dimension. Leveraging a fine analysis of the sub-level set of the regularizer itself, we draw a connection between support of a solution and the minimal face containing it, and in particular prove that extremal points can be recovered thanks to an algebraic test. Moreover, we draw a connection between the sign pattern of a solution and the ambient dimension of the smallest face containing it. Finally, we show that any arbitrary sub-polyhedra of the level set can be seen as a solution set of sparse analysis regularization with explicit parameters.",2019,arXiv: Optimization and Control
Composite quantile regression and variable selection of the partial linear single-index models,"In this paper, we propose a composite minimizing average check loss estimation(CMACLE)method for the composite quantile regression(CQR)of the partial linear single-index model(PLSIM)by local linear method. Based on constructive approach, the estimators by CMACLE are able to achieve the best convergence rate. The asymptotical normalities of the estimators are also derived. Meanwhile, the asymptotic efficiency of the CQR estimation relative to the mean regression are investigated. Further more, we propose a variable selection method for the CQR of PLSIM by combining the CMACLE procedure with the adaptive LASSO penalized method. The oracle properties of the proposed variable selection method are also established. Simulations with various non-normal errors and a real data analysis are conducted to assess the finite sample property of the proposed estimation and variable selection methods.",2014,

"La stazione San Pasquale della metropolitana di Napoli. Costruzione, monitoraggio ed analisi dei comportamenti osservati.","Il tema trattato nel presente lavoro di tesi riguarda il comportamento di scavi profondi a cielo aperto sotto falda in zone densamente urbanizzate. 
Negli ultimi decenni la tendenza a recuperare gli spazi sotterranei nelle citta ormai sature di costruzioni rende lâ€™argomento di grande attualita e oggetto di dibattito allâ€™interno della comunita scientifica nazionale e internazionale. 
Lâ€™incremento demografico delle grandi citta comporta problemi di traffico e di inquinamento, cio spinge le pubbliche amministrazioni a potenziare i trasporti pubblici ampliando e/o creando nuove linee metropolitane. Affinche il trasporto su gomma venga disincentivato e la qualita di vita nelle citta affollate subisca dei benefici e indispensabile che le stazioni si trovino in una posizione baricentrica rispetto alle zone di maggiore affollamento, vicino a edifici civili e monumenti.
La comprensione dei meccanismi deformativi degli scavi e delle opere di sostegno, la loro interazione con il tessuto urbano circostante e le capacita previsionali del comportamento di tali opere diventano cruciali per condizionarne la fattibilita o incidere in maniera significativa sui tempi e sui costi di realizzazione.
Il lavoro di ricerca qui presentato cerca di portare un contributo sia riguardo alla comprensione del comportamento di grandi scavi a cielo aperto sia alla valutazione della capacita previsionale degli strumenti di analisi attualmente disponibili, prestando molta attenzione anche ad aspetti tecnologici in grado di giocare un ruolo non trascurabile. La tesi documenta in maniera accurata la case history completa relativa allâ€™esecuzione della stazione metropolitana San Pasquale a Napoli dedotta da una meticolosa attivita di monitoraggio, relazioni di cantiere e visite tecniche. In particolare vengono descritti in maniera dettagliata il progetto della stazione, la sequenza costruttiva e le informazioni ottenute dalle diverse indagini in situ e in laboratorio.
Particolare interesse e stato dedicato ai meccanismi deformativi delle strutture a sostegno dello scavo e del terreno circostante indotti dalle lavorazioni; questi infatti potrebbero causare cedimenti, rotazioni e distorsioni in grado di comportare gravi danni agli edifici limitrofi anche fino al collasso.

Haptics-Assisted 3 D Lasso Drawing for Tracts-of-interest Selection in DTI Visualization,"We present a new haptics-assisted 3D lasso drawing interface for selecting tracts-of-interest (TOI) in diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in fishtank virtual reality (VR). This interface brings TOI selection tasks into 3D stereo VR with higher-input bandwidth devices. In the system, the 6D input Phantom device lets the user make selections by drawing a smooth 3D lasso with haptics constraint assistance directly in the 3D space. The hand tracker lets the user use hand gestures to rotate and zoom the model. Users also reported that making selections by drawing 3D lassos is easy, as it resembles pointing out structures to a collaborator with their fingers but has higher precision. Users also remarked that VR helped them appreciate the three-dimensional structure of the fiber tracts more easily, and they gained more confidence in identifying the structures and the area they project in the brain. Working in the VR environment reduces the navigation time of the TOI selection task, a key challenge in TOI selection tools. Users were able to segment out tortuous structures that are often time-consuming to select using traditional rigidly shaped volume-of-interest (VOI) fiber pathway selection tools.",2008,
The significance of endo-ultrasonography in the preoperative management of patients with (early) pancreatic cancer,"s / Pancreatology 526 Objectives. Alcohol is a risk factor for acute pancreatitis. In our previous two year follow up abstinence protected for recurrences. Our aim was to further determine recurrence of pancreatitis and later pancreatic function in patients who quit drinking after the first episode of alcoholassociated pancreatitis. Materials andmethods: Out of the total of 120 patients with their first alcohol-associated pancreatitis, 23 (20 M, 3 F; age median 47 (27â€“60) years) met the inclusion criteria for abstinence during the follow up. The criteria for abstinence were alcohol consumption less than 24 grams per twomonths (self-estimated) which is in line with questionnaires detecting alcohol consumption and dependency (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, AUDIT < 8 and Short Alcohol Dependence Data, SADD < 9). Recurrent attacks of acute pancreatitis were studied. Smoking, body-mass index and laboratory tests detecting heavy use of alcohol were recorded. Blood and fecal tests were studied to assess endocrine and exocrine pancreatic function. Results: During a mean follow up time of 4.8 (2â€“9) years and total of 111 patient years therewere no recurrent attacks of acute pancreatitis. Two patients had diabetes prior to and two just after the first episode of acute pancreatitis. One patient demonstrated new onset diabetes during the follow up at 1.5 years. One patient showed low elastase activity at 2 and another at 3 years, but no-one later on. Conclusions: Abstinence after the first acute alcohol-associated pancreatitis protects from recurrent attacks and seems to decrease the risk for pancreatic dysfunction.",2012,Pancreatology

"One-carbon metabolism, cognitive impairment and CSF measures of Alzheimer pathology: homocysteine and beyond","BackgroundHyperhomocysteinemia is a risk factor for cognitive decline and dementia, including Alzheimer disease (AD). Homocysteine (Hcy) is a sulfur-containing amino acid and metabolite of the methionine pathway. The interrelated methionine, purine, and thymidylate cycles constitute the one-carbon metabolism that plays a critical role in the synthesis of DNA, neurotransmitters, phospholipids, and myelin. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that one-carbon metabolites beyond Hcy are relevant to cognitive function and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measures of AD pathology in older adults.MethodsCross-sectional analysis was performed on matched CSF and plasma collected from 120 older community-dwelling adults with (nâ€‰=â€‰72) or without (nâ€‰=â€‰48) cognitive impairment. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was performed to quantify one-carbon metabolites and their cofactors. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was initially applied to clinical and biomarker measures that generate the highest diagnostic accuracy of a priori-defined cognitive impairment (Clinical Dementia Rating-based) and AD pathology (i.e., CSF tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 [p-tau181]/Î²-Amyloid 1â€“42 peptide chain [AÎ²1â€“42] >0.0779) to establish a reference benchmark. Two other LASSO-determined models were generated that included the one-carbon metabolites in CSF and then plasma. Correlations of CSF and plasma one-carbon metabolites with CSF amyloid and tau were explored. LASSO-determined models were stratified by apolipoprotein E (APOE) Îµ4 carrier status.ResultsThe diagnostic accuracy of cognitive impairment for the reference model was 80.8% and included age, years of education, AÎ²1â€“42, tau, and p-tau181. A model including CSF cystathionine, methionine, S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH), S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), serine, cysteine, and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF) improved the diagnostic accuracy to 87.4%. A second model derived from plasma included cystathionine, glycine, methionine, SAH, SAM, serine, cysteine, and Hcy and reached a diagnostic accuracy of 87.5%. CSF SAH and 5-MTHF were associated with CSF tau and p-tau181. Plasma one-carbon metabolites were able to diagnose subjects with a positive CSF profile of AD pathology in APOE Îµ4 carriers.ConclusionsWe observed significant improvements in the prediction of cognitive impairment by adding one-carbon metabolites. This is partially explained by associations with CSF tau and p-tau181, suggesting a role for one-carbon metabolism in the aggregation of tau and neuronal injury. These metabolites may be particularly critical in APOE Îµ4 carriers.",2017,Alzheimer's Research & Therapy
"Local production of IgG and IgG subclasses in the aqueous humor of patients with Fuchs heterochromic cyclitis, herpetic uveitis and toxoplasmic chorioretinitis","Changes in local immunity are important whenconsidering the physiopathology of uveitis. The aim ofthis study was to measure IgG and IgG subclassconcentrations in the serum and the AH of patients withthree different types of uveitis and to determine for eachof them the presence of a local production of IgG in theintra-ocular compartment. This investigation was extendedto IgG subclasses.Serum and AH of 46 patients, including 11 with Fuchsheterochromic cyclitis (FHC), 13 with toxoplasmicchorioretinitis, 11 with herpetic uveitis and 11 with senilecataract (taken as controls) were analyzed by ELISA forIgG and IgG subclasses. Three quotients (r1, IgG/albuminin serum; r2, IgG/albumin in AH; and R, r2/r1) werecalculated in order to estimate the local synthesis (LS) ofIgG and each IgG subclass.In AH of patients with herpetic uveitis, a concomitant andsignificant increase of all IgG subclasses as well asalbumin (with no significant increase of r2 or R) wasobserved. This finding was interpreted as an indirectconsequence of major damage to the bloodâ€“aqueousbarrier. In patients with FHC, a significant increase of r2and R involving only the IgG1 subclass was observed,indicating the existence of LS of IgG1 in the majority ofthese patients. In the AH of patients with toxoplasmicchorioretinitis, no significant modification of IgG subclassor albumin concentrations was observed when comparedto controls.In conclusion, it would seem interesting to considermeasurement of IgG and IgG subclasses and calculationof the coefficients r1, r2 and R for a better evaluation ofthe local immunological processes observed in differenttypes of uveitis.",2004,International Ophthalmology
A Lower Permian ammonoid fauna from New Mexico,"Representatives of the following six ammonoid genera are illustrated and described from the middle portion of the Hueco formation at three adjacent localities in south-central New Mexico: Medlicottia, Metalegoceras, Thalassoc""ras, Peritrochia, Properrinites, and a new genus termed Bransonoceras. The assemblage resembles that known from the Hueco, Wolfcamp, Admiral, and particularly the Clyde formations of Texas, and it is indicative of the Lower Permian. ECENTLY Dr. Carl C. Branson sent us for study several collections of cephalopods that he and Mr. J. S. Baker had assembled from three rather closely adjacent localities some 35-38 miles south of Alamogordo, Otero County, New Mexico. Many of the specimens are well preserved, and they represent a considerable variety of both nautiloids and ammonoids and seem to merit particular attention. An account of the nautiloids is being included by Miller and Youngquist in a monograph of American Permian forms that they are preparing, and therefore we are limiting our discussion to the ammonoids.

Structure-Aware Multimodal Feature Fusion for RGB-D Scene Classification and Beyond,"While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been excellent for object recognition, the greater spatial variability in scene images typically means that the standard full-image CNN features are suboptimal for scene classification. In this article, we investigate a framework allowing greater spatial flexibility, in which the Fisher vector (FV)-encoded distribution of local CNN features, obtained from a multitude of region proposals per image, is considered instead. The CNN features are computed from an augmented pixel-wise representation consisting of multiple modalities of RGB, HHA, and surface normals, as extracted from RGB-D data. More significantly, we make two postulates: (1) component sparsityâ€”that only a small variety of region proposals and their corresponding FV GMM components contribute to scene discriminability, and (2) modal nonsparsityâ€”that features from all modalities are encouraged to coexist. In our proposed feature fusion framework, these are implemented through regularization terms that apply group lasso to GMM components and exclusive group lasso across modalities. By learning and combining regressors for both proposal-based FV features and global CNN features, we are able to achieve state-of-the-art scene classification performance on the SUNRGBD Dataset and NYU Depth Dataset V2. Moreover, we further apply our feature fusion framework on an action recognition task to demonstrate that our framework can be generalized for other multimodal well-structured features. In particular, for action recognition, we enforce interpart sparsity to choose more discriminative body parts, and intermodal nonsparsity to make informative features from both appearance and motion modalities coexist. Experimental results on the JHMDB and MPII Cooking Datasets show that our feature fusion is also very effective for action recognition, achieving very competitive performance compared with the state of the art.",2018,"ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing, Communications, and Applications (TOMM)"
Variable selection for high dimensional transformation model,"Transformation Regression Model is an important semiparametric regression model. At the initial stage of the regression model building, a lot of variables are available which may result in a very large model, or make model misspecification. Hence Variable selection is a necessary process in practice. However most traditional variable selection methods are not available for the transformation model because of the unknown transformation function and some constraint identified conditions of the model. On the other hand, when the number of variables in the model is larger than the sample size, such as LASSO, SCAD, those penalized methods developed in recently are still suffered in computational burden, and difficult to be applied for the transformation model directly. This research aims to employ the general idea of SIS proposed by Fan and Lv (2008) and rank correlation to propose a new screening method for the ultrahigh dimensional transformation model. By such screening method, the dimension of the model can be reduced, then those penalized methods can be applied to select variables for the transformation model. Hence the two step variable selection procedure for the ultra-high dimension transformation model is proposed, that is applying a screener at first and followed by a non-parametric penalized estimation. Basic screening properties of the proposed method has been investigated and supported by the numerical study.",2010,

DÃ©pistage Des BenzodiazÃ©pines Et Des AntidÃ©presseurs Tricycliques Dans Le SÃ©rum. Bilan De Cinq Ans De ContrÃ´les Inter Hospitaliers,"Pro bio QualAssociation of Lyon have proposed a control which include the control for detecting benzodiazepines (BZD) and tricyclic antidepressants (ADT) since 2000.With this control, we have evaluated the specificity and the sensitivity of techniques used.We have tested the maprotiline reactivity too (tetracyclic antidepressant). We report results achieved with different immunoassay methods and their performances: specificity and sensitivity. The number of laboratories which realize these analyses is constant: these laboratories are hospital laboratories. Two methods are most common used: the fluorescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA) and the enzyme multiplied immunoassay test (EMIT). The evolution of these techniques does square with the evolution of chemistry analysers used in hospital laboratories. For the BZD, the specificity is good. For the ADT, carbamazepine at low concentration (5 mg/L) gives a positive result with FPIA Abbott assay; carbamazepine at high concentration (25 mg/L) gives a negative result with EMIT assay; phenothiazines give a positive response. For the BZD, the analyser Integra gives best results of sensitivity. Results of sensitivity obtained with the kit EMIT DAU are better than results obtained with the kit EMIT Serum. For the ADT, results of sensitivity obtained with FPIA Abbott assay seem better; the adaptation of EMIT assay on Integra analyser gives less good results. The reactivity for the BZD is very different: we can ignore a severe intoxication with alprazolam or lorazepam (response Â« cut off) but we can give a positive result for a therapeutic concentration of diazepam for example. With ADT, we haven't the same problem. But the reactivity for nortriptyline is less good than the reactivity for amitriptyline. So we should use a ""cut off"" concentration which corresponds to the best sensitivity and the best specificity.",2006,Acta Clinica Belgica
"Meillassoux, Correlationism, and the Ontological Difference","Meillassoux defines â€œcorrelationismâ€ as the view that we can only access the mutual dependence of thought and beingâ€”specifically, subjectivity and objectivityâ€”which he attributes to Heidegger. This attribution is inapt. It is only by accessing beingâ€”via existential analysisâ€”that we can properly distinguish beings like subjects and objects. I propose that Meillassouxâ€™s misattribution ignores the ontological difference that drives Heideggerâ€™s project. First, I demonstrate the inadequacy of Meillassouxâ€™s account of correlationism as a criticism of Heidegger and dispense with an objection. Second, I argue that Meillassouxâ€™s neglect of the ontological difference stems from a question-begging appeal to transcendental realism, which is at odds with Heideggerâ€™s twin claims for a variety of transcendental idealism in Being and Time. Third, I offer a reflection on three general marks of transcendental idealism.",2018,
"Vermehrung, Interferenz und Interferoninduktion aviÃ¤rer Herpesvirusarten: Beitrag zur Schutzimpfung gegen die Mareksche Krankheit","Zusammenfassung 
 
Die experimentellen Untersuchungsergebnisse beziehen sich auf drei Themenkreise: 
 
 
 
a) Vermehrung des Puten-Herpesvirus in vitro: Durch Versuche in der Durchstromungskammer sowie durch Untersuchungen mit markierten Antikorpern konnte der Nachweis erbracht werden, das die Virusweitergabe von Zelle zu Zelle durch erregerhaltige Zytoplasmateile erfolgt, die von infizierten Zellen abgeschnurt und kurze Zeit spater von nicht infizierten Zellen aufgenommen werden. Unter Berucksichtigung dieses offenbar den zellassoziierten Herpesviren der Gruppe B eigenen Ubertragungsweges ist eine grosere Virusproduktion bei gleichzeitiger kurzerer Kultivierungszeit moglich. 
 
 
 
b) Interferon: Wahrend drei Puten-Herpesvirusstamme sowie drei apathogene Huhner-Herpesvirusstamme in vitro kein nachweisbares Interferon induzierten, waren drei geprufte pathogene MKV-Stamme in der Lage, sowohl in Huhnerembryofibroblasten- als auch in Huhnerkukennierenzellkulturen die Bildung groser Mengen Interferon zu induzieren. Auf Grund der fehlenden Interferoninduktion durch die drei Puten- und die drei apathogenen Huhner-Herpesvirusstamme kann als sicher gelten, das der Interferonmechanismus nicht fur die Schutzwirkung dieser Stamme gegen das Entstehen der MK in Frage kommt. 
 
 
 
c) Interferenz: Es konnten experimentelle Beweise fur das Vorkommen der homologen Interferenz in vitro erbracht werden. Durch Endpunktpassagen mit einem zeitlichen Abstand von 24 Stunden zwischen Infektion und Passage der Kulturen konnte die Bildung inkompletter interferierender Viruspartikel weitgehend vermieden werden. Inaktiviertes Herpesvirus vermag ebenfalls mit infektiosem Virus zu interferieren. 
 
 
 
Die Infektion von Huhnerkukennierenzellkulturen mit Puten-Herpesvirus und die nachfolgende Infektion mit pathogenem Marekvirus vermochte die Vermehrung des MKV nachhaltig zu hemmen. Dieses in vitro beobachtete, als heterologe Interferenz bezeichnete Ereignis tritt Literaturberichten zufolge auch in vivo auf und wird als eines der Wirkungsprinzipien der Schutzimpfung von Eintagskuken gegen die MK angesehen. 
 
 
 
Summary 
 
Multiplication, interference and interferon induction of avian herpesviruses. Protection against Marek's Disease 
 
 
 
2. Materials and methods, results, discussion and conclusions 
 
 
 
The results of experimental studies relate to three different themes. 
 
 
 
a) Multiplication of turkey herpesvirus in vitro. Studies using the continuous culture chamber and experiments with labelled antibodies have shown that spread of virus from cell to cell takes place by virus-containing cytoplasmic particles which become detached from infected cells and are taken up by uninfected cells. Consideration of this method of transmission of herpesviruses of Group B suggests that a very large amount of virus can be produced in a very short period of culture. 
 
 
 
b) Interferon. Whereas three turkey herpesvirus strains and three nonpathogenic chicken herpesvirus strains produced no demonstrable interferon in vitro, three pathogenic MD virus strains tested were able to induce large amounts of interferon in chick embryo fibroblast cultures and in chick kidney cultures. In the light of the failure of the six strains mentioned above to produce interferon it seems certain that the interferon mechanism is not involved in protection against Marek's disease. 
 
 
 
c) Interference. Experimental proof was obtained of the occurrence of homologous interference in vitro. End-point passages with 24 hour intervals between infection and passage of cultures made it possible to avoid the formation of incomplete interfering virus particles to a large extent. Inactivated herpesvirus can also interfere with infectious virus. 
 
 
 
Infection of chick kidney cell cultures with turkey herpesvirus and subsequent infection with pathogenic MD virus can inhibit subsequent multiplication of MD virus. This in vitro heterologous interference has also been found in vivo and indeed constitutes one of the principles on which protection of day-old chicks against MD is based.

Multiplication, interference et induction d'interferon des especes d'Herpesvirus aviaires: contribution a la vaccination contre la maladie de Marek Communication II 
 
 
 
Les donnees des recherches experimentales reposent sur trois themes: 
 
 
 
a) Multiplication du virus Herpes du dondon in vitro: des recherches dans la chambre de courant et avec des anticorps marques ont montre que le passage du virus de cellule a cellule se fait par l'intermediaire de parties du cytoplasme de virus qui se detachent des cellules infectees pour etre prises ensuite par des cellules non infectees. En considerant ce mode de transmission cellulaire des virus Herpes du group B, il est possible de produire une plus grande quantite du virus dans un temps de culture plus bref. 
 
 
 
b) Interferon: alors que trois souches de virus Herpes du dindon et trois souches apathogenes de la poule n'ont pas induit d'interferon in vitro, trois souches pathogenes testees ont ete en mesure d'induire une grande quantite d'interferons aussi bien dans les cultures de fibroblastes d'embryons de poules que de cellules renales de poussins. Sur la base du manque d'induction d'interferons par les trois souches de dindon et les deux souches apathogenes de poule, on peut admettre que le mecanisme des interferons ne peut pas etre utilise avec sec souches pour une protection lors del l'apparition de la maladie de Marek. 
 
 
 
c) Interference: on a apporte la preuve experimentale de l'apparition de l'interference homologue in vitro. La formation de particules virales interferentes peut etre evitee dans une large mesure par des passages finaux a un intervalle de 24 heures entre une infection et une passage des cultures. Un virus Herpes inactive peut egalement interferer avec un virus infectieux. L'infection des cultures de reins de poussins avec un virus Herpes du dindon et l'infection qui a suivi avec un virus pathogene de la maladie de Marek ont ete capables d'inhiber de facon durable la multiplication du virus. Cet evenement observe in vitro et designe comme une interference heterologue a ete egalement constate in vivo selon la litterature et peut etre considere comme un des principes d'action de la vaccination des poussins d'un jour. 
 
 
 
Resumen 
 
Multiplicacion, interferencia e induccion de interferona de las especies de virus herpes aviar: contribucion a la vacunacion contra la enfermedad de Marek parte II 
 
 
 
Los resultados experimentales de la pesquisa se refieren a tres circulos de temas: 
 
 
 
a) Multiplicacion del virus herpes de pavo in vitro: mediante ensayos en la camara de perfusion y por medio de anticuerpos marcados se aporta la comprobacion de que la cesion de virus de celula acontece mediante partes citoplasmaticas que contienen el agente etiologico, las cuales son acordeladas por celulas infectadas e incorporadas poco tiempo despues por celulas no infectadas. Considerando esta via de transmision, al parecer propia de los virus herpes del grupo B asociados a las celulas, resulta posible una produccion mayor de virus con un tiempo de cultivacion simultanea mas breve. 
 
 
 
b) Interferona: mientras que tres estirpes de virus herpes de pavo y tres estirpes apatogenas de virus herpes de gallina no inducian in vitro ninguna interferona demostrable, se hallaban tres estirpes de VEM patogenas examinadas en condiciones de inducir la formacion de cantidades elevadas de interferona en cultivos celulares de fibroblastos de embriones de pollo y de rinones de pollitos. En consecuencia de la induccion ausente de interferona por las tres estirpes de virus herpes de pavo y las tres apatogenas de gallina puede darse como seguro que el mecanismo de interferona no entra en consideracion para la accion protectora de estas estirpes contra la genesis de la EM. 
 
 
 
c) Interferencia: se pudieron aportar pruebas experimentales de la presencia de interferencia homologa in vitro. Mediante pases terminales con una distancia temporal de 24 horas entre infeccion y pase de los cultivos se pudo impedir en sumo grado la farmacion de particulas viricas interferentes incompletas. El virus herpes inactivado tambien logra interferir con virus infeccioso. 
 
 
 
La infeccion con cultivos celulares de rinones de pollitos con virus herpes de pavo y la infeccion subsiguiente con virus patogeno de Marek consiguio de forma perdurable la multiplicacion del VEM. Este acontecimiento observado in vitro, calificado como interferencia heterologa, tambien se presenta in vivo con arreglo a los informes bibliograficos y se considera como uno de los principios de accion de la vacunacion profilactica de pollitos de un dia contra la EM.",2010,Journal of Veterinary Medicine Series B-infectious Diseases and Veterinary Public Health
Investigating gene expression array with outliers and missing data in bladder cancer,"In this article, we present a methodology to perform selection among genes based on their expression in various groups of patients, in order to find new genetic markers for specific pathologies. Our approach is based on clustering the denoised data and computing a LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) estimator, in order to select the relevant genes. This latter belongs to the class of penalized regression estimators where the penalty is a multiple of the â„“1-norm of the regression vector. Gene markers of the most severe tumor state are finally provided using the proposed approach.",2015,2015 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)
LASSO as a tool for downscaling summer rainfall over the Yangtze River Valley,"ABSTRACT Building statistical downscaling models often faces a large number of potential predictors from atmospheric circulation fields. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) has been used to downscale monthly rainfall in summer over the Yangtze River Valley. Based on the shrinkage of coefficients of the model, LASSO can provide sparse models with many coefficients being zero. Geopotential height at 500-hPa was used as the predictor set. The results show that LASSO can reproduce the spatial pattern of anomalies of rainfall in most years. Furthermore, LASSO can reproduce the shift of the rainfall over the Yangtze River Valley in the late 1970s. The performance of the elastic net was also tested, and its grouping effect should be noted. It was also found that LASSO performs better than principal component regression.",2019,Hydrological Sciences Journal
Introduction: Regional and local development in Australia and New Zealand,"From both an academic and a policy perspective, regional and local development are themes which have oscillated in popularity over time but which continue to show remarkable resilience and persistence, despite the oft assumed aspatiality of dominant discourses of neoliberalism and globalisation. Glasson commented on the â€˜fall and rise of regional planningâ€™ (Glasson, 1992: 505) and some 23 years later this volatility in thinking and practice persists, but so too does a continued attachment to spatial interventions and spatially based development. In recent years, clear economic policy and theoretical shifts, as epitomised by the rise of New Economic Geography, the 2009 World Bank World Development Report (World Bank, 2009), which had economic geography as its guiding theme, and continued decentralisation and spatial planning interventions in numerous countries across the world show the persistent role which regional and local development plays (Pike et al., 2006). The papers assembled in this special issue seek to provide an insight into this fluid developmental terrain through the lens of recent developments in Australia and New Zealand. While both countries are part of the OECD and share similar economic and policy histories with the rest of the OECD, the embeddedness of neoliberalism, particularly in New Zealand (Peet, 2012) and the challenges, opportunities and responses posed by rapid economic growth in Australia, make them particularly interesting case-studies of how places, people and governments adapt to and respond to fluid economic circumstances and change. Australiaâ€™s pursuit of what it terms â€˜structural adjustment programmesâ€™ in response to economic change, and the reality that many mining towns now have transient populations, reflects changes in both the nature of economic activities and how urban systems have to adapt around them (Beer; Perry and Rowe, this issue). In New Zealand, Regional Development, after years in abeyance is now being reinstated but not as redistributive policy grounded on equity but rather as one geared to encourage market based foreign investment (Nel, this issue). It is also apparent that, as the papers in this special issue argue, regional and local development has evolved over time to consider and articulate new discourses and",2015,Local Economy
A computational framework for empirical Bayes inference,"In empirical Bayes inference one is typically interested in sampling from the posterior distribution of a parameter with a hyper-parameter set to its maximum likelihood estimate. This is often problematic particularly when the likelihood function of the hyper-parameter is not available in closed form and the posterior distribution is intractable. Previous works have dealt with this problem using a multi-step approach based on the EM algorithm and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). We propose a framework based on recent developments in adaptive MCMC, where this problem is addressed more efficiently using a single Monte Carlo run. We discuss the convergence of the algorithm and its connection with the EM algorithm. We apply our algorithm to the Bayesian Lasso of Park and CasellaÂ (J. Am. Stat. Assoc. 103:681â€“686, 2008) and on the empirical Bayes variable selection of George and Foster (J. Am. Stat. Assoc. 87:731â€“747, 2000).",2011,Statistics and Computing
Oncologic Surgery of the Lower limb: Anatomical and Functional Results of Cementation Associated with Internal Fixation in the Teaching Hospital of Bobo- Dioulasso (Burkina Faso),"Objective: To evaluate the anatomical and functional results of reconstructive surgery in oncology at the Teaching Hospital of Bobo-Dioulasso. Population and method: It came from a retrospective study conducted in the orthopedics and trauma surgery at the Teaching Hospital of Bobo-Dioulasso from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2012. He was recruited eight patients with a bone tumor of lower limbs. They all benefited from a conservative surgery with bone reconstruction by cementation associated with internal fixation. Functional rehabilitation was systematic. The anatomical treatment outcome was evaluated through visual observation and functional outcome of the score of the Musculoskeletal System. The average follow-up was 2 years. Results: He was recruited eight patients, including five men and three women. The average age was 39 years. We had three cases of bone metastases and five cases of primary tumors including two malignant. The postoperative anatomical result was good. The average score of the musculoskeletal system was 83.33% (25/30). The average follow up was two years. It was noted 25% (n = 2) early postoperative complications.

Distribution and leaf growth of Thalassodendron pachyrhizum den Hartog in Southern Western Australia,"Abstract The seagrass Thalassodendron pachyrhizum den Hartog grows on limestone reef platforms. Monthly leaf biomass was measured over 2 years and showed a strong seasonal variation with maximum biomass of 500 g m âˆ’2 . This seagrass loses all its leaves except for a bud and this characteristic was used to obtain a conservative estimate of productivity by change in standing stock. Leaf growth during the growing season was 6.6 mg Cg âˆ’1 day âˆ’1 . Leaf length frequencies showed that new leaves formed during autumn (Marchâ€“April). They grew from autumn until spring (November) and began to senesce in summer, followed by leaf fall in late summer (Februaryâ€“March).

Balanced k-Means and Min-Cut Clustering,"Clustering is an effective technique in data mining to generate groups that are the matter of interest. Among various clustering approaches, the family of k-means algorithms and min-cut algorithms gain most popularity due to their simplicity and efficacy. The classical k-means algorithm partitions a number of data points into several subsets by iteratively updating the clustering centers and the associated data points. By contrast, a weighted undirected graph is constructed in min-cut algorithms which partition the vertices of the graph into two sets. However, existing clustering algorithms tend to cluster minority of data points into a subset, which shall be avoided when the target dataset is balanced. To achieve more accurate clustering for balanced dataset, we propose to leverage exclusive lasso on k-means and min-cut to regulate the balance degree of the clustering results. By optimizing our objective functions that build atop the exclusive lasso, we can make the clustering result as much balanced as possible. Extensive experiments on several large-scale datasets validate the advantage of the proposed algorithms compared to the state-of-the-art clustering algorithms.",2014,ArXiv

"Carbon storage variability in seagrass meadows of Marine Poton Bako, East Lombok, West Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia","Rahman FA, Qayim I, Wardiatno Y. 2018. Carbon storage variability in seagrass meadows of Marine Poton Bako, East Lombok, West Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 19: 1626-1631. The increase of atmospheric CO2 concentration in the last decades leads to global warming, having an adverse effect on the environment condition on the Earth. One of the natural mechanism as an effort to reduce the impact of global warming is carbon absorption and storage through photosynthesis mechanism of seagrass vegetation. Research conducted at Poton Bako, a district in East Lombok was aimed to reveal the composition of seagrass species, density, seagrass coverage, the biomass of seagrass tissue, content of carbon storage in seagrass tissue (above and below substrates), carbon content in seagrass sediments, and estimation of carbon stock in the area. The research included observation of species composition, and the sample was collected from 0.5 m Ã— 0.5 m plot area. The total plot area was 36 on six lanes with the space between plots 25 m and between lanes 100 m. Six species from two families were found in the seagrass meadows, i.e., Cymodocea rotundata, Enhalus acoroides, Halophila minor, Holodule uninervis, Thalassia hemprichii and Thalassodendron ciliatum. The three highest total densities were C. rotundata 214.67Â±110.469 stands m-2, T. hemprichii 85.11Â±41.471 stands m-2, and H. minor 42.22Â±44.204 stands m-2. Species with the highest coverage value at all observation plots was C. rotundata (33.47Â±26.748 %), and T. ciliatum had the lowest value (2.12Â±5.071 %). The total biomass was 676.32 g DW m-2 with biomass above substrate 329.94Â±57.725 g DW m-2 and below substrate 654.88Â±81.199 g DW m-2. The carbon content of substrate ranged from 0.11% to 0.51% with the average of 0.35Â±0.081%, which was categorized low. The total average of carbon storage in seagrass was 447.92 g C m-2 comprising 142.77 g C m-2 of their tissue above substrate and 305.15 g C m-2 below substrate. Regarding the area, the total carbon stored in seagrass meadows with 56.65 ha area was 249.27 t C ha-1.",2018,Biodiversitas
Optimal Regression Method for Near-Infrared Spectroscopic Evaluation of Articular Cartilage,"Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy has been successful in nondestructive assessment of biological tissue properties, such as stiffness of articular cartilage, and is proposed to be used in clinical arthroscopies. Near-infrared spectroscopic data include absorbance values from a broad wavelength region resulting in a large number of contributing factors. This broad spectrum includes information from potentially noisy variables, which may contribute to errors during regression analysis. We hypothesized that partial least squares regression (PLSR) is an optimal multivariate regression technique and requires application of variable selection methods to further improve the performance of NIR spectroscopy-based prediction of cartilage tissue properties, including instantaneous, equilibrium, and dynamic moduli and cartilage thickness. To test this hypothesis, we conducted for the first time a comparative analysis of multivariate regression techniques, which included principal component regression (PCR), PLSR, ridge regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso), and least squares version of support vector machines (LS-SVM) on NIR spectral data of equine articular cartilage. Additionally, we evaluated the effect of variable selection methods, including Monte Carlo uninformative variable elimination (MC-UVE), competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS), variable combination population analysis (VCPA), backward interval PLS (BiPLS), genetic algorithm (GA), and jackknife, on the performance of the optimal regression technique. The PLSR technique was found as an optimal regression tool (R2Tissue thicknessâ€‰=â€‰75.6%, R2Dynamic modulusâ€‰=â€‰64.9%) for cartilage NIR data; variable selection methods simplified the prediction models enabling the use of lesser number of regression components. However, the improvements in model performance with variable selection methods were found to be statistically insignificant. Thus, the PLSR technique is recommended as the regression tool for multivariate analysis for prediction of articular cartilage properties from its NIR spectra.",2017,Applied Spectroscopy
Collaborative sources identification in mixed signals via hierarchical sparse modeling,"A collaborative framework for detecting the different sources in mixed signals is presented in this paper. The approach is based on C-HiLasso, a convex collaborative hierarchical sparse model, and proceeds as follows. First, we build a structured dictionary for mixed signals by concatenating a set of sub-dictionaries, each one of them learned to sparsely model one of a set of possible classes. Then, the coding of the mixed signal is performed by efficiently solving a convex optimization problem that combines standard sparsity with group and collaborative sparsity. The present sources are identified by looking at the sub-dictionaries automatically selected in the coding. The collaborative filtering in C-HiLasso takes advantage of the temporal/spatial redundancy in the mixed signals, letting collections of samples collaborate in identifying the classes, while allowing individual samples to have different internal sparse representations. This collaboration is critical to further stabilize the sparse representation of signals, in particular the class/sub-dictionary selection. The internal sparsity inside the sub-dictionaries, as naturally incorporated by the hierarchical aspects of C-HiLasso, is critical to make the model consistent with the essence of the sub-dictionaries that have been trained for sparse representation of each individual class. We present applications from speaker and instrument identification and texture separation. In the case of audio signals, we use sparse modeling to describe the short-term power spectrum envelopes of harmonic sounds. The proposed pitch independent method automatically detects the number of sources on a recording.",2011,"2011 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)"
De-biasing the Lasso: Optimal Sample Size for Gaussian Designs,"Performing statistical inference in high-dimension is an outstanding challenge. A major source of difficulty is the absence of precise information on the distribution of high-dimensional estimators. Here, we consider linear regression in the high-dimensional regime $p\gg n$. In this context, we would like to perform inference on a high-dimensional parameters vector $\theta^*\in{\mathbb R}^p$. Important progress has been achieved in computing confidence intervals for single coordinates $\theta^*_i$. A key role in these new methods is played by a certain debiased estimator $\hat{\theta}^{\rm d}$ that is constructed from the Lasso. Earlier work establishes that, under suitable assumptions on the design matrix, the coordinates of $\hat{\theta}^{\rm d}$ are asymptotically Gaussian provided $\theta^*$ is $s_0$-sparse with $s_0 = o(\sqrt{n}/\log p )$. The condition $s_0 = o(\sqrt{n}/ \log p )$ is stronger than the one for consistent estimation, namely $s_0 = o(n/ \log p)$. We study Gaussian designs with known or unknown population covariance. When the covariance is known, we prove that the debiased estimator is asymptotically Gaussian under the nearly optimal condition $s_0 = o(n/ (\log p)^2)$. Note that earlier work was limited to $s_0 = o(\sqrt{n}/\log p)$ even for perfectly known covariance. The same conclusion holds if the population covariance is unknown but can be estimated sufficiently well, e.g. under the same sparsity conditions on the inverse covariance as assumed by earlier work. For intermediate regimes, we describe the trade-off between sparsity in the coefficients and in the inverse covariance of the design. We further discuss several applications of our results to high-dimensional inference. In particular, we propose a new estimator that is minimax optimal up to a factor $1+o_n(1)$ for i.i.d. Gaussian designs.",2015,arXiv: Statistics Theory
Evaluation of statistical models for predicting Escherichia coli particle attachment in fluvial systems.,"Modeling surface water Escherichia coli fate and transport requires partitioning E. coli into particle-attached and unattached fractions. Attachment is often assumed to be a constant fraction or is estimated using simple linear models. The objectives of this study were to: (i) develop statistical models for predicting E. coli attachment and virulence marker presence in fluvial systems, and (ii) relate E. coli attachment to a variety of environmental parameters. Stream water samples (n = 60) were collected at four locations in a rural, mixed-use watershed between June and October 2012, with four storm events (>20 mm rainfall) being captured. The percentage of E. coli attached to particles (>5 Î¼m) and the occurrences of virulence markers were modeled using water quality, particle concentration, particle size distribution, hydrology and land use factors as explanatory variables. Three types of statistical models appropriate for highly collinear, multidimensional data were compared: least angle shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), classification and regression trees using the general, unbiased, interaction detection and estimation (GUIDE) algorithm, and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS). All models showed that E. coli particle attachment and the presence of E. coli virulence markers in the attached and unattached states were influenced by a combination of water quality, hydrology, land-use and particle properties. Model performance statistics indicate that MARS models outperform LASSO and GUIDE models for predicting E. coli particle attachment and virulence marker occurrence. Validating the MARS modeling approach in multiple watersheds may allow for the development of a parameterizing model to be included in watershed simulation models.",2013,Water research
Estimating Structured Vector Autoregressive Model,"While considerable advances have been made in estimating high-dimensional structured models from independent data using Lasso-type models, limited progress has been made for settings when the samples are dependent. We consider estimating structured VAR (vector auto-regressive models), where the structure can be captured by any suitable norm, e.g., Lasso, group Lasso, order weighted Lasso, sparse group Lasso, etc. In VAR setting with correlated noise, although there is strong dependence over time and covariates, we establish bounds on the non-asymptotic estimation error of structured VAR parameters. Surprisingly, the estimation error is of the same order as that of the corresponding Lasso-type estimator with independent samples, and the analysis holds for any norm. Our analysis relies on results in generic chaining, sub-exponential martingales, and spectral representation of VAR models. Experimental results on synthetic data with a variety of structures as well as real aviation data are presented, validating theoretical results.",2016,arXiv: Statistics Theory
Thresholding Procedures for High Dimensional Variable Selection and Statistical Estimation,"Given n noisy samples with p dimensions, where n â‰ª p, we show that the multi-step thresholding procedure can accurately estimate a sparse vector Î² âˆˆ â„p in a linear model, under the restricted eigenvalue conditions (Bickel-Ritov-Tsybakov 09). Thus our conditions for model selection consistency are considerably weaker than what has been achieved in previous works. More importantly, this method allows very significant values of s, which is the number of non-zero elements in the true parameter. For example, it works for cases where the ordinary Lasso would have failed. Finally, we show that if X obeys a uniform uncertainty principle and if the true parameter is sufficiently sparse, the Gauss-Dantzig selector (Candes-Tao 07) achieves the l2 loss within a logarithmic factor of the ideal mean square error one would achieve with an oracle which would supply perfect information about which coordinates are non-zero and which are above the noise level, while selecting a sufficiently sparse model.",2009,

Lasso-type estimation for covariate-adjusted linear model,"ABSTRACT Lasso is popularly used for variable selection in recent years. In this paper, lasso-type penalty functions including lasso and adaptive lasso are employed in simultaneously variable selection and parameter estimation for covariate-adjusted linear model, where the predictors and response cannot be observed directly and distorted by some observable covariate through some unknown multiplicative smooth functions. Estimation procedures are proposed and some asymptotic properties are obtained under some mild conditions. It deserves noting that under appropriate conditions, the adaptive lasso estimator correctly select covariates with nonzero coefficients with probability converging to one and that the estimators of nonzero coefficients have the same asymptotic distribution that they would have if the zero coefficients were known in advance, i.e. the adaptive lasso estimator has the oracle property in the sense of Fan and Li [6]. Simulation studies are carried out to examine its performance in finite sample situations and the Boston Housing data is analyzed for illustration.",2018,Journal of Applied Statistics

Learning Discriminative Dictionary for Facial Expression Recognition,"ABSTRACTSparse coding is currently an active subject in signal processing, computer vision, pattern recognition, etc. Fisher discrimination dictionary learning (FDDL) is a recently developed discriminative dictionary learning method and exhibits promising performance for classification. However, FDDL could not capture the locality structure of data, and it produces discriminative sparse coding coefficients, which is not effective enough for classification. To address these issues, this paper proposes an advanced version of FDDL by integrating data locality and group Lasso regularization in the procedure of FDDL's sparse coding. The proposed method is used to learn locality- and group-sensitive discriminative dictionary for facial expression recognition. Our experimental results on two public facial expression databases, i.e., the JAFFE database and the Cohnâ€“Kanade database, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on facial expression recognition tasks, giving a significant performance improve...",2018,Iete Technical Review
The Broken Adaptive Ridge Procedure and Its Applications,"In this study, we employ the broken adaptive ridge method to estimate the lower-dimensional patterns of the coefficients in regression models. Based on a reweighted `2-penalization, the new method simultaneously recovers the true sparsity and the inherent structures of the features, making it theoretically and practically appealing. The resulting estimate is shown to enjoy the oracle property. The proposed method also contains a set of variable selection or pattern estimation methods. As a special case, the fused broken adaptive ridge, which penalizes the differences between adjacent coefficients, is thoroughly discussed, with applications to signal approximation and image processing. The associated algorithms are numerically easy to implement. Simulation studies and real-data analyses illustrate the advantages of the proposed method over the fused lasso method.",2020,Statistica Sinica

Larval traits carry over to affect post-settlement behaviour in a common coral reef fish.,"Most reef fishes begin life as planktonic larvae before settling to the reef, metamorphosing and entering the benthic adult population. Different selective forces determine survival in the planktonic and benthic life stages, but traits established in the larval stage may carry over to affect post-settlement performance. We tested the hypothesis that larval traits affect two key post-settlement fish behaviours: social group-joining and foraging. Certain larval traits of reef fishes are permanently recorded in the rings in their otoliths. In the bluehead wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum), prior work has shown that key larval traits recorded in otoliths (growth rate, energetic condition at settlement) carry over to affect post-settlement survival on the reef, with higher-larval-condition fish experiencing less post-settlement mortality. We hypothesized that this selective mortality is mediated by carry-over effects on post-settlement antipredator behaviours. We predicted that better-condition fish would forage less and be more likely to join groups, both behaviours that would reduce predation risk. We collected 550 recently settled bluehead wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum) from three reef sites off St. Croix (USVI) and performed two analyses. First, we compared each settler's larval traits to the size of its social group to determine whether larval traits influenced group-joining behaviour. Secondly, we observed foraging behaviour in a subset of grouped and solitary fish (nÂ =Â 14) for 1-4Â days post-settlement. We then collected the fish and tested whether larval traits influenced the proportion of time spent foraging. Body length at settlement, but not condition, affected group-joining behaviour; smaller fish were more likely to remain solitary or in smaller groups. However, both greater length and better condition were associated with greater proportions of time spent foraging over four consecutive days post-settlement. Larval traits carry over to affect post-settlement behaviour, although not as we expected: higher quality larvae join groups more frequently (safer) but then forage more. Foraging is risky but may allow faster post-settlement growth, reducing mortality risk in the long run. This shows that behaviour likely serves as a mechanistic link connecting larval traits to post-settlement selective mortality.",2016,The Journal of animal ecology
Environmental Controls of Cryptogam Composition and Diversity in Anthropogenic and Natural Peatland Ecosystems of Chilean Patagonia,"Peatlands exhibit highly characteristic ecological traits and are unique complex ecosystems. Nevertheless, knowledge about southern South American peatlands is very limited. In this study, we analyzed species composition of bryophytes and lichens of Southern Hemisphere peatlands, specifically from eight peatlands of Isla Grande de ChiloÃ© (ChiloÃ© Island) in southern Chile (42Â°â€“43Â°S and 75Â°â€“73Â°W). Two kinds of Sphagnum peatlands were studied: natural and anthropogenic peatlands. Our results indicate the existence of clear environmental gradients affecting the structure of bryo-lichenic communities in the Sphagnum peatlands of ChiloÃ©. Canonical correspondence analysis suggests that variation in bryophyte and lichen species composition mainly follows ombrotrophicâ€“minerotrophic and lithotrophic-thalassotrophic gradients. Surface-water chemistry is the most significant factor accounting for changes in floristic composition among our study sites. In contrast to our expectations, bog origin (natural or anthropic) was not the most significant factor accounting for changes in floristic composition among peatlands. Other elements, such as the water source supplying peatlands or the influence of sea spray, were more relevant in the bryo-lichenic flora species occurrence in the peatlands of ChiloÃ©. We also observed clear differences in ecological niches among species in general additive model response curves. Therefore, our results show that despite the origin, the ecology of peatlands follows common rules with peatlands from the Northern Hemisphere.",2017,Ecosystems
Stable phylogenetic patterns in scutigeromorph centipedes (Myriapodaâ€‰:â€‰Chilopodaâ€‰:â€‰Scutigeromorpha): dating the diversification of an ancient lineage of terrestrial arthropods,"Abstract. Although stable and well-supported relationships are in place for the three main clades (families) of Scutigeromorpha, the interrelationships of particular taxa within the most diverse family, Scutigeridae, are less clearly resolved. Novel molecular data for taxa from Mesoamerica, the Caribbean, southern Africa, New Guinea and previously unsampled parts of the Pacific are incorporated into phylogenetic analyses. Relationships across the tree are stable under variable analytical conditions, whether these are homology-based (multiple sequence alignment versus implied alignment; untrimmed versus trimmed datasets) or method-based (parsimony versus maximum likelihood). Hypervariable regions, contrary to common belief, add phylogenetic structure to the data, as measured by the increased support for many nodes when compared with the same alignments trimmed with Gblocks. Our analyses show that a Yule-3-rate model best explained the diversification of Scutigeromorpha during their 400â€‰million years of history. More complete molecular data for the New Guinea genus Ballonema stabilise its position as sister group to Thereuoneminae. To reconcile scutigeromorph systematics with the phylogeny, the monotypic genus Madagassophora Verhoeff, 1936, is placed in synonymy with Scutigerina Silvestri, 1901 (n. syn.), its type species M. hova becoming Scutigerina hova (de Saussure & Zehntner, 1902) new comb. (from Scutigera), and Lassophora Verhoeff, 1905, is re-established for an Afro-Malagasy clade containing Lassophora nossibei (de Saussure & Zehntner, 1902) new comb. (from Scutigera) and a newly sequenced species from Mozambique that diverged at the base of the lineage to Thereuoneminae. The dated phylogeny of Scutigeromorpha is more consistent with ancient vicariant splits between Madagascarâ€“southern Africa and Australiaâ€“New Caledonia than with younger dispersal scenarios, though some geologically young Pacific islands that harbour lineages dating to the Cretaceous demonstrate the potential for trans-oceanic dispersal.",2013,Invertebrate Systematics
Tolloid cleavage activates latent GDF8 by priming the pro-complex for dissociation.,"Growth differentiation factor 8 (GDF8)/myostatin is a latent TGF-Î² family member that potently inhibits skeletal muscle growth. Here, we compared the conformation and dynamics of precursor, latent, and Tolloid-cleaved GDF8 pro-complexes to understand structural mechanisms underlying latency and activation of GDF8. Negative stain electron microscopy (EM) of precursor and latent pro-complexes reveals a V-shaped conformation that is unaltered by furin cleavage and sharply contrasts with the ring-like, cross-armed conformation of latent TGF-Î²1. Surprisingly, Tolloid-cleaved GDF8 does not immediately dissociate, but in EM exhibits structural heterogeneity consistent with partial dissociation. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange was not affected by furin cleavage. In contrast, Tolloid cleavage, in the absence of prodomain-growth factor dissociation, increased exchange in regions that correspond in pro-TGF-Î²1 to the Î±1-helix, latency lasso, and Î²1-strand in the prodomain and to the Î²6'- and Î²7'-strands in the growth factor. Thus, these regions are important in maintaining GDF8 latency. Our results show that Tolloid cleavage activates latent GDF8 by destabilizing specific prodomain-growth factor interfaces and primes the growth factor for release from the prodomain.",2018,The EMBO journal
"Commentary on ""Discretion, Rules and Volatility","C ostas Azariadis and Vincenzo Galasso address a basic but very important question about the social security system. What are the incentives for young workers to contribute funds and thus maintain such a system? The issue is to understand the economic and political forces that combine to provide the foundations for a social security system. The starting point of the analysis is perhaps one of the most familiar propositions in macroeconomics. Consider a simple overlapping generations (OLG) model in which identical agents live and consume in each of two periods and have endowments of goods in both periods of life. Though agents are identical within a generation, the potential exists for exchange across generations. Competitive equilibria of this economy may be inefficient: Owing to the infinite horizon, it may be possible to start at autarky (a competitive equilibrium) and redistribute goods across agents of different generations. The desirability of this intergenerational redistribution comes from the pattern of endowments and the nature of intertemporal preferences as shown in Figure 1 of â€œDiscretion, Rules and Volatility.â€",1997,
Ethnicity and Markets : Supplier Credit in African Manufacturing },"This paper investigates whether market interaction can, by itself, perpetuate the lack of ethÂ­ nic diversity that is observed in the business communities of many developing countries. It examines the role of statistical discrimination and networks effects in the allocation of supplier credit and, hence, in the persistence of ethnically homogeneous business groups. We show that members of a successful business community may rationally choose not to grant trade credit to members of other communities if the latter are, on average, less experienced or if they are not part of their reputation network. Using case study data on manufacturing firms in Kenya and Zimbabwe, we uncover evidence that blacks and women are disadvantaged in the attribution of supplier credit. Although we cannot rule out the presence of discrimination, the bulk of the eviÂ­ dence indicates that network effects play an important role in explaining ethnic and gender bias. 1 I benefitted from discussions with and comments from Chris Udry, A vner Greif. Masa Aoki. Jonathan Conning. Pradeep Srivastava, Tyler Biggs. John Pender. Paul Collier. Jan Gunning, and participants to various seminars and conferences and to the symposium on Markets in Africa held in Stanford on March 29-31. 1996. In many developing countries, the ethnic makeup of local business communities is quite different from that of the population at large. It is not uncommon for members of a particular ethÂ­ nic or religious group, or even for residents of foreign origin, to account for an overwhelming proportion of entrepreneurs. The historical record too is replete with examples of a particular ethÂ­ nic group dominating commerce for extended periods of time (e.g., Braudel (1986), Greif (1993, 1994)). Accounts by historians, anthropologists and sociologists also demonstrate that the ethnic and religious background of dominant business groups varies considerably from place to place (e.g., Geertz, Geertz and Rosen (1979), Geertz (1963), Amselle (1977), Staatz (1979), Cohen (1969), Meillassoux (1971), Bauer (1954), Jones (1972)). It even varies across economic activiÂ­ ties within the same country.2 Lack of business diversity is a priori inefficient: drawing entrepreneurs from a small talent pool reduces the average quality of local entrepreneurship. It is also inequitable as it leads to income disparities between groups that inevitably fuel political tenÂ­ sion (e.g., Himbara (1994), Marris (1971)). Animosity toward prosperous ethnic or religious groups may, in tum, serve as investment disincentive if members of the group fear being subseÂ­ quently expropriated. Such fears are not baseless, as the historical record demonstrates.3 Colonial policies4 and other historical and political factors have often favored particular ethnic groups and communities, enabling them to gain a dominant position in a particular segÂ­ ment of economic activity. These factors, however, do not explain why ethnic concentration perÂ­ sists long after favorable factors and policies have been removed. The post-independence experience of many African countries, for instance. suggests that, once a group has established a dominant position in an activity. it can retain its advantage long after initially favorable condiÂ­ tions have been eliminated -and even after having been actively combatted by post-colonial 2 The fish trade in Kenya, for instance, is dominated by the Luos, while textile manufacturing is largely in the hands of Kenyan-Asians. 3 E.g., the expulsion of Asians from Uganda in the 1970's. 4 Including those of the white-dominated government of the Unilateral Declaration of Independence era in Zimbabwe.",2010,
Variable selection in Cox regression models with varying coefficients,"We deal with two kinds of Cox regression models with varying coefficients. The coefficients vary with time in one model. In the other model, there is an important random variable called an index variable and the coefficients vary with the variable. In both models, we have p-dimensional covariates and p increases moderately. However, it is the case that only a small part of the covariates are relevant in these situations. We carry out variable selection and estimation of the coefficient functions by using the group SCAD-type estimator and the adaptive group Lasso estimator. We examine the theoretical properties of the estimators, especially the L2 convergence rate, the sparsity, and the oracle property. Simulation studies and a real data analysis show the performance of these new techniques.",2014,Journal of Statistical Planning and Inference
Efficient Algorithms for Fixed-Precision Instances of Bin Packing and Euclidean TSP,"This paper presents new, polynomial time algorithms for Bin Packing and Euclidean TSP under fixed precision. In this model, integers are encoded as floating point numbers, each with a mantissa and an exponent. Thus, an integer iwith $i = a_i2^{t_i}$ has mantissa a i and exponent t i . This natural representation is the norm in real-world optimization. A set of integers Ihas L-bit precisionif $\max_{i \in I} a_i . In this framework, we show an exact algorithm for Bin Packing and an FPTAS for Euclidean TSP which run in time poly(n) and poly(n+ log1/iÂ¾?), respectively, when Lis a fixed constant. Our algorithm for the later problem is exact when distances are given by the L 1 norm. In contrast, both problems are strongly NP-Hard (and yield PTASs) when precision is unbounded. These algorithms serve as evidence of the significance of the classof fixed precision polynomial time solvable problems. Taken together with algorithms for the Knapsack and Pm||C max problems introduced by Orlin et al., [10] we see that fixed precision defines a class incomparable to polynomial time approximation schemes, covering at least four distinct natural NP-hard problems.",2008,

Model selection: a decision-theoretic approach,"This manuscript addresses the problem of model selection, studied in the linear regression framework. The objective is to determine the best predictive model based on observed data, that is, the model realizing the best tradeoff between goodness of fit and complexity. Our main contribution consists in deriving model evaluation criteria based on tools from Decision Theory, in particular loss estimation. Such criteria rely on a distributional assumption larger than the classical Gaussian hypothesis with independent observations: the family of spherically symmetric distributions. This family of laws allows us to relax the independence assumption and thus brings robustness, since our criteria do not depend on the specific form of the distribution. We also propose a method for comparing model evaluation criteria through a Mean-Squared Error type measure. Our second contribution tackles the problem of constructing the models we compare. The conditions of models considered are obtained from sparse regularization methods, namely the Lasso and related methods. In particular, we studied the Minimax Concave Penalty (MCP), which keeps Lasso's selection while correcting its estimation bias. However, this penalty corresponds to a non differentiable and non- convex optimization problem. The generalization of subdifferentials with Clarke differentials allowed us to derive the optimality conditions d'optimalite and to propose a regularization path algorithm for MCP. Finally, we compare our propositions to the literature through a numerical study, in which we verify the quality of the selection. The results especially show that our criteria yield performances similar to the literature, and that frequently used criteria such as Cross Validation do not always result in good performances.",2013,

Serum metabolites predict response to angiotensin II receptor blockers in patients with diabetes mellitus,"BackgroundIndividual patients show a large variability in albuminuria response to angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB). Identifying novel biomarkers that predict ARB response may help tailor therapy. We aimed to discover and validate a serum metabolite classifier that predicts albuminuria response to ARBs in patients with diabetes mellitus and micro- or macroalbuminuria.MethodsLiquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry metabolomics was performed on serum samples. Data from patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria (nÂ =Â 49) treated with irbesartan 300Â mg/day were used for discovery. LASSO and ridge regression were performed to develop the classifier. Improvement in albuminuria response prediction was assessed by calculating differences in R2 between a reference model of clinical parameters and a model with clinical parameters and the classifier. The classifier was externally validated in patients with type 1 diabetes and macroalbuminuria (nÂ =Â 50) treated with losartan 100Â mg/day. Molecular process analysis was performed to link metabolites to molecular mechanisms contributing to ARB response.ResultsIn discovery, median change in urinary albumin excretion (UAE) was âˆ’42Â % [Q1â€“Q3: âˆ’69 to âˆ’8]. The classifier, consisting of 21 metabolites, was significantly associated with UAE response to irbesartan (pÂ <Â 0.001) and improved prediction of UAE response on top of the clinical reference model (R2 increase from 0.10 to 0.70; pÂ <Â 0.001).

EscolaritzaciÃ³ de fills d'immigrants no comunitaris en Centres Privats Concertats,"El punt de partida de la recerca es la constatacio que Espanya sha configurat com a pais receptor dimmigracio, aquest fet ha suposat larribada duna nova poblacio, portadora de llengues i cultures diferents, la immigrant. La seva presencia ens confronta amb el repte dacollir i dincloure lalteritat. Aquesta tasca on es fa mes visible i es planteja amb mes urgencia es a les escoles.
La presencia del nou alumnat provoca desajustaments en la dinamica dels centres, tensions i angoixes entre els pares i els professionals. A tot aixo cal afegir-hi les disfuncions entre els discursos oficials i les practiques.
Aquesta problematica incipient en els Centres Privats Concertats te dimensions especifiques que fan que lestudi del fenomen en aquest ambit sigui especialment interessant.
Lescola com a lloc de tensio, de crisi, de conflicte, per tant com a oportunitat de canvi, es el territori que aquesta recerca ha volgut explorar. Entenent que una crisi es converteix en un desastre nomes quan responem amb judicis preestablerts (prejudicis).
Des daquesta optica proposem noves mirades sobre:
- Lescola, lentenem com a territori de Xocs Culturals.
- El conflicte, veiem la necessitat de superar la lectura reduccionalista de la Pedagogia, que lassocia a manca de disciplina, proposem la construccio duna nova cultura i una nova sensibilitat que lentengui com a possibilitat de dialeg i de construccio de ponts interculturals.
- El canvi, proposem un nou concepte, mes complex que superi la visio classica que lenten com una forma de desenvolupament ample i lineal, substituint-la per una imatge rizomatica que es desenvolupa en multiples direccions i amb intensitats diverses. Ens interessen les continuitats, els espais intermitjos, lo marginal pot ser un factor de transformacio de lo instituit.
El metode danalisi de casos en ha permes establir una aproximacio tipologica a les diferents respostes en relacio al canvi, posant de manifest les intensitats i les direccions diverses en que safronta el problema. Evidenciant linies de claror i ombres, interessants per detectar futures problematiques.
The starting point of the research is the situation in which Spain finds itself as a destination country for immigrants. This fact has entailed the arrival of a new population the immigrant population which has brought different languages and cultures. Its presence confronts us with the challenge of welcoming and including otherness. Where this task is most visible and is raised as an issue most urgently is in schools.
The presence of the new pupils causes mismatches in the dynamics of the schools, tension and anxiety among parents and professionals. On top of all this we have to add the dichotomy between official rhetoric and practice.
This incipient problem in Concerted Private Schools has specific dimensions which make the study of the phenomenon in this area particularly interesting.
School as a place of tension, crisis, conflict and therefore as an opportunity for change, is the territory which this research aims to explore, considering that a crisis becomes a disaster only when we respond with preconceived judgements (prejudices).
From this standpoint, we propose new outlooks on:
- School, which we consider to be territory of Culture Shocks.
- Conflict, where we see the need to overcome the reductionalist view of Pedagogy, which links it to lack of discipline. We propose the construction of a new culture and a new sensibility which regards it as a possibility for dialogue and for building bridges between cultures.
- Change, for which we propose a new and more complex concept which overcomes the classic view that sees it as a wide, lineal development, replacing it with a rhizomatous image developing in numerous directions and with varying intensity. We are concerned with continuities, intermediate spaces; what is marginal may be a transforming factor of what is established.
The case-study methodology has enabled us to establish a typological approach to the different responses to change, bringing to light the different intensities and directions from which the problem is approached, revealing lines of light and shade which are interesting with a view to detecting future problems.",2003,

"Somatic Mutations of ASXL1, RUNX1 and SETBP1 Improve Prognostic Stratification of Patients with Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia","Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by a highly variable clinical course. Based on clinical, hematologic and cytogenetic parameters, we previously developed a CMML-specific Prognostic Scoring System (CPSS) that stratifies patients into 4 different risk groups [ Blood 2013;121:3005-15 ]. Recently, recurrent somatic mutations have been identified in CMML, and preliminary evidence suggests that selected mutated genes may provide useful prognostic information.

In this study, we performed a comprehensive mutation analysis of genes implicated in myeloid malignancies in a large and well characterized cohort of CMML patients with the aim to dissect relationships between genotype and disease phenotype and to integrate somatic mutations into a clinical/molecular prognostic model.

Thirty-eight genes were analyzed by high throughput sequencing (Illumina MiSeq, San Diego, CA) in a cohort of 199 CMML patients (pts) diagnosed according to WHO classification, and in 12 pts with monocytosis not fulfilling WHO diagnostic criteria. Myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative subtypes (CMML-MD and CMML-MP, respectively) were defined according to FAB criteria. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) and Cox proportional hazards methods were adopted to select and weight variables for prognostic scoring.

Ninety-three percent of pts showed at least one somatic mutation (median number per patient: 2, range 0-6). The most frequently mutated genes were TET2 (44%), SRSF2 (43%), ASXL1 (34%), KRAS (11%), NRAS (10%), CUX1 (10%) , CBL (9%), RUNX1 (7%), SETBP1 (7%), JAK2 (6%), SF3B1 (6%), and U2AF1 (5%). A significant association was found between mutations in TET2 and RNA splicing factors (P=.037), 42 of 199 CMML pts (21%) showing co-occurrence of TET2 and SRSF2 mutations. Mutations in genes involved in signaling were significantly associated with CMML-MP (P=.002), whereas SF3B1 mutations were associated with CMML-MD (P=.024).

The number of mutations per patient inversely correlated with overall survival (OS) (HR=1.32, P=.021). In univariate analysis, mutations in ASXL1 (HR=2.31, P=.026) , RUNX1 (HR=3.53, P=.02) and SETBP1 (HR=3.85, P=.005) significantly affected OS. Focusing the analysis on disease subtype, ASXL1 mutations significantly affected survival in CMML-MD (HR=3.45, P=.025), whereas CUX1 and SETBP1 had a significant prognostic value in CMML-MP (HR=4.33, P=.013 and HR=4.4, P=.025, respectively).

In order to investigate the additive value of somatic mutations to current prognostic assessment, we first fitted a Lasso Cox regression model for genetic variable selection. The selected variables were then included in an unpenalized Cox regression in order to obtain unbiased coefficients. The statistically significant variables were CPSS-specific cytogenetic risk groups (HR=2.49, P=.001), mutations in ASXL1 (HR=2.77, P=.018), RUNX1 (HR=5.39, P=.009) and SETBP1 (HR=3.96, P=.013). Based on regression coefficients, we defined a CMML-specific genetic risk score that was able to identify three different groups (Low risk: normal karyotype and â€“Y; Intermediate: other abnormalities, mutations in ASXL1 ; High: trisomy 8, complex karyotype, mutations in RUNX1 or SETBP1 ), with significantly different OS (HR=2.24, P<.001). The Akaike information criterion showed that this genetic risk score performed better than the original CPSS cytogenetic risk classification (AIC 274 vs. 282, respectively). According to the CMML-specific genetic risk score, 36% of patients had a shift toward a higher risk category compared with cytogenetic risk classification. Then, the new genetic risk categories were integrated in the CPSS (CPSS-Mol), which was able to identify 4 risk groups with different OS (HR=2.29, P<.001) and risk of disease progression (HR=2.62, P<.001). As a robustness analysis, we also fitted a Lasso Cox regression model including clinical and genetic variables, and all variables included in the clinical/molecular score were confirmed. The Akaike information criterion showed that the CPSS-Mol performed better than the original CPSS (AIC 251 vs. 253, respectively).

In conclusion, this study showed that mutation pattern in CMML significantly correlates with disease phenotype. The integration of somatic mutations in current scoring systems significantly improves prognostic stratification of patients.

Non-asymptotic Confidence Regions for Regularized Linear Regression Estimates,"Building confidence regions for regression models is of high importance, for example, they can be used for uncertainty quantification and are also fundamental for robust optimization. In practice, these regions are often computed from the asymptotic distributions, which however only lead to heuristic confidence sets. Sign-Perturbed Sums (SPS) is a resampling method which can construct exact, non-asymptotic, distribution-free confidence regions under very mild statistical assumptions. In its standard form, the SPS regions are built around the least-squares estimate of linear regression problems, and have favorable properties, such as they are star convex, strongly consistent, and have efficient ellipsoidal outer-approximations. In this paper, we extend the SPS method to regularized estimates, particularly, we present variants of SPS for ridge regression, LASSO and elastic net regularization.",2019,

"The Theory Behind Overfitting, Cross Validation, Regularization, Bagging, and Boosting: Tutorial","In this tutorial paper, we first define mean squared error, variance, covariance, and bias of both random variables and classification/predictor models. Then, we formulate the true and generalization errors of the model for both training and validation/test instances where we make use of the Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimator (SURE). We define overfitting, underfitting, and generalization using the obtained true and generalization errors. We introduce cross validation and two well-known examples which are $K$-fold and leave-one-out cross validations. We briefly introduce generalized cross validation and then move on to regularization where we use the SURE again. We work on both $\ell_2$ and $\ell_1$ norm regularizations. Then, we show that bootstrap aggregating (bagging) reduces the variance of estimation. Boosting, specifically AdaBoost, is introduced and it is explained as both an additive model and a maximum margin model, i.e., Support Vector Machine (SVM). The upper bound on the generalization error of boosting is also provided to show why boosting prevents from overfitting. As examples of regularization, the theory of ridge and lasso regressions, weight decay, noise injection to input/weights, and early stopping are explained. Random forest, dropout, histogram of oriented gradients, and single shot multi-box detector are explained as examples of bagging in machine learning and computer vision. Finally, boosting tree and SVM models are mentioned as examples of boosting.",2019,ArXiv
Hydrophobicity effect on oil degradation by two marine bacterial strains Alcanivorax borkumensis and Thalassolituus oleivorans,"Variations on hydrophobicity were monitored in two marine obligate hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria: Alcanivorax borkumensis SK2T and Thalassolituus oleivoras MIL-1T. These strains were inoculated, separately in ONR7a mineral medium with different concentration of sodium acetate. During 10 days measurements of cellular abundance and cellular hydrophobicity (capacity to adhere at polystyrene) were carried out. Data obtained revealed that the natures of carbon source and growth phase are important factors in the regulation of adhesion of bacteria to the surfaces. Moreover Alcanivorax showed a major capability to colonize polystyrene respect on Thalassolituus in the experimented conditions. The understanding of capacity to adhesion of these bacteria for utilization of hydrophobic compounds is fundamental for their potential use in the mitigation of oil spills phenomenon.",2015,
Low complexity predistortion and equalization in nonlinear multicarrier satellite communications,"Aiming to reduce the power/mass requirements in satellite transponders and to reduce mission costs, joint amplification of multiple carriers using a single high-power amplifier (HPA) is being considered. In this scenario, a careful investigation of the resulting power efficiency is essential as amplification is nonlinear, and multicarrier signals exhibit enlarged peak-to-average power ratio. Thus, operating the amplifier close to saturation vastly increases signal distortion resulting in a severe degradation of performance, especially for higher order modulations. This paper proposes a reduced-complexity digital predistortion (DPD) scheme at the transmitter and a corresponding equalizer (EQ) at the receiver to mitigate these nonlinear effects. Scenarios include both the forward as well as the return links. In particular, the paper exploits the MIMO Volterra representation and builds on a basis pursuit approach using a LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) algorithm to achieve an efficient basis representation, avoiding large computational complexity, to describe the selection of predistorter/equalizer model. The work further compares and contrasts the two mitigation techniques taking various system aspects into consideration. The gains in performance and amplification efficiency demonstrated by the use of DPD/ EQ motivate their inclusion in next-generation satellite systems.",2015,EURASIP Journal on Advances in Signal Processing
