Learning the Network Structure of Heterogenerous Data via Pairwise Exponential MRF,"Markov random fields (MRFs) are a fundamental fool on data modeling. And the study on inferring the network structure (or Markov structure) has provoked an interested in many applications in machine learning. Often, it is necessary to model MRFs between heterogeneous entities, where the nodes in the graphical model can refer to different types of objects. For example, modeling medical patients may require joint reasoning about categorical and continuous variables (i.e., age, gender and medical history events) [1]. Or, when analyzing protein interactions, data about different types of proteins might be captured using different experimental methods [13]. In order to faithfully model such domains using graphical models, nodes of the model must follow different types of distributions (Gaussian, Poisson, Binary, etc.). While the structure of such heterogeneous graphical models is typically learned through observational data, estimating them is a challenging problem for both computational and mathematical reasons, and scalable inference methods have not yet been developed. In this paper, we propose a subset of the multivariate exponential family distribution, which we call the pairwise exponential Markov random field (PE-MRF). Our PE-MRF model explicitly reveals the Markov structure across the variables and can cover many common distributions, such as Ising models, Gaussian MRFs, and mixed (heterogeneous) models. A distinct representation of the joint distribution allows for a compact representation of heterogeneous models and, eventually, a much faster structure/parameter learning method (O(p), compared to O(p), to learn a p node distribution, which has on the order of p unknown variables). After formally defining the model, we propose a method of learning its parameters. Because solving the exact maximum likelihood problem is computationally intractable in general high-dimensional settings, we extend an approach known as the approximated maximum likelihood, which previously has only been used for solving Ising models [2, 17]. This approach relies on deriving a tractable upper bound on the (intractable) log-partition function of the PE-MRF. We then show that the estimator can be simplified into a convex problem, minimizing the log-determinant divergence [15] plus a group sparsity penalty [7]. We call this the group graphical lasso for PE-MRFs, since it turns out to be a generalization of the well-known graphical lasso [6], a popular method of learning Gaussian MRFs. In other words, The graphical lasso is just a special case of our method, which is more generally able to reveal the Markov structure in heterogeneous settings. Furthermore, we prove that our method is sparsistent [15, 19], meaning that, under some mathematical assumptions, we are guaranteed to recover the true underlying Markov structure of the distribution. By converting the problem into the group graphical lasso, we are able to infer the structure in a scalable way. In contrast to the pseudo-likelihood, typically requiring Newton-type methods [3, 10, 16, 19], we develop an algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) [4], where we solve for closed-form updates for each of the ADMM subproblems. These fast updates speed up the solver and make ADMM more scalable than other methods. Finally, we test our approachâ€™s accuracy and scalability on both synthetic and real datasets.",2016,

An approach to new methods for digital signal processing on optical mapping sequences and electrical mapping,"Optical Mapping (OM) sequences represent a very useful tool for registering cardiac bioelectric activity with high patio-temporal resolution. Conventional preprocessing of OM movies is mostly done with spatio-temporal filters, which could be improved for yielding better signal to noise ratio in the processed images. Also, the multimodal mapping, such as electrical mapping combined with OM, is limited by the need of presence of catheters in the optical image. In this work, we addressed a twofold objective. First, we explored the suitability and scope of intrinsic multi-recording techniques to separate different noise sources in OM sequences. Second, we explored the use of advanced techniques to extrapolate the electrical mapping shadowed spatial regions on the OM images. We scrutinized the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on OM sequences obtained in OM laboratory, showing that: (1) the second spatial component mostly conveys movement artifacts, and could be removed or processed for improving the quality; (2) the components from 3 to about 10 convey both spatial variations and spatial artifacts, which can not be readily decoupled. The use of GPatt, an advanced algorithm for multidimensional pattern extrapolation based on Gaussian Processes, was also analyze in a multimodal recording of OM and electrical mapping including a lasso catheter, showing interesting capabilities for removing the catheter shadows with fidelity, and dependence with respect to noise and texture. Our results show that other processing methods can provide with enhanced signal to noise ratio when working with OM sequences.",2016,2016 Computing in Cardiology Conference (CinC)
Il perturbante eÌ€ lâ€™identitaÌ€ divisa Unâ€™interpretazione di Der Sandmann,"Il saggio di Freud sul perturbante ha offerto molti stimoli agli studi letterari e a quelli sul cinema: e stato commentato e discusso molte volte. Nella maggior parte dei casi, tuttavia, sembra essere stato letto frettolosamente: ci si e soffermati sulla tesi piu evidente, che stabilisce un nesso tra perturbante e angoscia di castrazione, e sono state trascurate le affermazioni relative al problema dellâ€™identita. Eppure, proprio in relazione a Der Sandmann Freud offre riflessioni di straordinaria importanza. Questo articolo si propone anzitutto di restituire al saggio di Freud la sua complessita: vengono messi in luce, ad esempio, i fraintendimenti e le forzature della critica femminista (Sarah Kof- man). E, soprattutto, propone una nuova interpretazione del racconto di Hoffmann, a partire dal concetto di â€˜ identita divisa â€™ . Lâ€™identita si dice in due modi fondamentali, la coincidenza e la non-coincidenza con se stessi. Ogni soggetto sperimenta il conflitto tra questi due modi. Nel racconto di Hoffmann, il prota- gonista (Nathaniel) viene trascinato al di la di se stesso, verso la fatale coincidenza con das Ding . E questa la fonte essenziale della sua angoscia. Der Sandmann e la storia di unâ€™attrazione inesora- bile, rallentata da entita che svolgono una funzione-schermo: nel rapporto con la bambola Olimpia emergono tutti i paradossi che determinano la fragile identita di Nathaniel. Poiche il perturbante appartiene al campo dellâ€™angoscia, non sarebbe stato possibile ignorare il Seminario X di Lacan, cosi come le riflessioni di Heidegger. Questâ€™articolo propone una revisione della concezione di Lacan: lâ€™angoscia piu devastante n on deriva tanto da un eccesso di presenza (cio che Lacan chiama Â«la mancanza della mancanzaÂ») quanto dallo svanire della non- coincidenza. Perturbante e la sensazione di un collasso logico-ontologico, a causa del quale il soggetto viene come incellofanato in se stesso, imprigionato nelle sue aporie.",2015,

"The role of self-efficacy factors, individual characteristics and WIL participation on accounting near-graduate studentsâ€™ employment outcomes","The issue of graduate employment has long been a focus in research, particularly in accounting education. Increasingly, higher education institutions promote this aspect to help them attract and retain high-quality students and maintain their competitive advantage in the market place. Given its importance, the present research analyses the association between the three self-efficacy factors of the general self-efficacy scale (GSES): initiative, effort and persistence on accounting near-graduate employment outcomes. Currently, no studies in accounting education have analysed this association in this context, so this research constitutes a contribution to the literature. Furthermore, there is limited research on the association of overall general self-efficacy (GSE) with accounting student employment outcomes. 
In addition to the three-factor GSES structure, the present study also includes studentsâ€™ individual characteristics (i.e., gender, age, residency, study mode and language), and WIL participation as potential factors impacting near-graduate accounting studentsâ€™ employment outcomes. Furthermore, the study also examines the potential association between the three factors of the GSES with studentsâ€™ participation in WIL programs during their degree course. 
The three-factor self-efficacy construct, based on a trait-like method, was adopted instead of the overall GSES structure, as the former approach enables a deeper analysis of the GSE concept via the employment of separate independent variables. Consequently, the importance of the individual factors and their impact on employment and WIL participation is clearly and distinctively revealed. 
The study sample consisted of 337 near-graduate accounting students from Victoria University and Swinburne University of Technology, both based in Melbourne, Australia. The research employed logistic regression, as well as Lasso and R-glmulti statistical techniques, to examine the main research questions. In addition, Mann-Whitney U tests and Pearson chi-square tests were conducted to examine the association between accounting studentsâ€™ individual characteristics (gender, age, residency, study mode and language) and the three factors of GSES (initiative, effort and persistence). 
The study results indicate that two out of the three GSES factors (specifically, initiative and persistence) showed a significant relationship with the employment outcomes of near-graduate accounting students. The study results also confirmed prior research findings, which found that individual characteristics (i.e., language, study mode, residency and age) were significantly associated with employment outcomes. Furthermore, the results showed no significant association between the three self-efficacy factors and studentsâ€™ WIL participation. 
The results of this study provide some important implications for accounting higher education with regard to improving the employment outcomes of accounting near-graduates. These include: (i) developing closer links with industry to improve student familiarity with workplace requirements; (ii) incorporating WIL programs into the accounting curriculum, such as in a professional degree program; (iii) tailoring parts of the curriculum, where possible, in order to improve student self-efficacy; (iv) promoting WIL and providingwider opportunities to access the program; and (v) examining the need for higher education reform to improve international student access to WIL participation during degree courses.",2018,

Stochastic Restricted LASSO-Type Estimator in the Linear Regression Model,"Among several variable selection methods, LASSO is the most desirable estimation procedure for handling regularization and variable selection simultaneously in the high-dimensional linear regression models when multicollinearity exists among the predictor variables. Since LASSO is unstable under high multicollinearity, the elastic-net (Enet) estimator has been used to overcome this issue. According to the literature, the estimation of regression parameters can be improved by adding prior information about regression coefficients to the model, which is available in the form of exact or stochastic linear restrictions. In this article, we proposed a stochastic restricted LASSO-type estimator (SRLASSO) by incorporating stochastic linear restrictions. Furthermore, we compared the performance of SRLASSO with LASSO and Enet in root mean square error (RMSE) criterion and mean absolute prediction error (MAPE) criterion based on a Monte Carlo simulation study. Finally, a real-world example was used to demonstrate the performance of SRLASSO.",2020,Journal of Probability and Statistics
A Comparison of Reproductive Strategies among Marine Snakes,"(1) Gravid females representing fourteen species of marine snakes were collected from four localities along the coast of Malaysia in 1975. The average clutch size ranged from 2.9 to 17.8 but most species had between three and seven young. The number of young produced and the size of gravid Lapemis hardwickii differed significantly at two sites in the Straits of Malacca. Eight species showed a significantly positive relationship between the number of oviducal eggs and female weight. The rate of infertility among ten species ranged from 4.5 to 20%. (2) Sex ratios in the collections varied significantly through time and between localities. Enhydrina schistosa and other species collected at Muar showed tightly synchronized annual reproductive cycles. Species at other localities appeared to have more loosely synchronized cycles. (3) A comparison of species in terms of clutch size, female weight and estimated birth weight revealed several distinct reproductive patterns that are considered in the context of r and K-selection. Hydrophisfasciatus is a small species that produced small clutches of medium sized young and it puts out the highest relative effort per embryo of any marine snake, 11%. Lapemis hardwickii and Thalassophina viperina are large snakes which have three or four very large young. Their relative effort per embryo is high, too. Enhydrina schistosa is the largest species studied and has many medium sized offspring. Its relative effort per embryo is the lowest of any marine snakes studied (2%). The remaining species make up a loose group that falls between the group T. viperina and L. hardwickii and E. schistosa in terms of effort per embryo. In general, these species have modest sized clutches and small female weights.",1981,Journal of Animal Ecology

Sparsity Promotion Models for the Choquet Integral,"In this paper, we present a novel algorithm for learning fuzzy measures for Choquet integration. There are two novel aspects of the algorithm: it seeks to explicitly reduce the number of nonzero parameters in the measure to eliminate noninformative or useless information sources and it uses a Bayesian model for parameter estimation which has not been previously applied to the fuzzy measure learning problem. The method uses a hierarchical model that implements a sparsity promotion algorithm through a Gibbs sampler. This approach builds on the methods proposed by Figueiredo et al which uses expectation maximization (EM) to maximize the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) criterion under a distribution that promotes sparsity. Additional constraints are needed to satisfy the requirements of fuzzy measures. Figueiredo's algorithm does not have a mechanism for imposing these constraints. The constraints are imposed by sequentially exploring the lattice tree of the power set and requiring that each fuzzy measure value assigned to a set lies in the domain of a truncated Gaussian determined by the fuzzy measures of supersets of the set under consideration",2007,2007 IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computational Intelligence
Preliminary Reviews to Interference of Second Language Learning caused by First Language and Culture,"Introduction Interference is one of the reasons why students have difficulty in learning a 2nd language. There are many different causes for interference and a couple of reasons have been thoroughly researched. One of the reasons is because of a studentâ€™s native or first language (or L1) (Bhela, 1999; Fewell, 2010; Galasso, 2002; Lim, 2010). Another reason for the interference is based on cultural background or norms of the student. This paper will examine several different literature reviews about how a studentâ€™s first language (L1) or cultural background and norms can cause interference in learning a second language.",2017,
Paleozoicâ€”mesozoic deposits of the PiauÃ­â€”MaranhÃ£o syneclise (Brazil): geological history of a sedimentary basin,"Abstract During Middle and Late Paleozoic and Early Mesozoic times the Piauiâ€”Maranhao syneclise was an area of continuous sedimentation. Between the Late Silurian and Early Carboniferous the basin passed through a thalassocratic phase, turning geocratic between the Late Carboniferous and Middle Triassic. Based upon sedimentary properties and fossil content, many sedimentary environments could be distinguished. During the thalassocratic phase, nearshore, submarine-fan, deltaic, tidal, coastal and alluvial-plain realms existed. During the geocratic phase the recognized realms are fluvial, lacustrine and semiarid to desertic, as well as offshore to nearshore due to a short marine invasion. The sedimentary history of the Piauiâ€”Maranhao syneclise showed itself to be rather simple, with a limited number of interacting environments. The marine phase started with a slow transgression, followed by a period of fluctuating sea level and finished with a fairly rapid regression. The sedimentary response was an alternation of clastic sediments of various grain sizes. During the geocratic phase the continental environments are chiefly differentiated by variations in climate, resulting in a sedimentary sequence which presents besides variously sized clastics, also limestones and evaporites. These ancient environments have been compared with recent ones, leading to the conclusion that the climatic evolution was very important. The climate during the period of deposition changed slowly from boreal through temperate and desertic, to almost tropical, confirmed by the character of the sediments and the biota assemblage.",1977,Sedimentary Geology
Improved Insight into and Prediction of Network Dynamics by Combining VAR and Dimension Reduction.,"To understand within-person psychological processes, one may fit VAR(1) models (or continuous-time variants thereof) to multivariate time series and display the VAR(1) coefficients as a network. This approach has two major problems. First, the contemporaneous correlations between the variables will frequently be substantial, yielding multicollinearity issues. In addition, the shared effects of the variables are not included in the network. Consequently, VAR(1) networks can be hard to interpret. Second, crossvalidation results show that the highly parametrized VAR(1) model is prone to overfitting. In this article, we compare the pros and cons of two potential solutions to both problems. The first is to impose a lasso penalty on the VAR(1) coefficients, setting some of them to zero. The second, which has not yet been pursued in psychological network analysis, uses principal component VAR(1) (termed PC-VAR(1)). In this approach, the variables are first reduced to a few principal components, which are rotated toward simple structure; then VAR(1) analysis (or a continuous-time analog) is applied to the rotated components. Reanalyzing the data of a single participant of the COGITO study, we show that PC-VAR(1) has the better predictive performance and that networks based on PC-VAR(1) clearly represent both the lagged and the contemporaneous variable relations.",2018,Multivariate behavioral research
Model selection and estimation in regression with grouped variables,"Summary. We consider the problem of selecting grouped variables (factors) for accurate prediction in regression. Such a problem arises naturally in many practical situations with the multifactor analysis-of-variance problem as the most important and well-known example. Instead of selecting factors by stepwise backward elimination, we focus on the accuracy of estimation and consider extensions of the lasso, the LARS algorithm and the non-negative garrotte for factor selection. The lasso, the LARS algorithm and the non-negative garrotte are recently proposed regression methods that can be used to select individual variables. We study and propose efficient algorithms for the extensions of these methods for factor selection and show that these extensions give superior performance to the traditional stepwise backward elimination method in factor selection problems. We study the similarities and the differences between these methods. Simulations and real examples are used to illustrate the methods.",2006,Journal of The Royal Statistical Society Series B-statistical Methodology
Baseline Levels of Influenza-Specific CD4 Memory T-Cells Affect T-Cell Responses to Influenza Vaccines,"BACKGROUND
Factors affecting immune responses to influenza vaccines have not been studied systematically. We hypothesized that T-cell and antibody responses to the vaccines are functions of pre-existing host immunity against influenza antigens.


METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS
During the 2004 and 2005 influenza seasons, we have collected data on cellular and humoral immune reactivity to influenza virus in blood samples collected before and after immunization with inactivated or live attenuated influenza vaccines in healthy children and adults. We first used cross-validated lasso regression on the 2004 dataset to identify a group of candidate baseline correlates with T-cell and antibody responses to vaccines, defined as fold-increase in influenza-specific T-cells and serum HAI titer after vaccination. The following baseline parameters were examined: percentages of influenza-reactive IFN-gamma(+) cells in T and NK cell subsets, percentages of influenza-specific memory B-cells, HAI titer, age, and type of vaccine. The candidate baseline correlates were then tested with the independent 2005 dataset. Baseline percentage of influenza-specific IFN-gamma(+) CD4 T-cells was identified as a significant correlate of CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses, with lower baseline levels associated with larger T-cell responses. Baseline HAI titer and vaccine type were identified as significant correlates for HAI response, with lower baseline levels and the inactivated vaccine associated with larger HAI responses. Previously we reported that baseline levels of CD56(dim) NK reactivity against influenza virus inversely correlated with the immediate T-cell response to vaccination, and that NK reactivity induced by influenza virus depended on IL-2 produced by influenza-specific memory T-cells. Taken together these results suggest a novel mechanism for the homeostasis of virus-specific T-cells, which involves interaction between memory helper T-cells, CD56(dim) NK and DC.


SIGNIFICANCE
These results demonstrate that assessment of baseline biomarkers may predict immunologic outcome of influenza vaccination and may reveal some of the mechanisms responsible for variable immune responses following vaccination and natural infection.",2008,PLoS ONE
Predicting poor response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced rectal cancer: Model constructed using pre-treatment MRI features of structured report template.,"PURPOSE
To develop a predictive model with pre-treatment magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of the structured report template and clinical parameters for poor responses prediction after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (neoCRT) in locally advanced rectal cancers (LARC) patients.


METHOD
Patients with clinicopathologically confirmed LARC (training and validation datasets, nâ€¯=â€¯100 and 71, respectively) were enrolled. Patients' clinical data were retrospectively collected. MRI findings of the structured report template were analysed. The tumour regression grade (TRG) system as proposed by Mandard et al was used. Poor response was defined as TRG 3-5. Univariate logistic regression analysis and a lasso regression model were performed to select the significant predictive features from the training set. A nomogram was constructed based on a multivariable logistic regression analysis. Calibration, discrimination, and clinical usefulness of the nomogram were assessed. The calibrative and discriminative ability of our model were compared with those of models including the tumour-node-metastasis (TNM) stage and clinical factors.


RESULTS
The MRI-reported T4b stage, MRI-reported extramural venous invasion (EMVI) positivity, MRI-detected number of positive mesorectal lymph nodes (LNs)â€¯>â€¯0, and preoperative oxaliplatin and capecitabine (CAPOX) chemotherapy regimen were incorporated into our nomogram. The nomogram showed good discrimination, with areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of 0Â·823 and 0Â·820 in the training and test sets, respectively, and good calibration in both datasets. The decision curve analysis confirmed that the nomogram was clinically useful. The calibrative and discriminative ability of our model were better than those models including the TNM stage and clinical factors.


CONCLUSION
A nomogram based on pre-treatment MRI features of the structured report template and clinical risk factors has potential for use as a non-invasive tool to preoperatively predict poor responses in LARC patients after neoCRT.",2020,Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology
Preprint Reference Generalized and smooth James-Stein model selection,"The generalized and smooth James-Stein thresholding functions link and extend the thresholding functions employed by the James-Stein estimator, the blockand adaptive-lasso in variable selection, and the soft-, hardand block-thresholding in wavelet smoothing. The estimator is indexed by two hyperparameters for more flexibility and a smoothness parameter for better estimation of its l2-risk with the Stein unbiased risk estimate (SURE). For blocks of a fixed size, a situation that arises when observing concomitant signals (e.g., gravitational wave bursts), we derive a universal threshold, an information criterion and an oracle inequality for block thresholding. Smooth James-Stein thresholding can also be employed in parametric regression for variable selection. In that case a unique smooth estimate is defined, its smooth SURE is derived, which provides the equivalent degrees of freedom of adaptive lasso as a side result. The new estimator enjoys smoothness like ridge regression and performs variable selection like lasso. SARDY, Sylvain. Generalized and smooth James-Stein model selection. 2010",2017,

Selecting Landmark Points for Sparse Manifold Learning,"There has been a surge of interest in learning non-linear manifold models to approximate high-dimensional data. Both for computational complexity reasons and for generalization capability, sparsity is a desired feature in such models. This usually means dimensionality reduction, which naturally implies estimating the intrinsic dimension, but it can also mean selecting a subset of the data to use as landmarks, which is especially important because many existing algorithms have quadratic complexity in the number of observations. This paper presents an algorithm for selecting landmarks, based on LASSO regression, which is well known to favor sparse approximations because it uses regularization with an l1 norm. As an added benefit, a continuous manifold parameterization, based on the landmarks, is also found. Experimental results with synthetic and real data illustrate the algorithm.",2005,
Multi-level Lasso for Sparse Multi-task Regression,"We present a flexible formulation for variable selection in multi-task regression to allow for discrepancies in the estimated sparsity patterns accross the multiple tasks, while leveraging the common structure among them. Our approach is based on an intuitive decomposition of the regression coe_cients into a product between a component that is common to all tasks and another component that captures task-specificity. This decomposition yields the Multi-level Lasso objective that can be solved efficiently via alternating optimization. The analysis of the ""orthonormal design"" case reveals some interesting insights on the nature of the shrinkage performed by our method, compared to that of related work. Theoretical guarantees are provided on the consistency of Multi-level Lasso. Simulations and empirical study of micro-array data further demonstrate the value of our framework.",2012,

Adaptive LASSO-type estimation for ergodic diffusion processes,"The LASSO is a widely used statistical methodology for simultaneous estimation and variable selection. In the last years, many authors analyzed this technique from a theoretical and applied point of view.

Our theoretical framework is based on the random field approach and it applied to more general families of regular statistical experiments in the sense of Ibragimov-Hasminskii (1981). Furthermore, we perform a simulation and real data analysis to provide some evidence on the applicability of this method.",2010,arXiv: Statistics Theory
optimal procedures in high-dimensional variable selection,"Motivated by the recent trend in ``Big data"", we are interested in the case where both $p$, the number of variables, and $n$, the number of subjects are large, and probably $p \gg n$. When $p \gg n$, the signals are usually rare and weak, and the observation units are correlated in a complicated way. When the signals are rare and weak, it may be hard to recover them individually. In this thesis, we are interested in the problem of recovering the rare and weak signals with the assistance of correlation structure of the data. 
 
We consider the helps from two types of correlation structures, the correlation structure of the observed units, and the dependency among the unobserved factors. In Chapter \ref{chapter:gs}, in a setting of high dimensional linear regression, we study the variable selection problem when the observed predictors are correlated. In Chapter \ref{chapter:gmas}, we consider recovering the sparse mean vector of a Stein's normal means model, where the elements of the unobserved mean vector are dependent through an Ising model. In each chapter, we study the optimality in variable selection, discover the non-optimality of the conventional methods such as the lasso, subset selection and hard thresholding, and propose {\it Screen and Clean} type of variable selection procedures which are optimal in terms of the Hamming distance. The theoretical findings is supported by the simulation results and applications.",2013,
Cardiac big vein electrical isolation by radiofrequency catheter ablation for the treatment of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation,"Objective The effects of cardiac big vein electrical isolation to treat paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) were reviewed. Methods 83 patients [age (60 5Â±18 5) years, 58 males, 25 females] were referred for vein electrical islation by radiofrequency catheter ablation to treat drug refractory PAF were studied. Guided by circular mapping catheter (Lasso catheter), radiofequency lesions were applied around the circumference of the cardiac big veins at the ostia until the complete electrical disconnections between the atria and veins developed. Results Successful electrical isolation was obtained in th 343 cardiac big veins of 83 pantients, including 83 LSPV and 83 RSPVs and 82 LIPVs and 42 RIPVs and 53 SVCs. After a follow up of 2ï½ž31 months, 50 patients remained free of PAF without medication, and another 13 patients experienced remarkable reduction of PAF episodes. Complications occurred in 23 patients, including in 2 hemothorax, 21 pulmonary vein stenosis. Conclusion (1) The cardiac big veins could be successfully electrically disconnected from atria through radiofrequency catheter ablation techniqe in patients with PAF, the recurrence of PAF can be controlled or cured in more than 75% of patients; (2)The all cardiac big veins be successfully electrically disconnected may increase success rate; (3)The complications should be carefully avoided during the procedure.",2004,Chinese Journal of Cardiac Arrhythmias
Lesiones y patologÃ­as de la Facultad de Farmacia de la Universidad de Salamanca,"The building of the Faculty of Pharmacy was designed by Julio Cano Lasso and Ignacio Mendaro and it is considered a remarkable work within the Spanish rationalist architecture; however, the last few years its worsening has been revealed for all those who perform daily activities within its walls. The aim of this work is the analysis, classification and evaluation of the observed pathologies origin, being conscious of its severity and preventing the occurrence of future injuries. The pathologies were identified in situ by data observation and collection and its rear organisation according to the premises on rehabilitation issues (type, orientation, level of exposure ...) established by the Colegio de Arquitectos de Madrid . According to the obtained results, it can be concluding that that the most relevant pathologies are located on the facades with greater exposure to sunlight (south-east), growing vertically and/or having been caused by direct causes, among which humidity could be highlighted. Although most of the pathologies do not compromise the safety of individuals, it does cause problems of healthiness and comfort, which can hinder the normal development of the activities for which the building was conceived.",2018,

On the Ovuliferous Organ of Hirmerella,"Mesozoic brachyphyllous plants which produced the Classopollis-type pollen grains have been conventionally assigned to the extinct family of conifers, Hirmerellaceae. It is shown that ovules in Hirmerella were enclosed in a cuticle-lined locule within the thick walled samaras. The double cuticle (locular + integumental) and nucelli are described in detail. The nucelli lack definite beaks or pollen chambers. These ovuliferous organs are compared with Araucaria, Caytonia, and Leptostrobus. It is suggested that Hirmerella and its allies stand apart from true conifers.",1982,

Model selection and prediction of outcomes in recent onset schizophrenia patients who undergo cognitive training,"Predicting treatment outcomes in psychiatric populations remains a challenge, but is increasingly important in the pursuit of personalized medicine. Patients with schizophrenia have deficits in cognition, and targeted cognitive training (TCT) of auditory processing and working memory has been shown to improve some of these impairments; but little is known about the baseline patient characteristics predictive of cognitive improvement. Here we use a model selection and regression approach called least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) to examine predictors of cognitive improvement in response to TCT for patients with recent onset schizophrenia. Forty-three individuals with recent onset schizophrenia randomized to undergo TCT were assessed at baseline on measures of cognition, symptoms, functioning, illness duration, and demographic variables. We carried out 10-fold cross-validation of LASSO for model selection and regression. We followed up on these results using linear models for statistical inference. No individual variable was found to correlate with improvement in global cognition using a Pearson correlation approach, and a linear model including all variables was also found not to be significant. However, the LASSO model identified baseline global cognition, education, and gender in a model predictive of improvement on global cognition following TCT. These findings offer guidelines for personalized approaches to cognitive training for patients with schizophrenia.",2018,Schizophrenia Research: Cognition
An Integrated Causal Path Identification Method,"Finding causality merely from observed data is a fundamental problem in science. The most basic form of this causal problem is to determine whether X leads to Y or Y leads to X in the case of joint observation of two variables X, Y. In statistics, path analysis is used to describe the direct dependence between a set of variables. But in fact, we usually do not know the causal order between variables. However, ignoring the direction of the causal path will prevent researchers from analyzing or using causal models. In this study, we propose a method for estimating causality based on observed data. First, observed variables are cleaned and valid variables are retained. Then, a direct linear non-Gaussian acyclic graph models (DirectLiNGAM) estimates the causal order K between variables. The third step is to estimate the adjacency matrix B of the causal relationship based on K. Next, since B is not convenient for model interpretation, we use adaptive lasso to prune the causal path and variables. Further, a causal path graph and a recursive model are established. Finally, we test and debug the recursive model, obtain a causal model with good fit, and estimate the direct, indirect and total effects between causal variables. This paper overcomes the randomness assigning causal order to variables. This study is different from the researcherâ€™s understanding of his own model by generating some form of simulation data. The simplest and relatively unsmooth statistical learning method used in this study has obvious advantages in the field of interpretable machine learning.",2019,Wuhan University Journal of Natural Sciences
Independently Interpretable Lasso: A New Regularizer for Sparse Regression with Uncorrelated Variables,"Sparse regularization such as $\ell_1$ regularization is a quite powerful and widely used strategy for high dimensional learning problems. The effectiveness of sparse regularization have been supported practically and theoretically by several studies. However, one of the biggest issues in sparse regularization is that its performance is quite sensitive to correlations between features. Ordinary $\ell_1$ regularization often selects variables correlated with each other, which results in deterioration of not only its generalization error but also interpretability. In this paper, we propose a new regularization method, ""Independently Interpretable Lasso"" (IILasso for short). Our proposed regularizer suppresses selecting correlated variables, and thus each active variables independently affect the objective variable in the model. Hence, we can interpret regression coefficients intuitively and also improve the performance by avoiding overfitting. We analyze theoretical property of IILasso and show that the proposed method is much advantageous for its sign recovery and achieves almost minimax optimal convergence rate. Synthetic and real data analyses also indicate the effectiveness of IILasso.",2018,
Essays on Robust Model Selection and Model Averaging for Linear Models,"Model selection is central to all applied statistical work. Selecting the variables for use in a regression model is one important example of model selection. This thesis is a collection of essays on robust model selection procedures and model averaging for linear regression models. In the first essay, we propose robust Akaike information criteria (AIC) for MMestimation and an adjusted robust scale based AIC for M and MM-estimation. Our proposed model selection criteria can maintain their robust properties in the presence of a high proportion of outliers and the outliers in the covariates. We compare our proposed criteria with other robust model selection criteria discussed in previous literature. Our simulation studies demonstrate a significant outperformance of robust AIC based on MM-estimation in the presence of outliers in the covariates. The real data example also shows a better performance of robust AIC based on MM-estimation. The second essay focuses on robust versions of the â€œLeast Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operatorâ€ (lasso). The adaptive lasso is a method for performing simultaneous parameter estimation and variable selection. The adaptive weights used in its penalty term mean that the adaptive lasso achieves the oracle property. In this essay, we propose an extension of the adaptive lasso named the Tukeylasso. By using Tukeyâ€™s biweight criterion, instead of squared loss, the Tukeylasso is resistant to outliers in both the response and covariates. Importantly, we demonstrate that the Tukey-lasso also enjoys the oracle property. A fast accelerated proximal gradient (APG) algorithm is proposed and implemented for",2017,

Genome-wide association study of Hirschsprung disease detects a novel low-frequency variant at the RET locus,"Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is a congenital disorder with a population incidence of ~1/5000 live births, defined by an absence of enteric ganglia along variable lengths of the colon. HSCR genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have found common associated variants at RET, SEMA3, and NRG1, but they still fail to explain all of its heritability. To enhance gene discovery, we performed a GWAS of 170 cases identified from the Danish nationwide pathology registry with 4717 controls, based on 6.2 million variants imputed from the haplotype reference consortium panel. We found a novel low-frequency variant (rs144432435), which, when conditioning on the lead RET single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), was of genome-wide significance in the discovery analysis. This conditional association signal was replicated in a Swedish HSCR cohort with discovery plus replication meta-analysis conditional odds ratio of 6.6 (Pâ€‰=â€‰7.7â€‰Ã—â€‰10âˆ’10; 322 cases and 4893 controls). The conditional signal was, however, not replicated in two HSCR cohorts from USA and Finland, leading to the hypothesis that rs144432435 tags a rare haplotype present in Denmark and Sweden. Using the genome-wide complex trait analysis method, we estimated the SNP heritability of HSCR to be 88%, close to estimates based on classical family studies. Moreover, by using Lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) regression we were able to construct a genetic HSCR predictor with a area under the receiver operator characteristics curve of 76% in an independent validation set. In conclusion, we combined the largest collection of sporadic Hirschsprung cases to date (586 cases) to further elucidate HSCRâ€™s genetic architecture.",2017,European Journal of Human Genetics

A Data-driven Fault Prediction Integrated Design Scheme Based on Ensemble Learning for Thermal Boiler Process,"As modern industrial systems are becoming more and more sophisticated, the reliability and safety issues of these complex industrial systems have become the most critical parts in system design. Data-driven fault diagnosis and fault prediction technology play important roles in the field of fault prediction and health management of complex industrial systems. This paper studies the machine learning aided data-driven fault prediction techniques. Three kinds of machine learning algorithms, i.e. random forest (RF), lasso regression (Lasso) and support vector machine regression (SVR), are employed to predict the fault related key performance indicator (KPI) of the thermal boiler system. The boiler's monitoring data is preprocessed, after which the characteristic variables are selected with the algorithm of RF and support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE). The stacking algorithm is finally used to combine the three basic models. The proposed prediction model performs much better in fault prognosis in comparison with the original prediction model.",2020,2020 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology (ICIT)

At-Sea Distribution and Prey Selection of Antarctic Petrels and Commercial Krill Fisheries,"Commercial fisheries may impact marine ecosystems and affect populations of predators like seabirds. In the Southern Ocean, there is an extensive fishery for Antarctic krill Euphausia superba that is projected to increase further. Comparing distribution and prey selection of fishing operations versus predators is needed to predict fishery-related impacts on krill-dependent predators. In this context, it is important to consider not only predators breeding near the fishing grounds but also the ones breeding far away and that disperse during the non-breeding season where they may interact with fisheries. In this study, we first quantified the overlap between the distribution of the Antarctic krill fisheries and the distribution of a krill dependent seabird, the Antarctic petrel Thalassoica antarctica, during both the breeding and non-breeding season. We tracked birds from the world biggest Antarctic petrel colony (Svarthamaren, Dronning Maud Land), located >1000 km from the main fishing areas, during three consecutive seasons. The overall spatial overlap between krill fisheries and Antarctic petrels was limited but varied greatly among and within years, and was high in some periods during the non-breeding season. In a second step, we described the length frequency distribution of Antarctic krill consumed by Antarctic petrels, and compared this with results from fisheries, as well as from diet studies in other krill predators. Krill taken by Antarctic petrels did not differ in size from that taken by trawls or from krill taken by most Antarctic krill predators. Selectivity for specific Antarctic krill stages seems generally low in Antarctic predators. Overall, our results show that competition between Antarctic petrels and krill fisheries is currently likely negligible. However, if krill fisheries are to increase in the future, competition with the Antarctic petrel may occur, even with birds breeding thousands of kilometers away.",2016,PLoS ONE
Learning methods in reproducing kernel Hilbert space based on high-dimensional features,"Hojin Yang: Learning Methods in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space Based on High-dimensional Features (Under the direction of Joseph G. Ibrahim and Hongtu Zhu) The first topic focuses on the dimension reduction method via the regularization. We propose the selection for principle components via LASSO. This method assumes that some unknown latent variables are related to the response under the highly correlate covariates structure. L1 regularization plays a key role in adaptively finding a few liner combinations in contrast to the persistent idea that is to employ a few leading principal components. The consistency of regression coefficients and selected model are asymptotically proved and numerical performances are shown to support our suggestion. The proposed method is applied to analyze microarray data and cancer data. Second and third topics focus on the approaches of the independent screening and the dimension reduction with the machine learning approach using positive definite kernels. A Key ingredient matter of these papers is to use reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) theory. Specifically, we proposed Multiple Projection Model (MPM) and Single Index Latent Factor Model (SILFM) to build an accurate prediction model for clinical outcomes based on a massive number of features. MPM and SILFM can be summarized as three-stage estimation, screening, dimension reduction, and nonlinear fitting. Screening and dimension reduction are unique approaches of two novel methods. The convergence property of the proposed screening method and the risk bound for SILFM are systematically investigated. The results from several simulation scenarios are shown to support it. The proposed method is applied to analyze brain image data and its clinical behavior response.",2016,

Late Bronze Age Mycenaean and Italic products in the West Mediterranean : a social and economic analysis,"Aegean-type pottery has been found in the West Mediterranean for more than a century and several publications have tried to explain the phenomenon from an Aegeancentric point of view. The search for metals, the arrival of Mycenaean people after the LH III B destructions in Mainland Greece and the hypothesis that Mycenaeans had to sail westwards because of the dominance of the Minoan thalassocracy on the eastern routes are only some of the proposals. Yet, what do we know about the Italics, the people who consumed, and eventually produced, Aegean-type pottery? This question is at the centre of this study. The state of research on this topic, in spite of almost a century and a half of studies is disappointing. The phenomenon is still seen in terms of economic exchange, where the Aegeans are the primary players. There has been no attempt to research methodically the reasons why the Italics accepted and used Aegean-type pottery. In the last few decades, many anthropologists have concentrated their efforts on ethnographic studies of patterns of consumption and several theoretical models have been published as a result. In particular, globalisation has provided the stimulus for research focussed on cross-cultural consumption of standardised products. Using these studies, this research has tried to provide the Italic perspective, one of consumption as well as production. The results of this research demonstrate the independence of the Italics in their choices as consumers and provide insights on the social and cultural processes of these Bronze Age populations. As a result, while the role of the Aegeans in the phenomenon appears less important, the complexity of the regional Italic processes associated with the presence of Aegean-type pottery in the West Mediterranean becomes more apparent.",2005,
"Anaphylaxis induced by Thalassophryne nattereri venom in mice is an IgE/IgG1-mediated, IL-4-dependent phenomenon","We hypothesized that beyond the Thalassophryne nattereri venoms ability to induce in mice a strong specific-Th2 response with high levels of specific IgE/IgG1, it would be able to trigger anaphylaxis in sensitized individuals. To investigate whether the venom is capable of inducing an allergic reaction in mice and characterize soluble and cellular mediators involved in this process, BALB/c female mice were sensitized intraperitoneally with decreasing-dose of venom at weekly intervals for 4 weeks and challenged by intraperitoneal, oral or epicutaneous routes with venom 2 weeks later. Our data show that sensitized-mice challenged by all routes showed intense symptoms of anaphylaxis, dependent on the anaphylactic IgG1 and IgE antibodies and mast cells. The late-phase reaction developed after initial symptoms was characterized by the influx of eosinophils, dependent on IL-5, IL-17A and eotaxin produced by Th2 cells in inflamed lungs and skin draining lymph-nodes. Using C57BL/6 deficient mice we demonstrated that IL-4 KO mice failed to develop anaphylactic symptoms or local Th2 inflammation, producing low levels of IgG1 and increased levels of IgG2a. Together our results demonstrated that the venom of T. nattereri has allergenic proteins that can trigger an allergic process, a phenomenon IgE-IgG1 dependent, IL-4-mediated and negatively regulated by IFN-Î³.",2020,Scientific Reports
"To Garden, to Market: Gendered meanings of work on an African urban periphery","This article traces the historical origins of a localized gender division of labor found in two villages on the edge of the city of Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso. Through social-historical analysis, this article demonstrates that gender divisions of labor are not simply constructed in particular places; they are constructs located near or far from other places, and thus influenced by multidimensional interactions between those places. Specifically, this article shows how the villages' location on the periphery of an important regional city has shaped their experience of European colonialism, religious change and market expansion in ways that have given particular meanings to certain kinds of work in commercial gardening. More generally, this article shows how a focus on the historical meanings of work can provide insights into local variations in gender divisions of labor.",2001,"Gender, Place & Culture"
A Robust Framework For Eigenspace Image Reconstruction,"Principal components analysis (PCA) is proved to be a useful tool for many computer vision and signal processing problems. One drawback of traditional PCA is that they are based on least squares estimation techniques and hence fail to account for ""outliers"" which commonly occurs in realistic training sets. To make PCA more robust to real-world problems such as image reconstruction addressed in this paper, we develop a two-step algorithm that can eliminate the outliers on both frame level and pixel level through the LASSO and RPCA separately. With LASSO optimization method, we may obtain sparse projected coefficients of the original image into the basis image space. According to the sparsity of these coefficients, sample outliers can be recognized automatically. Then, with the use of robust M-estimation, the influence of intra-sample outliers may be overwhelmed to great extent. Additionally, due to orthogonality of the principal components, the soft-threshold estimation can be applied to the LASSO to alleviate the computational costs, hence make our robust PCA method more applicable to large-scale problems. An experiment on object image reconstruction is used to illustrate the advantage of our proposed technique over standard PCA",2005,2005 Seventh IEEE Workshops on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV/MOTION'05) - Volume 1
Editorial: Recent Advances in Sparse Statistical Modeling,"The first term L(Î²) is a loss function and the second term Î» âˆ‘p j=1 |Î²j | is a penalty term. Here Î» (Î» > 0) is a tuning parameter which controls the sparsity and the model fitting. Because the penalty term consists of the sum of absolute values of the parameter, we can carry out the sparse estimation, that is, some of the elements of Î² are estimated by exactly zeros. It is well-known that we cannot often obtain the analytical solutions of the minimization problem (1), because the penalty term Î» âˆ‘p j=1 |Î²j | is indifferentiable when Î²j = 0 (j = 1, . . . , p). Therefore, it is important to develop efficient computational algorithms. This special issue includes six interesting papers related to sparse estimation. These papers cover a wide variety of topics, such as statistical modeling, computation, theoretical analysis, and applications. In particular, all of the papers deal with the issue of statistical computation. Kawasaki and Ueki (the first paper of this issue) apply smooth-threshold estimating equations (STEE, Ueki, 2009) to telemarketing success data collected from a Portuguese retail bank. In STEE, the penalty term consists of a quadratic form âˆ‘p j=1 wjÎ² 2 j instead of âˆ‘p j=1 |Î²j |, where wj (j = 1, . . . , p) are positive values allowed to be âˆž, so that we do not need to implement a computational algorithm that is used in the L1 regularization. Kawano, Hoshina, Shimamura and Konishi (the second paper) propose a model selection criterion for choosing tuning parameters in the Bayesian lasso (Park and Casella, 2008). They use an efficient sparse estimation algorithm in the Bayesian lasso, referred to as the sparse algorithm. Matsui (the third paper) considers the problem of bi-level selection, which allows the selection of groups of variables and individuals simultaneously. The parameter estimation procedure is based on the coordinate descent algorithm, which is known as a remarkably fast algorithm (Friedman et al., 2010). Suzuki (the fourth paper) focuses attention on the alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm (ADMM algorithm, Boyd et al., 2011), which is applicable to various complex penalties such as the overlapping group lasso (Jacob et al., 2009). He reviews a stochastic version of the ADMM algorithm that allows the online learning. Hino and Fujiki (the fifth paper) propose a penalized linear discriminant analysis that adheres to the normal discriminant model. They apply the Majorize-Minimization algorithm (MM algorithm, Hunter and Lange 2004), which is often used to replace a non-convex optimization problem with a reweighted convex optimization",2015,Journal of the Japanese Society of Computational Statistics
Breast cancer Ki-67 expression prediction by digital breast tomosynthesis radiomics features,"BackgroundTo investigate whether quantitative radiomic features extracted from digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) are associated with Ki-67 expression of breast cancer.Materials and methodsThis is a prospective ethically approved study of 70 women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer in 2018, including 40 low Ki-67 expression (Ki-67 proliferation index <14%) cases and 30 high Ki-67 expression (Ki-67 proliferation index â‰¥â€‰14%) cases. A set of 106 quantitative radiomic features, including morphological, grey/scale statistics, and texture features, were extracted from DBT images. After applying least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method to select the most predictive features set for the classifiers, low versus high Ki-67 expression was evaluated by the area under the curve (AUC) at receiver operating characteristic analysis. Correlation coefficient was calculated for the most significant features.ResultsA combination of five features yielded AUC of up to 0.698. The five most predictive features (sphericity, autocorrelation, interquartile range, robust mean absolute deviation, and short-run high grey-level emphasis) showed a statistical significance (p â‰¤ 0.001) in the classification. Thirty-four features were significantly (p â‰¤ 0.001) correlated with Ki-67, and five of these had a correlation coefficient of >â€‰0.5.ConclusionThe present study showed that quantitative radiomic imaging features of breast tumour extracted from DBT images are associated with breast cancer Ki-67 expression.

Recovery conditions and sampling strategies for network Lasso,"The network Lasso is a recently proposed convex optimization method for machine learning from massive network structured datasets, i.e., big data over networks. It is a variant of the well-known least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso), which is underlying many methods in learning and signal processing involving sparse models. Highly scalable implementations of the network Lasso can be obtained by state-of-the-art proximal methods, e.g., the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). By generalizing the concept of the compatibility condition put forward by van de Geer and Buhlmann as a powerful tool for the analysis of plain Lasso, we derive a sufficient condition, i.e., the network compatibility condition, on the underlying network topology such that network Lasso accurately learns a clustered underlying graph signal. This network compatibility condition relates the location of sampled nodes with the clustering structure of the network. In particular, the NCC informs the choice of which nodes to sample, or in machine learning terms, which data points provide most information if labeled.",2017,"2017 51st Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers"
Lowland Scots: An ambivalent national tongue,"At the peak of its independent development in the late mediaeval period, and still today in its most conservative forms. Lowland Scots is sufficiently unlike Standard English to be classifiable as a distinct language. However, it has never been generally recognised as such, nor has the maintenance of it been commonly seen as essential to Scottish national identity. The sociolinguistic conflict between Lowland Scots and Scottish Standard English, in which the former has steadily lost ground, has not been typically perceived as one between two national languages, but as between 'good' and 'bad' speech. Countering this, some people from the early sixteenth century to the present day have vigorously insisted that 'Scots' is or ought to be a national language and attempted to promote it as such: a notable outcome of this has been the remarkable efflorescence of poetry in literary Scots in recent decades. Widespread popular confusion regarding the true historic origin and nature of Lowland Scots, particularly the recently developed urban dialects, has not (yet?) been dispelled by the efforts of scholars and writers to promote the tongue in the social and cultural fields. A readily observable sociolinguistic fact of Scottish life is that many inhabitants of the country speak something which is neither Standard English, Gaelic, nor any immigrant language. This variety, or these varieties, of speech have come to be the object of a growing, if still not large, amount of scholarly interest: the linguistic features of the Scottish vernacular, its historic and sociolinguistic aspects, and its use in literature, have been examined in a number of published studies. Yet the Scottish linguistic situation remains confused and confusing, because of a disconcertingly wide range of attitudes to, and perceptions of, the indigenous speech. The present article will attempt to give some account of the historical reasons for this confusion, to distinguish facts from misconceptions in popular notions regarding the tongue, to examine its contemporary range of uses, and briefly to discuss possible future developments. The ambiguous status of the speech-form is demonstrated by the fact that there is no name for it which can be used without the need for explanation or the risk of controversy. Aitken (1981), only half jocularly, produces a list of labels, some of which are clearly subjective (to support his argument that the distinctive identity of this speech form is largely imaginary): 'Scots, our own tongue, our own language, our native language, our own dialect, broad Scots, Lallans, the Scots or Scottish tongue, the good Scots tongue, the old Scottish tongue, good old Scots, the Scots language and no doubt other terms I have forgotten' (1981:79). For the present essay, the writer chooses what appears to be a reasonably neutral descriptive term: Lowland Scots, the native tongue of the Lowlands of Scotland as contrasted with the Gaelic speech of the Highlands. (On Highlands as a linguistic term, see Speitel 1981 and references therein.) 'Lallans' is simply the native cognate of'Lowlands', used in a poetic and argumentative context by Robert Burns (1759-96) to refer to his own language â€” They took nae pains their speech to balance. Or rules to gie, But spak their thoughts in plain, braid Lallans, Like you or me.

Derrick McChirc â€” and recently revived (not without controversy) as a label for the highly literary medium employed, with striking success, by the culturally nationalistic poets of the present century. Historically, the origins of Lowland Scots are clear. Like Standard English, it is ultimately derived from Anglo-Saxon, but from the Northumbrian rather than the Mercian dialect: it therefore shares some features with the dialects of Northern England, and was in fact scarcely distinguishable from those, except by orthography and to a limited extent vocabulary, until the fifteenth century. Whereas the dialects of the region between Humber and Tweed had lost their independent literary status by the end of the Middle English period, the Scottish forms continued to enjoy an autonomous existence as the language of government and administration in the Kingdom of Scotland. Lowland Scots was also the vehicle of a copious and brilliant literature. The highly inventive and imaginative use by poets of all registers of the language, from the most vulgar of colloquialisms to the most fanciful and exotic of aureations (see Aitken 1983) had raised it to the status of a literary medium unsurpassed in Europe for expressive power. Neither linguistically nor culturally, however, is the Lowland Scots of today equivalent to that of the fifteenth and earlier sixteenth centuries. The change was not, in the first instance, in the language itself (though it laid the language open to changes of various kinds), but in the attitude of its speakers. Gradually but inexorably, in the course of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the English of the London aristocracy came to be accepted as a linguistic standard in Scotland, and Lowland Scots lost its status as the accepted speech-form used for all purposes and by all classes in the non-Gaelic regions of the country. Of course, the tongue did not disappear â€” nor has it yet, though predictions of its imminent demise have been fashionable since at least the later eighteenth century. The speech-form used by King James VI (1567-1625) and his subjects simply continued, and generation after generation of children grew up with it as their mother tongue. But whereas formerly the use of Lowland Scots had been natural and unconsidered, it was now seen by an influential and increasingly numerous section of the population as undesirable: the Scottish dialects were for people who were insufficiently refined or literate to speak quasi-Metropolitan English.

Group Lasso for high dimensional sparse quantile regression models,"This paper studies the statistical properties of the group Lasso estimator for high dimensional sparse quantile regression models where the number of explanatory variables (or the number of groups of explanatory variables) is possibly much larger than the sample size while the number of variables in ""active"" groups is sufficiently small. We establish a non-asymptotic bound on the $\ell_{2}$-estimation error of the estimator. This bound explains situations under which the group Lasso estimator is potentially superior/inferior to the $\ell_{1}$-penalized quantile regression estimator in terms of the estimation error. We also propose a data-dependent choice of the tuning parameter to make the method more practical, by extending the original proposal of Belloni and Chernozhukov (2011) for the $\ell_{1}$-penalized quantile regression estimator. As an application, we analyze high dimensional additive quantile regression models. We show that under a set of suitable regularity conditions, the group Lasso estimator can attain the convergence rate arbitrarily close to the oracle rate. Finally, we conduct simulations experiments to examine our theoretical results.",2011,arXiv: Methodology
Ethnobotanical survey of medicinal plants used to treat gastrointestinal parasites in human and livestock in four geographic areas of Burkina Faso (West Africa),"In four (4) areas (Bobo-Dioulasso, Boni, Fada-Nâ€™Gou rma and Pobe-Mengao) belonging to three (3) regions of Burkina Faso, a survey of medicinal plants used by traditional healers for treatment of gastrointestin al parasites in both human and animals has been carried out from 20 05 to 2006. Interview approach was used to document indigenous knowledge and uses of plant species as r emedies. A total of 58 traditional healers constitu ted of 79.3% by men and 20.7% by womenwere interviewed for their knowledge on the use of plants for the treatment o f gastrointestinal (GI) parasites. 12, 16, 18 and 12 respondents were met respectively at Bobo-Dioulasso , Boni, FadaNâ€™Gourma and Pobe-Mengao. Twenty five (25) plan ts used in both humans and animals have been report ed. 36 % of these plants are commonly used in all the 4 study sites for the treatment of gastrointestinal parasites.

Model Selection and Estimation in Regression with Grouped Variables 4 Ming Yuan and,"We consider the problem of selecting grouped variables (factors) for accurate prediction in regression. Such a problem arises naturally in many practical situations with the multi-factor ANOVA problem as the most important and well known example. Instead of selecting factors by stepwise backward elimination, we focus on estimation accuracy and consider extensions of the LASSO, the LARS, and the nonnegative garrote for factor selection. The LASSO, the LARS, and the nonnegative garrote are recently proposed regression methods that can be used to select individual variables. We study and propose efficient algorithms for the extensions of these methods for factor selection, and show that these extensions give superior performance to the traditional stepwise backward elimination method in factor selection problems. We study the similarities and the differences among these methods. Simulations and real examples are used to illustrate the methods.",2004,
Biological Transmission of Bacteria Inhibit By Hemolymph Lectins of American Cockroach,"Background: Although cockroaches are mechanical vector of many pathogens, still biological transmission of pathogens via these insects is controversial. More covenant immune defense in the hemolymph of cockroaches may take this advantage to block any adaptation of pathogens regarding to biological transmission. Lectin molecules in hemolymph of insects play as mediators of nonself recognition, in the innate immune response. Methods: Initially, lectin-carbohydrate interactions in hemolymph of American cockroach, Periplaneta, americana, have been investigated and then as a model, non pathogenic soil bacterium, Streptomyces griseus was used to specify the cockroach hemolymph reaction. Results: The results showed that the hemolymph lectin activities were inhibited with GlcNAc, galactose, mannose, arabinose, and fucose but not with fructose, lactose and glucose. Also, S. griseus cells were agglutinated with the cockroach hemolymph while in the presence of fructose, mannose and galactose, the agglutinin activities were inhibited. Introducing the soil bacterium, S. griseus, into the hemolymph increased both the lectin activities as well as the number of hemocytes from an average 101 to 2688 cells per milliliter hemolymph 6 days after injection. At the same time, the number of prohemocytes in the hemolymph declined while the granular cell numbers rapidly increased. Conclusion: Generally injecting S. griseus into the cockroach body resulted in a positive correlation between an increase in hemolymph titers and enhancement of hemocyte numbers. The results tentatively support the idea that soluble and/or cellassociated lectins may be involved in immuno-recognition in insects and block biological transmission of pathogens.",2008,Iranian Journal of Public Health
Complicanze della chirurgia gastrica e bariatrica,"La chirurgia gastrica classica (antrectomia, gastrectomia totale, gastrectomia polare superiore) non viene quasi piu praticata tranne che in caso di cancro dello stomaco, ma la chirurgia bariatrica si sviluppa rapidamente per il trattamento dellâ€™obesita morbosa resistente al trattamento medico; i principali interventi sono Â«restrittiviÂ» (anello gastrico, gastrectomia longitudinale) e Â«malassorbitiviÂ» (principalmente bypass gastrointestinale) e sono realizzati in laparoscopia. La mortalita operatoria e, oggi, molto debole, ma non nulla. Sono possibili delle complicanze immediate (le fistole anastomotiche e gli accidenti tromboembolici sono le piu gravi). Delle complicanze secondarie o ritardate multiple spiegano la necessita di una sorveglianza a vita. Dopo il posizionamento di un anello, la disfagia per restrizione eccessiva, la pseudoacalasia, lo scivolamento dellâ€™anello (vomito) e la migrazione transgastrica sono le piu gravi; il reflusso gastroesofageo e frequente dopo lâ€™anello o la gastrectomia longitudinale; lâ€™endoscopia e la radiografia baritata eso-gastro-duodenale sono le principali esplorazioni necessarie. Le ulcere sono principalmente anastomotiche (e necessaria lâ€™endoscopia preoperatoria con ricerca ed eradicazione di Helicobacter pylori) e sono favorite dallâ€™assunzione di antinfiammatori non steroidei. La perdita di peso favorisce la litiasi biliare che deve essere prevenuta (acido ursodesossicolico). La dumping syndrome e le ipoglicemie reattive (dopo unâ€™anastomosi gastrodigiunale) richiedono in primo luogo delle misure dietetiche. La diarrea e frequente: puo essere motoria (sensibile alla loperamide), osmotica (lattosio, edulcoranti) e malassorbitiva (importanza del cortocircuito intestinale e pullulazione microbica endoluminale nellâ€™ansa cieca). Le epatopatie steatosiche regrediscono, di solito, dopo la chirurgia bariatrica, ma possono anche, raramente, aggravarsi dopo lâ€™intervento (dimagrimento troppo rapido? Pullulazione microbica intestinale?). Unâ€™iperossaluria puo complicarsi con una litiasi aftosa e con unâ€™insufficienza renale. Numerose carenze (ferro, vitamina B12, folati, calcio, vitamine D, E, K, A, acidi grassi essenziali e vitamina B1) devono essere diagnosticate e prevenute. Una stasi gastrica con un eventuale fitobezoar e possibile dopo vagotomia o antrectomia; il moncone gastrico dopo una gastrectomia parziale deve essere controllato (endoscopia e biopsie) dopo 10-15Â anni, per evidenziare la comparsa di displasia e di cancro.",2013,EMC - AKOS - Trattato di Medicina
In-Group Favoritism Caused by Pokemon Go and the Use of Machine Learning for Principled Investigation of Potential Moderators,"A large body of laboratory-based research suggests that arbitrary group assignments (ie. ""minimal groups"") can lead to in-group bias. We use the release of a popular augmented reality game Pokemon Go to study this phenomenon in a hybrid lab-field experiment. We analyze the behavior of 940 Pokemon Go players randomly matched to other Pokemon Go players to participate in Prisoner's Dilemma games. We find that participants are much more cooperative when their partners is from the same Pokemon Go team, demonstrating an ecologically valid occurrence of the minimal group paradigm. We also use transformed outcome lasso regressions to look for heterogeneity in treatment effects. Machine learning, rather than manual data mining, minimizes overfitting and reduces susceptibility to multiple comparison issues and researcher degrees of freedom. We find one important moderator of the effect: the salience of Pokemon Go. As it's popularity wanes, so does the size of the group bias in our experiments. Thus our full set of results show that real-world minimal group bias is quick to arise but also potentially fragile.",2017,Social Science Research Network
Sparse Bayesian linear regression using generalized normal priors,"A sparse Bayesian linear regression model is proposed that generalizes the Bayesian Lasso to a class of Bayesian models with scale mixtures of normal distributions as priors for the regression coefficients. We assume a hierarchical Bayesian model with a binary indicator for whether a predictor variable is included in the model, a generalized normal prior distribution for the coefficients of the included variables, and a Student-t error model for robustness to heavy tailed noise. Our model out-performs other popular sparse regression estimators on synthetic and real data.",2017,IJWMIP
Simple Granger Causality Tests for Mixed Frequency Data,"This paper presents simple Granger causality tests applicable to any mixed frequency sampling data setting, which feature remarkable power properties even with a relatively small sample size. Our tests are based on a seemingly overlooked, but simple, dimension reduction technique for regression models. If the number of parameters of interest is large then in small or even large samples any of the trilogy test statistics may not be well approximated by their asymptotic distribution. A bootstrap method can be employed to improve empirical test size, but this generally results in a loss of power. A shrinkage estimator can be employed, including Lasso, Adaptive Lasso, or Ridge Regression, but these are valid only under a sparsity assumption which does not apply to Granger causality tests. The procedure, which is of general interest when testing potentially large sets of parameter restrictions, involves multiple parsimonious regression models where each model regresses a low frequency variable onto only one individual lag or lead of a high frequency series, where that lag or lead slope parameter is necessarily zero under the null hypothesis of non-causality. Our test is then based on a max test statistic that selects the largest squared estimator among all parsimonious regression models. Parsimony ensures sharper estimates and therefore improved power in small samples. We show via Monte Carlo simulations that the max test is particularly powerful for causality with a large time lag.",2017,
RÃ©adaptation aprÃ¨s chirurgie palliative de la coxarthrose,"RÃ©sumÃ©AprÃ¨s chirurgie palliative de la coxarthrose, l'Ã©quilibre fonctionnel du patient est rompu sur le plan moteur, mais aussi sur le plan psychologique.

Reconstruction left atrium and isolation pulmonary veins of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation using single contact force catheter with zero x-ray exposure,"Background: Conventional ablation of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) is associated with radiation risks for patients and laboratory staff. Three-dimensional (3D) mapping system capable of showing contact force (CF) and direction of catheter tip may compensate for nonfluoroscopic safety issues. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of zero x-ray exposure during reconstruction left atrium (LA) and ablation. Methods: Single, CF catheter, and 3D mapping system were used to reconstruct LA and isolate pulmonary veins (PV) in all patients. The patients were randomly divided into 2 groups after LA angiography. In group 1, reconstruction LA and isolation PV was performed with the help of 3D system (without x-ray), whereas in group 2, x-ray and 3D system were utilized to reconstruct LA and ablate PV antrum. After ablation, Lasso catheter was used to confirm the PV isolation. All patients were followed up to 12 months. Results: A total of 342 PAF patients were continuously enrolled. The basic clinical characteristics between the 2 groups had no significant difference. Parameters related to the procedure, average procedure time, ablation procedure time, average contact force (CF) applied, the percentage of time within CF settings, and average power applied during radiofrequency application showed no significant difference between the 2 groups. In group 1, the average fluoroscopy time before LA reconstruction was similar to that in group 2 (2.8â€ŠÂ±â€Š0.4 vs. 2.4â€ŠÂ±â€Š0.6 minutes, Pâ€Š=â€Š.75). The average fluoroscopy time during ablation was significantly lower than that in group 2 (0 vs. 7.6â€ŠÂ±â€Š1.3 minutes, Pâ€Š<â€Š.001). The total x-ray exposure dose of the procedure in group 1 was significantly lower than that in group 2 (19.6â€ŠÂ±â€Š9.4 vs. 128.7â€ŠÂ±â€Š62.5 mGy, respectively, Pâ€Š<â€Š.001). Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that there were no statistical differences in the probability of freedom from atrial arrhythmia (AF/AFL/AT) recurrence at 12 months between group 1 and group 2 (Pâ€Š=â€Š.152). The success rate after a single ablation procedure and without drugs (Class I/III AAD) at 12 months was not significantly different between the 2 groups (67.6%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 62%â€“79.5% in group 1 and 68.9%, 95% CI: 63%â€“80.7% in group 2, Pâ€Š=â€Š.207). Procedural-related adverse events showed no significant different incidence between group 1 and group 2. A multivariate logistic regression analysis of risk factors was performed to evaluate the effectiveness outcome, which demonstrated that the percentage of CF (within the investigator-selected work ranges) during therapy was significantly associated with positive outcomes (odds ratio: 3.68; 95% CI: 1.65â€“10.6, Pâ€Š=â€Š.008), whereas the LA dimension was negatively associated with effectiveness outcomes (odds ratio: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.52â€“0.84, Pâ€Š=â€Š.016). Conclusions: Reconstruction LA and isolation PV ablation using single CF-assisted catheter without x-ray exposure was both safe and effective. CF was positively associated with effective outcomes and LA dimensions negatively with effective ones.",2017,Medicine
Principle and Applications of KKMâ€”maps,"Knaster, Kuratowski, and Mazurk\(\ddot i\)ewicz proved a very important result (KKM theorem) in 1929, presently it is known as the KKM-map principle. This result is equivalent to the well known topological fixed point theorem due to Brouwer. The KKM theorem gave a simplified proof of Brouwerâ€™s theorem. Ky Fan [89] extended the KKM theorem to topological vector spaces and gave several interesting applications in the fixed point theory, minimax theory, and game theory. There have appeared several extensions, unifications, and equivalent formulations of Ky Fanâ€™s theorem. Because of its widespread applications and importance, it is now known as the KKMmap theory. A very interesting paper due to Granas [101] is worth reading on this topic as it includes a lot of applications. Recently, it has been shown that the KKM theory, the fixed point theory, the variational inequality and the geometric form of KKM-map principle all are equivalent (Results in this direction due to Gwinner [104]; Tarafdar [293]; Mehta and Tarafdar [187]; Lassonde [163]; Park [212], [214]; Tan [285], [286]; Tan and Yuan [288]; and Yuan [309] are of interest).",1997,

"Palynostratigraphy of the Berriasian to Cenomanian Sequence at Deep Sea Drilling Project Site 535, Leg 77, Southeastern Gulf of Mexico","One hundred twenty-seven samples from DSDP Cores 535-18 to 535-79 have been analyzed palynologically and dated using dinoflagellate cysts. The taxa recorded indicate the presence of sediments of late Berriasian/late Valanginian (Sections 535-79-1 to 535-55-6) and Hauterivian (Sections 535-55-4 to 535-47-1) age. These sediments are unconformably overlain by Aptian deposits (Sections 535-46-2 to 535-43-3). Sections 535-43-2 to 535-18-1 yielded palynofloras of Aptian to Albian age. Ammonite evidence (Young, this volume), however, suggests reworking of these assemblages into Cenomanian deposits. INTRODUCTION Leg 77 of the Glomar Challenger was located in the western straits of Florida, southeastern Gulf of Mexico. The drilling conducted during the Leg is part of an overall program to study the evolution of the western North Atlantic passive margin, and to investigate the Mesozoic and Cenozoic history of the area. PALYNOLOGIC RESULTS General Discussion The Cretaceous sequence (Berriasian-Cenomanian) at Site 535 yields rich palynofloras, containing varying proportions of dinoflagellate cysts, acritarchs, chlorophycean algae and miospores. These palynomorphs occur in association with relatively large numbers of microforaminiferal test-linings and tintinnid loricas. Marine microplankton dominate throughout the sequence, with terrestrially derived miospores making only minor contributions to the assemblages. Miospore assemblages are relatively homogeneous in composition and display low taxonomic diversity. Pollen of gymnosperm origin predominate, in particular longranging species of Callialasporites, Classopollis and bisaccates. Within the late Berriasian-Aptian interval Classopollis is the most numerous miospore, reticulate angiosperm pollen first appearing in the Cenomanian. Foraminiferal test-linings are encountered in very high numbers throughout the Cretaceous at Site 535, being especially prominant in the late Berriasian-early Valanginian and Aptian-Cenomanian intervals. Throughout the late Berriasian-Hauterivian, tintinnid loricas are consistently observed. They occasionally occur in large numbers, especially within the late Berriasian-early Valanginian. 1 Buffler, R. X, Schlager, W., et al., Init. Repts. DSDP, 77: Washington (U.S. Govt. Printing Office). 2 Present address: Gearhart Geoconsultants Limited, Dyce, Aberdeen, Scotland. Preservation of individual palynomorphs is generally good, and amorphous organic matter is the dominant kerogen throughout. Terrestrially derived kerogen components (structured vitrinite and inertinite, plant cuticles, and miospores) are present in only minor quantities. Stratigraphy Emphasis during the course of this study has been on palynomorphs of marine origin, especially dinoflagellate cysts. Dating is by comparison with known stratigraphic ranges established in accurately dated European onshore sections and local ranges established at previous DSDP sites in the North Atlantic. This information is to be found in the following publications which deal with various aspects of the onshore European and offshore Atlantic Lower Cretaceous: Davey [1978 (Aptian), 1979b (Portlandian-Barremian), 1979a (Aptian-Albian)]; Davey and Verdier [1971, 1973, 1974 (Aptian-Albian)]; Duxbury [1977 (Berriasian-Barremian)]; Fisher and Riley [1980 (Kimmeridgian-Valanginian)]; Habib [1972 (Oxfordian-Cenomanian), 1978 (Berriasian-Albian)]; Verdier [1975 (Barremian-Albian)]; Williams and Bujak [1979 (Berriasian-Hauterivian)]; and unpublished research by the authors on both onshore and offshore European Lower Cretaceous. The stratigraphic distribution and relative abundance of the marine palynomorphs recovered during this investigation are shown on Figs. 1-4. In addition, the stratigraphic ranges of 49 ""key taxa,"" which have been chosen for their chronostratigraphic potential, are shown on Fig. 5.

Similarity regularized sparse group lasso for cup to disc ratio computation.,"Automatic cup to disc ratio (CDR) computation from color fundus images has shown to be promising for glaucoma detection. Over the past decade, many algorithms have been proposed. In this paper, we first review the recent work in the area and then present a novel similarity-regularized sparse group lasso method for automated CDR estimation. The proposed method reconstructs the testing disc image based on a set of reference disc images by integrating the similarity between testing and the reference disc images with the sparse group lasso constraints. The reconstruction coefficients are then used to estimate the CDR of the testing image. The proposed method has been validated using 650 images with manually annotated CDRs. Experimental results show an average CDR error of 0.0616 and a correlation coefficient of 0.7, outperforming other methods. The areas under curve in the diagnostic test reach 0.843 and 0.837 when manual and automatically segmented discs are used respectively, better than other methods as well.",2017,Biomedical optics express
"Pattern Alternating Maximization Algorithm for Missing Data in Large P, Small N Problems","We propose a new and computationally efficient algorithm for maximizing the observed log-likelihood for a multivariate normal data matrix with missing values. We show that our procedure based on iteratively regressing the missing on the observed variables, generalizes the standard EM algorithm by alternating between different complete data spaces and performing the E-Step incrementally. In this non-standard setup we prove numerical convergence to a stationary point of the observed log-likelihood. 
For high-dimensional data, where the number of variables may greatly exceed sample size, we add a Lasso penalty in the regression part of our algorithm and perform coordinate descent approximations. This leads to a computationally very attractive technique with sparse regression coefficients for missing data imputation. Simulations and results on four microarray datasets show that the new method often outperforms other imputation techniques as k-nearest neighbors imputation, nuclear norm minimization or a penalized likelihood approach with an l1-penalty on the inverse covariance matrix.",2010,arXiv: Methodology
Quantile regression and variable selection for single-index varying-coefficient models,"ABSTRACT In this article, a new efficient iteration procedure based on quantile regression is developed for single-index varying-coefficient models. The proposed estimation scheme is an extension of the full iteration procedure proposed by Carroll et al., which is different with the method adopted by Wu et al. for single-index models that a double-weighted summation is used therein. This distinguish not only be the reason that undersmoothing should be a necessary condition in our proposed procedure, but also may reduce the computational burden especially for large-sample size. The resulting estimators are shown to be robust with regardless of outliers as well as varying errors. Moreover, to achieve sparsity when there exist irrelevant variables in the index parameters, a variable selection procedure combined with adaptive LASSO penalty is developed to simultaneously select and estimate significant parameters. Theoretical properties of the obtained estimators are established under some regular conditions, and some simulation studies with various distributed errors are conducted to assess the finite sample performance of our proposed method.",2017,Communications in Statistics - Simulation and Computation
Development and validation of CT imagingâ€“based preoperative nomogram in the prediction of unfavorable high-grade small renal masses,"Purpose
In recent years, there has been an increase in the incidence of small renal masses (SRMs) and nephrectomy was the standard management of this disease in the past. Currently, the use of active surveillance has been recommended as an alternative option in the case of some patients with SRMs due to its heterogenicity. However, limited studies focused on the regarding risk stratification. Therefore, in the current study, we developed a nomogram for the purpose of predicting the presence of high-grade SRMs on the basis of the patient information provided (clinical information, hematological indicators, and CT imaging data).


Patients and methods
A total of 329 patients (consisting of development and validation cohort) who had undergone nephrectomy for SRMs between January 2013 and May 2016 retrospectively were recruited for the present study. All preoperative information, including clinical predictors, hematological indicators, and CT predictors, were obtained. Lasso regression model was used for data dimension reduction and feature selection. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was applied for the establishment of the predicting model. The performance of the nomogram was assessed with respect to its calibration and discrimination properties and externally validated.


Results
The predictors used in the assessment of the nomogram included tumor size, CT tumor contour, CT necrosis, CT tumor exophytic properties, and CT collecting system oppression. Based on these parameters, the nomogram was evaluated to have an effective discrimination and calibration ability, and the C-index was found to be 0.883 after internal validation and 0.887 following external validation.


Conclusion
Based on the aforementioned findings, it can be concluded that CT imaging-based preoperative nomogram is an effective predictor of SRMs and hence can be used in the preoperative evaluation of SRMs, due to its calibration and discrimination abilities.",2019,Cancer Management and Research

Phylogenetic Affinities of Pygmy Sunfishes (Elassoma) Inferred from Mitochondrial DNA Sequences,"Pygmy sunfishes (genus Elassoma) comprise six nominal species: three are common and three are comparatively rare. Relationships of pygmy sunfishes to one another are not well known, in part because relationships of pygmy sunfishes to other teleosts are controversial. We examined relationships of Elassoma to several putative sister groups suggested by previous comparative studies. Phylogenetic analysis of the mitochondrially encoded 12S rDNA (287 bp) and 16S rDNA (412 bp) genes did not unambiguously resolve relationships of Elassoma but did indicate alternative hypotheses that were consistent with molecular data. These include a sistergroup relationship between Elassoma and Centrarchidae plus Moronidae. Alternatively, rDNA sequences are not consistent with hypothesized sister-group relationships between Elassoma and Atherinomorphs or Elassoma plus Cichlidae.",1999,Copeia

Are higher-order factors useful in pricing the cross-section of hedge fund returns?,"This paper investigates hedge fundsâ€™ exposures to various risk factors across different investment strategies through models with both linear and second-order factors. We extend the analysis from an augmented linear model based on Fama & French (1993) and Fung & Hsieh (2001) to second-order models that include all quadratic and interaction terms by adopting a novel multistep strategy that combines the variable selection capabilities of the LASSO regression with the Fama & MacBeth (1973) two-step method. We find that, for some strategies, several quadratic and interaction terms are statistically significant. Nonetheless, there is no evidence that the second-order models have more overall explanatory or predictive power than the linear model. Moreover, while both linear and second-order models perform well for directional funds (like emerging markets, event driven and managed futures), missing factors may still remain for semi-directional funds, such as fund of funds, long/short equity hedge and multi-strategy.",2019,
Learning with structures,"In this dissertation we discuss learning with structures, which appears frequently in both machine learning theories and applications. First we review existing structure learning algorithms, then we study several specifically interesting problems. The first problem we study is the structure learning of dynamic systems. We investigate using dynamic Bayesian networks to reconstruct functional cortical networks from the spike trains of neurons. Next we study structure learning from matrix factorization, which has been a popular research area in recent years. We propose an efficient non-negative matrix factorization algorithm which derives not only the membership assignments to the clusters but also the interaction strengths among the clusters. Following that we study the hierarchical and grouped structure in regularization. We propose a novel regularizer called group lasso which introduces competitions among variables in groups, and thus results in sparse solutions. Finally we study the sparse structure in a novel problem of online feature selection, and propose an online learning algorithm that only needs to sense a small number of attributes before the reliable decision can be made.",2011,

During the treatment period ; 30 patients received over 3 months 6 capsules of EPL daily, whereas the other 30 patients were administered a placebo. The observation period lasted 6 months. All patients finished the study in accordance with the trial protocol. During the 4-week thalassotherapy, the additional therapy with the investigational preparation allowed us to achieve significantly better healing of the skin efflorescences than with placebo. During the 2-month maintenance treatment with EPL the occurrence of recidivation was significantly delayed. After the end of the 6-month observation period the psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) was reduced by 73.9% in the group receiving EPL, while in the placebo group the reduction of PASI was 38.3%. Tolerance was good in all cases. The difference between the treatment groups with respect to the general assessment of the therapeutic success was significant in favour of the investigational preparation.",1996,Zeitschrift fuÌˆr Hautkrankheiten

Prognostic Value of a BCSC-associated MicroRNA Signature in Hormone Receptor-Positive HER2-Negative Breast Cancer,"PURPOSE
Breast cancer patients with high proportion of cancer stem cells (BCSCs) have unfavorable clinical outcomes. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate key features of BCSCs. We hypothesized that a biology-driven model based on BCSC-associated miRNAs could predict prognosis for the most common subtype, hormone receptor (HR)-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer patients.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
After screening candidate miRNAs based on literature review and a pilot study, we built a miRNA-based classifier using LASSO Cox regression method in the training group (n=202) and validated its prognostic accuracy in an internal (n=101) and two external validation groups (n=308).


RESULTS
In this multicenter study, a 10-miRNA classifier incorporating miR-21, miR-30c, miR-181a, miR-181c, miR-125b, miR-7, miR-200a, miR-135b, miR-22 and miR-200c was developed to predict distant relapse free survival (DRFS). With this classifier, HR+HER2- patients were scored and classified into high-risk and low-risk disease recurrence, which was significantly associated with 5-year DRFS of the patients. Moreover, this classifier outperformed traditional clinicopathological risk factors, IHC4 scoring and 21-gene Recurrence Score (RS). The patients with high-risk recurrence determined by this classifier benefit more from chemotherapy.


CONCLUSIONS
Our 10-miRNA-based classifier provides a reliable prognostic model for disease recurrence in HR+HER2- breast cancer patients. This model may facilitate personalized therapy-decision making for HR+HER2- individuals.",2016,EBioMedicine
Magnetic resonance imaging based radiomics signature for the preoperative discrimination of stage I-II and III-IV head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.,"PURPOSE
This study aimed to investigate the predictive ability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based radiomics signature for the preoperative staging in HNSCC.


METHODS
This study involved127 consecutive patients (training cohort: nâ€¯=â€¯85; testing cohort, nâ€¯=â€¯42) with stage I-IV HNSCC. A total of 970 radiomics features were extracted from T2-weighted (T2W) (nâ€¯=â€¯485) and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (ceT1W) (nâ€¯=â€¯485) MRI for each case. Radiomics signatures were constructed with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression. Associations between radiomics signatures and HNSCC staging were explored. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and classification performance of radiomics signatures were determined and compared with those of the visual assessment.


RESULTS
Ten features from T2W images, six from ceT1W images, and six from combined T2W and ceT1W images were selected by LASSO logistic regression. The three radiomics signatures of stage III-IV HNSCC were significantly higher than that for stage I-II in both cohorts (all Pâ€¯<â€¯0.05). The radiomics signatures from ceT1W and combined images performed well in the discrimination of stage I-II and III-IV HNSCC, with AUCs of 0.828 and 0.850 in the training cohort, and AUCs of 0.853 and 0.849 in the testing cohort. Based on the cut-off value of the training cohort, the radiomics signature from combined images achieved best classification performance in both cohorts, with accuracies of 0.788 and 0.857, sensitivities of 0.836 and 0.885, and specificities of 0.700 and 0.813. Significant differences in accuracy and sensitivity were found between the radiomics signature from combined images and the visual assessment of the radiologists in the training cohort.


CONCLUSION
Radiomics signature based on MRI could discriminate stage I-II from stage III-IV HNSCC, which may serve as a complementary tool for preoperative staging.",2018,European journal of radiology
Doubly Penalized LASSO for Reconstruction of Biological Networks,"Reconstruction of biological and biochemical networks is a crucial step in extracting information from a large volume of biological data. There are several methods developed recently to reconstruct biological networks using dynamic data, each with specific benefits and some drawbacks. Here, we have developed a new method called Doubly Penalized Linear Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (DPLASSO) for reconstruction of dynamic biological networks. In this approach, we have integrated two distinct methods viz., statistical significance testing of model coefficients and penalized/constrained optimization. Principal component analysis with statistical significance testing acts as a supervisory-level filter to extract the most informative components of the network from a dataset (Layer 1). In the lower level (Layer 2), LASSO with extra weights on the smaller parameters obtained in the first layer is employed to retain the main predictors and to set the small coefficients to zero. Two case studies are used to compare the relative performance of DPLASSO and LASSO in terms of several metrics, such as sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and fractional-error in the estimates of the coefficients. In the first case study, with a synthetic data set, our simulation results show substantial improvements over LASSO for the reconstruction of the network in terms of accuracy and specificity. The second case study relies on experimental datasets for cell division cycle of fission yeast. This case study illustrates that DPLASSO performs better than LASSO in terms of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy in reconstructing networks.",2012,"2012 IEEE Second International Conference on Healthcare Informatics, Imaging and Systems Biology"
Prediction Divergence Criterion for Model Selection in the Logistic Regression,"In this Master Thesis, we have analytically derived and numerically implemented three estimators of the Prediction Divergence Criterion (Avella-Medina et al., working paper) for Model Selection within the logistic regression framework. After the validation of these estimators by means of simulations, we have performed Model Selection both when the order of the variables was known in advance and when the order was correct but decided by an already existing algorithm, namely the binary lasso (Friedman et al., 2010). Finally we have produced evidences of the good performance of two of these estimators, one derived from the L2 norm error measure and the other from the binomial deviance, respectively in highly and moderately correlated settings. They have been proven better, to the extension of the simulation study, than the defaults methods, based on 10-fold Cross Validation, currently available in the glmnet(Friedman et al., 2017) R package.",2018,
09-1 Effects of balneological factors and treatments on aging,"Increasing ratio of elderly population calls not only attention to the common health problems related to ageing and but the necessity to fight against these problems more effectively and protect the health and wellbeing of elderly population and keep them healthy as long as possible. Balneological treatments have been being used widely in many countries for treating certain pathologies mostly the rheumatic diseases for centuries. Recently, beyond the therapeutic effects of diverse balneotherapeutic factors and interventions, their possible preventive effects are being more intensively considered by the investigators. With the expectation that they might play a preventative role on human health in general, beneficial effects of balneotherapy, mud therapy, thalassotherapy and hydrotherapy are being increasingly investigated and documented. Even though the studies reporting these beneficial effects are not directly related to the biological and physiological processes which are predominant in the elderly population, some results reported in the publications might be considered as anti-aging effects. With this perspective a review of existing literature obtained after a comprehensive database search relieved that balneology interventions seem to attenuate a remarkable range of aging processes and phenotypes in apparently with their proven effects on attenuation of inflammatory and oxidative processes. The evidence on the positive effects of investigated balneological and climatological factors and interventions on the conserved aging phenotypes indicates that balneology and spa tradition could be a tool for healthy and graceful ageing.",2014,

Pelagic distribution and numbers of the Antarctic petrel Thalassoica antarctica in the Weddell Sea during spring,"Estimates of the population size of the Antarctic petrelThalassoica antarctica are hampered by its breeding locations in remote nunatak areas of the Antarctic continent. Studies at sea can provide additional information on numbers. Seabird censuses during spring 1992 showed few Antarctic petrels in the western part of the Weddell Sea, but high numbers east of the South Sandwich Islands. The vast majority of the birds occurred in a band of 300 km north to 150 km south of the outer ice edge. Numbers at sea fluctuated in agreement with synchronized colony attendance patterns in the pre-breeding phase and peaked shortly before egglaying when colonies are completely deserted. In this period, densities of Antarctic petrels in the marginal ice zone suggest that at least 2.7Â±0.5 million individuals occur in the Weddell Sea. It is likely that similar numbers occur immediately east of the study area. The distribution of the petrels matches the location, but not the size, of known breeding colonies in Dronning Maud Land and Coats Land, which suggests that important colonies in this area remain to be discovered. The observations imply that Antarctic petrels in the Weddell Sea commute over ice a surprisingly large distance of at least 2,000 km for a single pre-breeding visit to the colonies.",1996,Polar Biology

Oversampled Adaptive Sensing,"We develop a Bayesian framework for sensing which adapts the sensing time and/or basis functions to the instantaneous sensing quality measured in terms of the expected posterior mean-squared error. For sparse Gaussian sources a significant reduction in average sensing time and/or mean-squared error is achieved in comparison to non-adaptive sensing. For compression ratio 3, a sparse 10% Gaussian source and equal average sensing times, the proposed method gains about 2 dB over the performance bound of optimum compressive sensing, about 3 dB over non-adaptive 3-fold oversampled orthogonal sensing and about 6 to 7 dB to LASSO-based recovery schemes while enjoying polynomial time complexity. We utilize that in the presence of Gaussian noise the mean-squared error conditioned on the current observation is proportional to the derivative of the conditional mean estimate with respect to this observation.",2018,2018 Information Theory and Applications Workshop (ITA)
"Food of Cobia , Rachycentron canadum , from the Northcentral Gulf of Mexico","The stomach contents of 403 cobia, Rachycentron canadwn, caught in the northcentral Gulf of Mexico recreational fishery from April through October of 1987-1990 were examined. Cobia ranged from 373-1,530 mm in fork length. Of the 403 stomachs, 287 (71.2%) contained at least one identifiable prey taxon. Crustaceans, consisting primarily of portunid crabs, were the predominant food. Crustaceans occurred in 79.1% of the stomachs and comprised 77.6% of the total number of identifiable prey. The second most important prey categoy was fish which was dominated by hardhead catfish, Arius felis, and eels. Fish occurred in 58.5% of the stomachs but only accounted for 20.3% of the total number of prey. The importance of fish as prey increased withincreasing size(length)ofcobia, with thelargest sizeclassofcobia(1,150-1,530mmFL)showingthehighest percent frequency occurrence of fish prey (84.4%). There were no significant differences between the diets of male and female cobia. Species composition of the diet indicated that cobia examined in this study were generalist carnivores in their feeding habits and fed primarily on benthic/epibenthic crustaceans and fishes. However, the Occurrence of pelagic prey provided evidence of diversity in the foraging behavior of cobia.

Zur Methodik der Bestimmung der Antibiotikumempfindlichkeit von Chlamydien in vitro,"Summary 
 
Methods of Investigation of Antibiotic Resistance of Chlamydiae in Vitro 
 
 
 
In this paper first the various methods for testing antibiotic resistance of chlamydiae (estimation of minimum inhibitory concentration = MIC, minimum bactericidal concentration = MBC; â€œwashed and reincubatedâ€ method) are discussed. The MIC of the antibiotic doxycyline was determined for 12 strains of Chlamydia psittaci in cell cultures and the influence of a number of factors on the test results investigated. 
 
 
 
McCoy and BGM cells were equally suited for determination of the MIC. Various amounts of protein in the medium and addition of cycloheximide did not influence the test results. For the 12 Chlamydia psittaci strains the average MIC value was 0.03Î¼g/ml. Prolongation of incubation of the test-tubes (90 instead of 40 hours) altered results only insignificantly. The optimal time for the addition of the antibiotic to the infected cells was within the first two hours after infection. 
 
 
 
For determination of the MBC, repeated washing of the infected and treated cell cultures was paramount. Cell-associated doxycycline needed up to 48 hours to be washed out of the cells. A MBC could not be determined for the doxycycline preparation investigated (VibravenosÂ®, Pfitzer), since 20 Î¼g/ml were not sufficient for the elimination of the agent from the cells, and higher amounts proved to be cytotoxic. 
 
 
 
The MBC as determined by a number of authors is questioned, because detection of mature infectious chlamydiae (elementary bodies) may not be substantiated after disintegration of the cells, due to the developmental cycle of chlamydiae. 
 
 
 
Zusammenfassung 
 
In der vorliegenden Arbeit werden zunachst die verschiedenen Methoden zur Bestimmung der Antibiotikumempfindlichkeit von Chlamydien â€” minimale Hemmkonzentration (MHK), minimale bakterizide Konzentration (MBK) und die â€œwashed and reincubatedâ€ (W & R)-Methode â€” besprochen. 
 
 
 
Da die von verschiedenen Autoren verwendeten Untersuchungsmethoden variieren, wurden eigene Untersuchungen zur Bestimmung der MHK und MBK des Antibiotikums Doxycyclin (VibravenosÂ®, Fa. Pfizer) durchgefuhrt und dabei der Einflus verschiedener Faktoren auf das Versuchsergebnis ermittelt. 
 
 
 
McCoy- und BGM-Zellen sind gleichermasen fur den MHK-Test geeignet. Der Eiweisgehalt des Mediums sowie der Zusatz von Actidion hatte keinerlei Einflus auf die MHK. Die MHK fur Doxycyclin betrug fur 12 untersuchte Chl. psittaci-Stamme im Mittel 0,03Î¼g/ml. Eine Verlangerung der Versuchszeit beeinfluste die MHK nur unwesentlich, z.T. erhdhten sich die Werte um 0,01 Î¼g/ml. Als optimaler Zeitpunkt fur die Zugabe des Doxycyclins zur infizierten Zellkultur wurden die ersten 2 Stunden p. i. ermittelt. 
 
 
 
Zur Bestimmung der MBK erwies sich ein mehrmaliges Waschen der infizierten und antibiotisch behandelten Zellkultur als zwingend erforderlich, da zellassoziiertes Doxycyclin eine gewisse Zeit benotigt, um aus den Zellen herausgewaschen zu werden. Erst die in Anschlus daran vorgenommene Reinkubation und Passagierung fuhrt zu gesicherten Aussagen bezuglich der Bakterizidie von Antibiotika gegen Chl. psittaci. Im vorliegenden Fall konnte fur das verwendete Doxycyclinpraparat â€œVibravenosÂ®â€ die MBK nicht bestimmt werden, da Mengen von 20 Î¼g/ml fur eine Eliminierung des Erregers nicht ausreichten und hohere Konzentrationen zytotoxische Effekte hervorriefen. 
 
 
 
Die minimale bakterizide Konzentration, wie sie von vielen Autoren bestimmt wird, wird in Frage gestellt, da den eigenen Untersuchungen zufolge und auch aufgrund von Literaturangaben hier der Nachweis von reifen, infektiosen Chlamydien (Elementarkorperchen) nach Aufschlus der antibiotikumbehandelten infizierten Wirtszellen unzureichend ist.",1986,Journal of Veterinary Medicine Series B-infectious Diseases and Veterinary Public Health
Predictive Analytics in Long Term Care,"This chapter introduces machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques for analyzing long term care risks. The focus is on incidence rates, but the methods can be extended to termination and lapse rates. Four algorithms are described: generalized linear model, Lasso, neural networks and extreme gradient boosting. We provide practical advice how to clean and prepare data, train and validate models and show how to test and compare the accuracy of the different algorithms. The chapter provides the tools for developing LTC risk rates from either industry data or an insurerâ€™s proprietary database.",2019,
Predictive model algorithms identifying early and advanced stage ER+/HER2âˆ’ breast cancer in claims data,"PURPOSE
Claims databases offer large populations for research, but lack clinical details. We aimed to develop predictive models to identify estrogen receptor positive (ER+) and human epidermal growth factor negative (HER2-) early breast cancer (ESBC) and advanced stage breast cancer (ASBC) in a claims database.


METHODS
Female breast cancer cases in Anthem's Cancer Care Quality Program served as the gold standard validation sample. Predictive models were developed from clinical knowledge and empirically from claims data using logistic and lasso regression. Model performance was assessed by classification rates and c-statistics. Models were applied to the HealthCore Integrated Research Database (claims) to identify cohorts of women with ER+/HER2- ESBC and ASBC.


RESULTS
The validation sample included 3184 women with ER+/HER2- ESBC and 1436 with ER+/HER2- ASBC. Predictive models for ER+/HER2- ESBC and ASBC included 25 and 20 factors, respectively. Models had robust discrimination in identifying cases (c-statÂ =Â 0.92 for ESBC and 0.95 for ASBC). Compared with a traditional a priori algorithm developed with clinical insight alone, the ER+/HER2- ASBC-predictive model had better positive predictive value (PPV) (0.91, 95% CI, 0.90-0.93, vs 0.69, 95% CI, 0.66-0.73) and sensitivity (0.54 vs 0.35). Models were applied to the claims database to identify cohorts of 33Â 001 and 3198 women with ER+/HER2- ESBC and ASBC.


CONCLUSION
We conducted a validation study and developed predictive models to identify in a claims database cohorts of women with ER+/HER2- ESBC and ASBC. The models identified large cohorts in the claims data that can be used to characterize indications in the evaluation of targeted therapies.",2019,Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety
iTrade: An Adaptive Risk-Adjusted Intelligent Stock Trading System from the Perspective of Concept Drift,"In China stock market, more than 95% are non-professional investors. Due to the lack of professional skill and the complexity of financial indicators and the varying investment environment, non-professional investors are in great need of a data mining-based intelligent stock trading decision-support system. Considering the existence of concept drift phenomenon, this study proposes an adaptive learning process with the Lasso algorithm-based feature selection. Moreover, we use support vector machine as stock market predictor for stock selection and a risk-adjusted method for portfolio optimization. Finally, a web-based Adaptive Risk-adjusted Intelligent Stock Trading System (iTrade) is established. The seven-year (2005-2011) back-testing shows that our system can generate much higher cumulative return than the benchmark (Shanghai Composite Index) in China stock market. Meanwhile, concept drift analysis of adaptive relevant variable discovery process has revealed contrasting historical trends between two selected industries. In conclusion, the iTrade is suitable for non-professional investors in portfolio management, following the varying stock market environment and providing effective guidance.",2013,2013 Fourth International Conference on Emerging Intelligent Data and Web Technologies
"FÃ¼r eine Ontologie ohne Metaphysik, oder: Markus Gabriel verabschiedet einmal mehr die Welt","Seit geraumer Zeit geistern unter den Etiketten des Spekulativen Realismus und des Neuen Realismus Diskurse durch die akademischen wie auÃŸerakademischen Flure, die sich insgesamt auf die Fahnen geschrieben haben, die Wirklichkeit wieder ins philosophische Boot zu holen. Dabei stellt sich natÃ¼rlich die Frage, ob sie wirklich jemals Ã¼ber Bord gegangen ist. Der jÃ¼ngst verstorbene Hilary Putnam hat in seinem SpÃ¤twerk einen direkten Realismus vertreten, wie etwa John McDowells Arbeiten insgesamt darum kreisen, skeptische Intuitionen unter Verweis auf unsere unproblematische Offenheit gegenÃ¼ber der Welt zu demontieren. Insgesamt also arbeiten Positionen, die behaupten, der Philosophie sei die Wirklichkeit abhandengekommen, mindestens mit einem selektiven Blick noch auf die jÃ¼ngere Geschichte der Philosophie. Vielleicht lassen sich nicht zuletzt anhand dieser Frage der Neue Realismus, zu dessen Erfindern Markus Gabriel dem eigenen Bekunden nach gehÃ¶rt, und der Spekulative Realismus unterscheiden. WÃ¤hrend sich Quentin Meillassoux als sichtbarster Vertreter des Spekulativen Realismus unter Verwendung des Schlagworts des Korrelationismus auf eine entsprechende These der Wirklichkeitsvergessenheit der Philosophie festlegt und Autoren wie Kant, Hegel und Heidegger bei ihm letztlich nur noch als Karikaturen auftauchen, muss man Markus Gabriels Neuen Realismus vor diesem Vorwurf in Schutz nehmen. Er wirft der Philosophie nÃ¤mlich keineswegs vor, sie habe die Wirklichkeit vergessen, sondern vielmehr, sie habe diese nicht angemessen gedacht: Der Mainstream der Philosophie habe die ontologische Fragestellung, was es gibt, mit der metaphysischen Unterstellung verquickt, dass es eine â€žvereinheitliche TotalitÃ¤t dessen [gÃ¤be], was existiertâ€œ (24).

1 3 M ar 2 00 4 Ab-inito Linear Scaling Response Theory : Electric Polarizability by Perturbed Projection,"A linear scaling method for calculation of the static ab inito response within self-consistent field theory is developed and applied to calculation of the static electric polarizability. The method is based on density matrix perturbation theory [Niklasson and Challacombe, PRL (LJ9425)], obtaining response functions directly via a perturbative approach to spectral projection. The accuracy and efficiency of the linear scaling method is demonstrated for a series of three-dimensional water clusters at the RHF/6-31G** level of theory. Locality of the response under a global electric field perturbation is numerically demonstrated by approximate exponential decay of derivative density matrix elements.",2008,
Evolutionary adaptation to aquatic lifestyle in extinct sloths can lead to systemic alteration of bone structure,"Through phenotypic plasticity, bones can change in structure and morphology, in response to physiological and biomechanical influences over the course of individual life. Changes in bones also occur in evolution as functional adaptations to the environment. In this study, we report on the evolution of bone mass increase (BMI) that occurred in the postcranium and skull of extinct aquatic sloths. Although non-pathological BMI in postcranial skeleton has been known in aquatic mammals, we here document general BMI in the skull for the first time. We present evidence of thickening of the nasal turbinates, nasal septum and cribriform plate, further thickening of the frontals, and infilling of sinus spaces by compact bone in the late and more aquatic species of the extinct sloth Thalassocnus. Systemic bone mass increase occurred among the successively more aquatic species of Thalassocnus, as an evolutionary adaptation to the lineage's changing environment. The newly documented pachyostotic turbinates appear to have conferred little or no functional advantage and are here hypothesized as a correlation with or consequence of the systemic BMI among Thalassocnus species. This could, in turn, be consistent with a genetic accommodation of a physiological adjustment to a change of environment.",2018,Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences
Primary souring: a novel bacteria-free method for sour beer production,"In the beverage fermentation industry, especially at the craft or micro level, there is a movement to incorporate as many local ingredients as possible to both capture terroir and stimulate local economies. In the case of craft beer, this has traditionally only encompassed locally sourced barley, hops, and other agricultural adjuncts. The identification and use of novel yeasts in brewing lags behind. We sought to bridge this gap by bio-prospecting for wild yeasts, with a focus on the American Midwest. We isolated 284 different strains from 54 species of yeast and have begun to determine their fermentation characteristics. During this work, we found several isolates of five species that produce lactic acid and ethanol during wort fermentation: Hanseniaspora vineae, Lachancea fermentati, Lachancea thermotolerans, Schizosaccharomyces japonicus, and Wickerhamomyces anomalus. Tested representatives of these species yielded excellent attenuation, lactic acid production, and sensory characteristics, positioning them as viable alternatives to lactic acid bacteria (LAB) for the production of sour beers. Indeed, we suggest a new LAB-free paradigm for sour beer production that we term â€œprimary souringâ€ because the lactic acid production and resultant pH decrease occurs during primary fermentation, as opposed to kettle souring or souring via mixed culture fermentation.

Guiding functional connectivity estimation by structural connectivity in MEG: an application to discrimination of mild cognitive impaired conditions,"Whole brain resting state connectivity is a promising biomarker that might help to obtain an early diagnosis in many neurological diseases, such as dementia. Inferring resting-state connectivity is often based on correlations, which are sensitive to indirect connections, leading to an inaccurate representation of the real backbone of the network. The precision matrix is a better representation for whole brain connectivity, as it considers only direct connections. The network structure can be estimated using the graphical lasso (GL), which achieves sparsity through l1-regularization on the precision matrix. In this paper, we propose a structural connectivity adaptive version of the GL, where weaker anatomical connections are represented as stronger penalties on the corre- sponding functional connections. We applied beamformer source reconstruction to the resting state MEG record- ings of 81 subjects, where 29 were healthy controls, 22 were single-domain amnestic Mild Cognitive Impaired (MCI), and 30 were multiple-domain amnestic MCI. An atlas-based anatomical parcellation of 66 regions was ob- tained for each subject, and time series were assigned to each of the regions. The fiber densities between the re- gions, obtained with deterministic tractography from diffusion-weighted MRI, were used to define the anatomical connectivity. Precision matrices were obtained with the region specific time series in five different frequency bands. We compared our method with the traditional GL and a functional adaptive version of the GL, in terms of log-likelihood and classification accuracies between the three groups. We conclude that introduc- ing an anatomical prior improves the expressivity of the model and, in most cases, leads to a better classification between groups.",2014,
Outcome-adaptive lasso: Variable selection for causal inference.,"Methodological advancements, including propensity score methods, have resulted in improved unbiased estimation of treatment effects from observational data. Traditionally, a ""throw in the kitchen sink"" approach has been used to select covariates for inclusion into the propensity score, but recent work shows including unnecessary covariates can impact both the bias and statistical efficiency of propensity score estimators. In particular, the inclusion of covariates that impact exposure but not the outcome, can inflate standard errors without improving bias, while the inclusion of covariates associated with the outcome but unrelated to exposure can improve precision. We propose the outcome-adaptive lasso for selecting appropriate covariates for inclusion in propensity score models to account for confounding bias and maintaining statistical efficiency. This proposed approach can perform variable selection in the presence of a large number of spurious covariates, that is, covariates unrelated to outcome or exposure. We present theoretical and simulation results indicating that the outcome-adaptive lasso selects the propensity score model that includes all true confounders and predictors of outcome, while excluding other covariates. We illustrate covariate selection using the outcome-adaptive lasso, including comparison to alternative approaches, using simulated data and in a survey of patients using opioid therapy to manage chronic pain.",2017,Biometrics
"Palynological evidence for dating Jurassic-Cretaceous boundary sediments in the Bureya basin, Russian Far East","Palynological complexes from the coaliferous Talyndzhan and Dublikan formations of the Bureya sedimentary basin are analyzed. The palynological assemblage from the upper part of the Talyndzhan Formation is characterized by dominant gymnosperms largely close to Pinaceae and Ginkgocycadophytus. The content of ferns is insignificant against the background of their relatively high taxonomic diversity. The assemblage is marked by the last occurrence of Staplinisporites pocockii, Camptotriletes cerebriformis, C. nitida, and Cingulatisporites sanguinolentus spores typical of the Late Jurassic palynofloras. The palynological assemblage from the Dublikan Formation is dominated by Pteridophyts representing mainly by Cyathidites and Duplexisporites. In addition to the conifer, the role of Classopollis increased among the gymnosperms in this assemblage. It also includes the first-appearing Stereisporites bujargiensis, Neoraistrickia rotundiformis, Contignisporites dorsostriatus, Duplexisporites pseudotuberculatus, D. rotundatus, Appendicisporites tricostatus, and Concavissimisporites asper. These sporomorphs are characteristic of the Berriasian palynofloras.

"Paleoecological and paleoclimatical investigation of the Cretaceous- Paleocene strata of the Muglad Basin, Sudan","Palynoflora analysis of fifty-six samples from the Muglad Basin revealed the presence of terrestrially-derived palynomorphs dominated by diverse and well preserved pteridophyte-bryophyte spores, gymnosperms and less amount of angiosperm pollen. The association of abundant fern spores and Araucariaceae pollen in the Neocomian/Barremian through Albian might hint towards the presence of araucarian forests with herbaceous elements usually found along rivers or nearby freshwater lakes. Other possible members of the local lacustrine phytoplankton include Botryococcus sp ., Ovoidites sp . and the freshwater dinocyst "" Holmwoodinium notatum "" . These often occur in low/high abundance in Early to mid-Cretaceous assemblages in the study area. Ephedroid pollen and Classopollis consistently reported from Neocomian/Barremian through Albian/Cenomanian suggests seasonal or hinterland aridity, within the wide spread humid conditions. A late Cenomanian-Turonian dry period is also supported by the drastic decrease in the pteridophytic, hygrophilous elements at that time. A shift towards hot humid condition is evident during the Maastrichtian and Paleocene due to the existence of pollen assigned to Palmae group.",2011,
The Adaptive Lasso Method for Instrumental Variable Selection,Adaptive lasso is a weighted â€˜1 penalization method for simultaneous estimation and model selection. It has oracle properties of asymptotic normality with optimal convergence rate and model selection consistency. Instrumental variable selection has become the focus of much research in areas of application for which datasets with both strong and weak instruments are available. This paper develops an adaptive lasso method to select instrumental variables. We suggest standard two-stage least squares (TSLS) regression after the selection. Adaptive lasso is continuous and convex so that it can avoid the local optimization trap. In this paper we extend the technique of adaptive lasso to multivariate linear model framework and the situation in which we have weak instruments. Adaptive lasso estimates irrelevant instruments as 0 asymptotically as if it were known. In simulations we show adaptive lasso can select the strong instrumental variable consistently therefore improve the accuracy of the inference of TSLS.,2012,
"Visible Writings: Cultures, Forms, Readings ed. by Marija Dalbello and Mary Shaw (review)","performance, when signs now indicate that he turned instead to the plastic object of the book after 1895. Arnarâ€™s own insistence on the bookâ€™s part in MallarmÃ©â€™s emancipatory esthetic speaks to Quentin Meillassouxâ€™s metaphysics of chance diffusion. In my dissertation I argue that Northrop Fryeâ€™s charm/ riddle dichotomy better distinguishes the ritual function of stage from page than the public/ private binary that guides Arnarâ€™s hypothesis. The enigmatic book immerses individuals in a kind of unavowable or imagined community just as public as an opera, though in a different mode. Judged progressively, Arnarâ€™s research plays a key part in the general reevaluation of twentieth century critical theory and avant-garde esthetics, for which the print object is secondary to deconstructive poetic language. If negating and resisting bourgeois capitalist hegemony were a priority, one could only excuse deluxe editions as an ironical way for a writer to pay the bills, or as a counter-monument. The â€˜68er would not require Japanese paper to insist on materiality. By demonstrating MallarmÃ©â€™s serious interest in the artistâ€™s book as a leading public medium, rather than as a rebel harpoon launched from the underground, Arnarâ€™s research sympathizes with a more affirmative esthetic for fine arts and literature. In this vein she joins Lauren Silversâ€™ research on psycho-physiology and the Symbolist body esthetic, and R. Howard Blochâ€™s re-inscription of MallarmÃ© in the Augustinian and Platonic traditions (â€œAugustine, MallarmÃ©, and the Medieval Roots of Modernity,â€ MLN 127.5S[December 2012]:S6-S22 ). Furthermore, MallarmÃ©â€™s serious interest also challenges the twentieth century orthodoxy of medium specificity, which held MallarmÃ© as one pillar of purism. Arnarâ€™s focus on the hybrid media book joins recent work that relates his esthetic to the cinema (Wall-Romana), the graphic novel (Meillassouxâ€™s seminar), and Wagnerâ€™s Gesamtkunstwerk (David Roberts). Text and image do not have an ideal marriage nor a vengeful divorce, but share an open relationship that enjoys moments in new media and new contexts. It is no surprise that the University of Chicago Press produced Arnarâ€™s work in a fine edition. Embellished by a characteristic yet discreet design, with excellent illustrations gathered from diverse archives, its quality complements her rich study.",2013,MLN

Aberrant DNA methylation characterizes juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia with poor outcome.,"Aberrant DNA methylation contributes to the malignant phenotype in virtually all types of cancer, including myeloid leukemia. We hypothesized that CpG island hypermethylation also occurs in juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) and investigated whether it is associated with clinical, hematologic, or prognostic features. Based on quantitative measurements of DNA methylation in 127 JMML cases using mass spectrometry (MassARRAY), we identified 4 gene CpG islands with frequent hypermethylation: BMP4 (36% of patients), CALCA (54%), CDKN2B (22%), and RARB (13%). Hypermethylation was significantly associated with poor prognosis: when the methylation data were transformed into prognostic scores using a LASSO Cox regression model, the 5-year overall survival was 0.41 for patients in the top tertile of scores versus 0.72 in the lowest score tertile (P = .002). Among patients given allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, the 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse was 0.52 in the highest versus 0.10 in the lowest score tertile (P = .007). In multivariate models, DNA methylation retained prognostic value independently of other clinical risk factors. Longitudinal analyses indicated that some cases acquired a more extensively methylated phenotype at relapse. In conclusion, our data suggest that a high-methylation phenotype characterizes an aggressive biologic variant of JMML and is an important molecular predictor of outcome.",2011,Blood

An Novel Face Image Super-Resolution Based on Sparse Representation and Wasserstein Distance,"Face super-resolution has attracted much attention in recent years. Many algorithms have been proposed. However, these approaches only perform well under the condition that the input is noiseless or has small noise. These existing approaches think the measure of between LR and HR is Euclidean distance. Euclidean distance cannot measure well the condition that the image's pixel values tend to have random fluctuations of varying magnitudes or the image is represented as sparse high-dimensional data. In this paper, we propose a novel sparse representation and Wasserstein distance based face super-resolution approach that seem the measure of between LR and HR as Wasserstein distance. Specifically, we introduce the fused Lasso to the least squares representation of the input LR image in order to obtain a stable sparse representation, especially when the noise level of the input LR image is high. Experiments are carried out on the benchmark FERET face dataset. Visual and quantitative comparisons show that the proposed face super-resolution method achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art methods under noiseless condition, and yields superior super-resolution results when the input LR face image is contaminated by strong noise.",2018,2018 IEEE 4th International Conference on Computer and Communications (ICCC)
Radiomics analysis of multicenter CT images for discriminating mucinous adenocarcinoma from nomucinous adenocarcinoma in rectal cancer and comparison with conventional CT values.,"OBJECTIVE
To investigate the value of CT-based radiomics signature for preoperatively discriminating mucinous adenocarcinoma (MA) from nomucinous adenocarcinoma (NMA) in rectal cancer and compare with conventional CT values.


METHOD
A total of 225 patients with histologically confirmed MA or NMA of rectal cancer were retrospectively enrolled. Radiomics features were computed from the entire tumor volume segmented from the post-contrast phase CT images. The maximum relevance and minimum redundancy (mRMR) and LASSO regression model were performed to select the best preforming features and build the radiomics models using a training cohort of 155 cases. Then, predictive performance of the models was validated using a validation cohort of 70 cases and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis method. Meanwhile, CT values in post- and pre-contrast phase, as well as their difference (D-values) of tumors in two cohorts were measured by two radiologists. ROC curves were also calculated to assess diagnostic efficacies.


RESULTS
One hundred and sixty-three patients were confirmed by pathology as NMA and 62 cases were MA. The radiomics signature comprised 19 selected features and showed good discrimination performance in both the training and validation cohorts. The areas under ROC curves (AUC) are 0.93 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.89-0.98) in training cohort and 0.93 (95% CI: 0.87-0.99) in validation cohort, respectively. Three sets of CT values of MA in pre- and post-contrast phase, and their difference (D-value) (31Â±7.0, 51Â±12.6 and 20Â±9.3, respectively) were lower than those of NMA (37Â±5.6, 69Â±13.3 and 32Â±11.7, respectively). Comparing to the radiomics signature, using three sets of conventional CT values yielded relatively low diagnostic performance with AUC of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.78-0.88), 0.75 (95% CI: 0.69-0.81) and 0.78 (95% CI: 0.72-0.83), respectively.


CONCLUSION
This study demonstrated that CT radiomics features could be utilized as a noninvasive biomarker to identify MA patients from NMA of rectal cancer preoperatively, which is more accurate than using the conventional CT values.",2020,Journal of X-ray science and technology
U ÅºrÃ³dÅ‚a. RozwaÅ¼ania hydrauliczne,"The essay is a humble attempt at interpreting one sentence taken from Barbara Skarga's text ""On the Source and the Experience of Beginning"" comprised in her book A Metaphysical Quintet. The sentence, which reads ""Let us, however, begin at the source"", provides an excellent opportunity for considering the notion of ""beginning"" as well as the moment and place of first appearances of beings. These concepts inevitably lead us towards experiencing whole sequences of events, i.e. they alert us to the immediate urgency of the question of time. Starting from Barbara Skarga's sentence we would like to demonstrate - with the help of poets (Holderlin, Whitman), philosophers (Schelling, Derrida), and writers (Calvino, Calasso) - that the source only marks the beginning, does not coincide with it but functions as its sign. In consequence, in turn it also searches for its own ""beginning"", for its ""source"" in the depth of geological structures, thus becoming a threshold upon which the human experiences the non- and pre-human. Therefore, the experience of the source is not an affirmation of a radically separate and self-sufficient being, but just the opposite - it brings about the awareness of a profound connectedness of each individual being with, and therefore its thorough dependence on, the world which always precedes its appearance. While ""at the source"", we only recognize the fact of being on the way towards it.",2008,
"Joint power allocation, base station assignment and beamformer design for an uplink SIMO heterogeneous network","Consider the max-min problem for an uplink SIMO heterogeneous network, where the base stations (BS) are coordinated dynamically for joint reception under some backhaul overhead constraints. We formulate this problem in the perspective of joint power allocation, BS assignment and beamformer design, and develop an efficient algorithm based on alternating optimization. In particular, we transfer the joint BS assignment and beamformer design subproblem into a group LASSO problem by applying the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Consequently, the problem is solved in a partially distributed manner and in each iteration a simple closed-form solution is derived. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.",2014,"2014 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)"
"Thalassorhabdus alkalitolerans gen. nov., sp. nov., a novel Bacillaceae member isolated from marine sediment.","A novel Gram-stain-variable, rod-shaped, non-motile and non-endospore-forming bacterium (strain G27T) was isolated from near Dhuvaran, Gujarat, India. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, strain G27T was identified as a member of the class Firmibacteria and was most closely related to Bacillus populi FJAT-45347T (94.9â€Š% sequence similarity), Salipaludibacillus aurantiacus S9T (94.9â€Š%), Salipaludibacillus neizhouensis KCTC 13187T (94.7â€Š%), Alteribacillus iranensis DSM 23995T (94.6â€Š%) and other Firmibacteria (<94.6â€Š%). The DNA G+C content of strain G27T was 43.4Â±0.6â€‰mol%. The cell-wall peptidoglycan contained meso-diaminopimelic acid. Polar lipids included diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, one unidentified phospholipid and five unidentified lipids. The predominant isoprenoid quinone was menaquinone MK-7. Major fatty acids (>5â€Š%) included anteiso-C15:0, iso-C15â€Š:â€Š0, anteiso-C17:0, C16â€Š:â€Š0 and iso-C16â€Š:â€Š0. The results of phylogenetic, chemotaxonomic and biochemical tests allowed the clear differentiation of strain G27T from all other members of the family Bacillaceae.It is therefore considered to represent a novel species of a new genus, for which the name Thalassorhabdus alkalitolerans gen. nov., sp. nov., is proposed. The type strain of Thalassorhabdus alkalitolerans is G27T (=MCC 3411T=CGMCC 1.15772T=KCTC 33941T).",2018,International journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology
Radiomics for diagnosis of dual-phenotype hepatocellular carcinoma using Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI and patient prognosis,"To describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with dual-phenotype hepatocellular carcinoma (DPHCC) and investigate the use of radiomics to establish an image-based signature for preoperative differential diagnosis. This study included 50 patients with a postoperative pathological diagnosis of DPHCC (observation group) and 50 patients with CK7- and CK19-negative HCC (control group) who attended our hospital between January 2015 and December 2018. All patients underwent Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI within 1 month before surgery. Arterial phase (AP), portal venous phase (PVP), delayed phase (DP) and hepatobiliary phase (HBP) images were transferred into a radiomics platform. Volumes of interest covered the whole tumor. The dimensionality of the radiomics features were reduced using LASSO. Four classifiers, including multi-layer perceptron (MLP), support vector machines (SVM), logistic regression (LR) and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) were used to distinguish DPHCC from CK7- and CK19-negative HCC. Kaplanâ€“Meier survival analysis was used to assess 1-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in the observation and control groups. The best preoperative diagnostic power for DPHCC will likely be derived from a combination of different phases and classifiers. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of LR in PVP (0.740, 0.780, 0.766), DP (0.893, 0.700, 0.798), HBP (0.800, 0.720, 0.756) and MLP in PVP (0.880, 0.720, 0.798) were better performance. The 1-year DFS and OS of the patients in the observation group were 69% and 78%, respectively. The 1-year DFS and OS of the patients in the control group were 83% and 85%, respectively. Kaplanâ€“Meier survival analysis showed no statistical difference in DFS and OS between groups (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.231 and 0.326), but DFS and OS were numerically lower in patients with DPHCC. The radiomics features extracted from Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MR images can be used to diagnose preoperative DPHCC. DPHCC is more likely to recur and cause death than HCC, suggesting that active postoperative management of patients with DPHCC is required.",2019,Journal of Cancer Research and Clinical Oncology
A Visual Survey of the Inshore Fish Cos of Gran Canaria ( Canary Islands ),"An in situ visual survey technique (5 minutes and 100 mZ area) was used to assess the inshore fishes off Gran Canaria. In 1996,211 visual surveys were conducted at 7 localities. Locations differed significantly among each other with regards to the number of species per survey (ANOVA: p < 0.01). The Eve most abundant species were Chrornis limbanis, Boops boops, Ponzadasys incisus, Abzidefdz$irids, and Thalassorna pavo with respective mean abundances of 65.6, 37.4, 16.7, 8.7, and 4.5 per 100 m2. Detrended Correspondence Analysis, a multivariate ordination technique showed that the major determinant of community structure is substrate type. The majority of the surveyed species had low axis I ordination scores indicating a strong association with a hard substrate. The step-wise linear regression models explained 45.3 % and 1 1.4% of the variation in the first and second axis survey ordination scores, respectively.",2013,
"Physiological Ecology of Four Endemic Alabama Species and the Exotic Asiatic Weatherfish, Misgurnus anguillicaudatus (Cantor, 1842)","The occurrence of Asiatic Weatherfish, Misgurnus anguillicaudatus, in Alabama, a state known for its rich biodiversity, has generated concern among conservation managers. The current study used respirometry techniques to investigate the effects of increasing temperature on four native southeastern fishes (one cyprinid, two percids, and one elassomid) and the non-native M. anguillicaudatus. A minimum of five individuals of each species were used, and three experimental temperatures were chosen to represent spring and summer averages of northeast Alabama streams (15, 20, and 25Â°C). Overall, mean standard metabolic rates (SMRs) for M. anguillicaudatus were low (97.01, 127.75, and 158.50 mg O2 kg-1h-1 at 15, 20, and 25Â°C, respectively); M. anguillicaudatus was the only species for which SMR did not significantly increase with temperature (p = 0.467). In contrast, mean SMRs for all native species examined were higher than M. anguillicaudatus rates at a given temperature, and mean SMRs for Cyprinella caerulea, Etheostoma brevirostrum, and Etheostoma ditrema exhibited significant increases in SMR when temperatures were increased (e.g. 403.46, 704.42, and 1150.03 mg O2 kg-1h-1 at 25Â°C, respectively) (p < 0.01). Elassoma zonatum displayed highly significant increases in SMR when temperature increased from 15-20Â°C (p < 0.001). Overall, the abiotic tolerances of M. anguillicaudatus may facilitate further establishment that could lead to negative impacts on native species.",2017,
