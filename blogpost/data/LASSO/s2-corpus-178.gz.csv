Evaluation of random forest regression for prediction of breeding value from genomewide SNPs,"Genomic prediction is meant for estimating the breeding value using molecular marker data which has turned out to be a powerful tool for efficient utilization of germplasm resources and rapid improvement of cultivars. Model-based techniques have been widely used for prediction of breeding values of genotypes from genomewide association studies. However, application of the random forest (RF), a model-free ensemble learning method, is not widely used for prediction. In this study, the optimum values of tuning parameters of RF have been identified and applied to predict the breeding value of genotypes based on genomewide single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), where the number of SNPs (P variables) is much higher than the number of genotypes (n observations) (P > > n). Further, a comparison was made with the model-based genomic prediction methods, namely, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), ridge regression (RR) and elastic net (EN) under P > > n. It was found that the correlations between the predicted and observed trait response were 0.591, 0.539, 0.431 and 0.587 for RF, LASSO, RR and EN, respectively, which implies superiority of the RF over the model-based techniques in genomic prediction. Hence, we suggest that the RF methodology can be used as an alternative to the model-based techniques for the prediction of breeding value at genome level with higher accuracy.",2015,Journal of Genetics

Phenology-dependent variation in the non-structural carbohydrates of broadleaf evergreen species plays an important role in determining tolerance to defoliation (or herbivory),"Two broadleaf evergreen canopy species (Schima superba and Engelhardia roxburghiana) with different phenologies in a subtropical region of southern China were used to determine the influence of leaf phenology on the impact of an insect pest attack. S. superba regenerates its leaves in February, while E. roxburghiana regenerates its leaves in May. The moth Thalassodes quadraria attacked the two broadleaf evergreen species in March to April, and the newly produced leaves were removed for S. superba but not for E. roxburghiana. The young trees were artificially defoliated to imitate an insect pest attack during March 2014. Nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) and growth measurements and a retrospective analysis based on the radial growth of mature trees were conducted in January 2015. The results showed that NSC concentrations decreased in S. superba during canopy rebuilding, and the subsequent defoliation severely inhibited leaf and shoot growth, prevented NSC restoration in roots and stem xylem, and caused high mortality. The insect outbreaks reduced the radial growth of S. superba. In contrast, E. roxburghiana experienced less growth retardation, lower mortality, and normal radial growth. Thus, taking phenology-dependent variation in NSCs into consideration, defoliation and insect pest outbreaks more negatively impacted S. superba than E. roxburghiana.",2017,Scientific Reports

Sparse estimation based on a validation criterion,"A sparse estimator with close ties with the LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) is analysed. The basic idea of the estimator is to relax the least-squares cost function to what the least-squares method would achieve on validation data and then use this as a constraint in the minimization of the â„“1-norm of the parameter vector. In a linear regression framework, exact conditions are established for when the estimator is consistent in probability and when it possesses sparseness. By adding a re-estimation step, where least-squares is used to re-estimate the non-zero elements of the parameter vector, the so called Oracle property can be obtained, i.e. the estimator achieves the asymptotic CramÃ©r-Rao lower bound corresponding to when it is known which regressors are active. The method is shown to perform favourably compared to other methods on a simulation example.",2011,IEEE Conference on Decision and Control and European Control Conference
Complete hazard ranking to analyze right-censored data: An ALS survival study,"Survival analysis represents an important outcome measure in clinical research and clinical trials; further, survival ranking may offer additional advantages in clinical trials. In this study, we developed GuanRank, a non-parametric ranking-based technique to transform patients' survival data into a linear space of hazard ranks. The transformation enables the utilization of machine learning base-learners including Gaussian process regression, Lasso, and random forest on survival data. The method was submitted to the DREAM Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Stratification Challenge. Ranked first place, the model gave more accurate ranking predictions on the PRO-ACT ALS dataset in comparison to Cox proportional hazard model. By utilizing right-censored data in its training process, the method demonstrated its state-of-the-art predictive power in ALS survival ranking. Its feature selection identified multiple important factors, some of which conflicts with previous studies.",2017,PLoS Computational Biology

Not by Nature but by Grace: Forming Families through Adoption by Gilbert C. Meilaender (review),"emphasis on covenant does justice to the law/gospel dialectic. In a related concern, the section on the Ten Commandments at the end of the volume seems to reflect Calvinâ€™s stress on the third use of the law, something that Lutherans have been historically reluctant to affirm.

Exome Analysis Reveals Genomic Markers Associated with Better Efficacy of Nivolumab in Lung Cancer Patients.,"PURPOSE
Immune checkpoint inhibitors revolutionized the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, only one-quarter of patients benefit from these new therapies. PD-L1 assessment and tumor mutational burden (TMB) are available tools to optimize use of checkpoint inhibitors but novel tools are needed. Exome sequencing could generate many variables but their role in identifying predictors of response is unknown.


EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
We performed somatic and constitutional exome analyses for 77 patients with NSCLC treated with nivolumab. We studied: one-tumor-related characteristics: aneuploidy, CNA clonality, mutational signatures, TMB, mutations in WNT, AKT, MAPK, and DNA repair pathways, and two-immunologic characteristics: number of intratumoral TCR clones, HLA types, and number of neoantigens; and six clinical parameters.


RESULTS
A high TMB per Mb, a high number of neoantigens, mutational signatures 1A and 1B, mutations in DNA repair pathways, and a low number of TCR clones are associated with greater PFS. Using a LASSO method, we established an exome-based model with nine exome parameters that could discriminate patients with good or poor PFS (P < 0.0001) and overall survival (P = 0.002). This model shows better ability to predict outcomes compared with a PD-L1 clinical model with or without TMB. It was externally validated on two cohorts of patients with NSCLC treated with pembrolizumab or with nivolumab and ipilimumab as well as in urothelial tumors treated with atezolizumab.


CONCLUSIONS
Altogether, these data provide a validated biomarker that predicts the efficacy of nivolumab or pembrolizumab in patients with NSCLC. Our biomarker seems to be superior to PD-L1 labeling and TMB models.",2019,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research
Using graphical adaptive lasso approach to construct transcription factor and microRNA's combinatorial regulatory network in breast cancer.,"Discovering the regulation of cancer-related gene is of great importance in cancer biology. Transcription factors and microRNAs are two kinds of crucial regulators in gene expression, and they compose a combinatorial regulatory network with their target genes. Revealing the structure of this network could improve the authors' understanding of gene regulation, and further explore the molecular pathway in cancer. In this article, the authors propose a novel approach graphical adaptive lasso (GALASSO) to construct the regulatory network in breast cancer. GALASSO use a Gaussian graphical model with adaptive lasso penalties to integrate the sequence information as well as gene expression profiles. The simulation study and the experimental profiles verify the accuracy of the authors' approach. The authors further reveal the structure of the regulatory network, and explore the role of feedforward loops in gene regulation. In addition, the authors discuss the combinatorial regulatory effect between transcription factors and microRNAs, and select miR-155 for detailed analysis of microRNA's role in cancer. The proposed GALASSO approach is an efficient method to construct the combinatorial regulatory network. It also provides a new way to integrate different data sources and could find more applications in meta-analysis problem.",2014,IET systems biology
Quantification of differences in resistance to gastrointestinal nematode infections in sheep using a multivariate blood parameter.,"Breeding for resistance to gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN) in sheep relies largely on the use of worm egg counts (WEC) to identify animals that are able to resist infection. As an alternative to such measures of parasite load we aimed to develop a method to identify animals showing resistance to GIN infection based on the impact of the infection on blood parameters. We hypothesized that blood parameters may provide a measure of infection level with a blood-feeding parasite through perturbation of red blood cell parameters due to feeding behaviour of the parasite, and white blood cell parameters through the mounting of an immune response in the host animal. We measured a set of blood parameters in 390 sheep that had been exposed to an artificial regime of repeated challenges with Trichostrongylus colubriformis followed by Haemonchus contortus. A simple analysis revealed strong relationships between single blood parameters and WECs with correlation coefficients -0.54 to -0.60. We then used more complex multi-variate methods based on supervised classifier models (including Bayesian Network) as well as regression models (Lasso and Elastic Net) to study the relationships between WECs and blood parameters, and derived algorithms describing the relationships. The ability of these algorithms to classify sheep GIN resistance status was tested using the WEC and blood parameters collected from a different group of 418 sheep that had acquired natural infections of H. contortus from pasture. We identified the most resistant and most susceptible animals (10% percentiles) of this group based on WECs, and then compared the identities of these animals to the identities of animals that were predicted to be most resistant and most susceptible by our algorithms. The models showed varying abilities to predict susceptible and resistant sheep, with up to 65% of the most susceptible animals and 30% of the most resistant animals identified by the Elastic Net model algorithms. The prediction algorithms derived from female sheep data performed better than those for male sheep in some cases, with the predicted animals accounting for up to 50-60% of the actual resistant and susceptible female animals. Heritability values were calculated for blood parameters and the aggregate trait descriptions defined by the novel prediction algorithms. The aggregate trait descriptions were moderately heritable and may therefore be suitable for use in genetic selection strategies. The present study indicates that multivariate models based on blood parameter data showed some ability to predict the resistance status of sheep to infection with H. contortus.",2019,Veterinary parasitology
Sparse Ultra Wide Band Radar imaging in a locally adapting matching pursuit (LAMP) framework,"Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) Impulse Radar imaging finds widespread applications in extending human vision beyond media that cannot be penetrated by visible light. However, high resolution imaging demands acquisition of large amounts of data, which has motivated researchers towards the application of Compressed Sensing techniques in radar imaging, if the target space is sparse. It might be noted that apart from sparsity, most UWB radar signatures also exhibit another property of being clustered into groups that conventional sparse reconstruction techniques like Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) or Lasso rarely take into account. Though attempts have been made to reconstruct block sparse signals using BlockOMP or Group Lasso, these algorithms inherently assume specific locations and sizes of the possible clusters, and hence are not satisfactory if the clusters are randomly located and variably sized. In this manuscript, the traditional block based approach has been extended for Multiple Measurement Vector (MMV) model. To address its shortcomings, a novel framework that is referred to as a locally adapting matching pursuit (LAMP) has been proposed for the efficient reconstruction of radar signatures from compressed measurements considering both sparsity and clustering priors, but without assuming any specific group structure like BOMP or Group Lasso. The performance of the proposed LAMP has been compared with existing algorithms in different scenarios. The framework has also been successfully applied on a real-world radar imaging data, with different types of sensing matrices.",2015,2015 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarCon)

Hidden Writing,"Reza Negarestaniâ€™s Cyclonopedia: Complicity with Anonymous Materials is weird, not only because its monstrous and nonhuman tenor resonates with the weird fictions of China MiÃ©ville and H. P. Lovecraft, or the weird realities conjured by the philosophers of speculative realism; Cyclonopedia ungrounds and mutilates the very genres of horror, philosophy, and author, leaving in their wake what some have called para-academic theory-fiction. It is precisely the weirdness of both Cyclonopedia and Negarestani that has captivated so manyâ€”the text has become an inspiration to academics and intellectuals, spiraling out into the disciplines of media theory, continental philosophy, queer theory, and political thought; the creative industries of architecture and the arts have also embraced the text (Artforum International listed Cyclonopedia in its Best of 2009 issue), either making work as a direct response to Cyclonopedia or collaborating with Negarestani. A 2011 Cyclonopedia symposium at The New School in New York City brought these splintering engagements together, demonstrating the profound and varied impact the book is continuing to make. Arguably more perplexing than the text is the enigmatic figure of Negarestani himself. An illusive persona based in Iran, Negarestani maintains an active blog and Facebook profile, yet debates have raged on as to whether he actually exists: Who or what is/are Reza Negarestani? Is he real or an invention? This anxiety over the existence of Negarestani is exactly how Cyclonopedia begins. In the foreword, Kristen Alvanson documents her journey to Istanbul to meet an online friend. As she searches for this ultimately unlocatable person, she discovers a manuscript labeled Cyclonopedia by Reza Negarestani. After several unsuccessful attempts at making contact with Negarestani, Alvanson returns to the U.S. with Cyclonopedia, intent on publishing itâ€”or so we are told. Cyclonopedia is an examination of the works and writings of the fictional Dr. Hamid Parsani, a former archaeology and mathematics professor at Tehran University, who was exiled for â€œinsufficient scholarshipâ€ and soon after mysteriously disappeared. Parsaniâ€™s bizarrely esoteric research explores Middle Eastern theologies and ancient occult relics, as well Attending to nonhuman, or anonymous, materials in Cyclonopedia reveals not only new political formations and schisms but also provides an original contribution to the so-called nonhuman and speculative turns. These philosophical movements typically center on the question of how to gain access to that which exists outside of the correlates of human being and world. For example, French philosopher Quentin Meillassoux (in After Finitude: An Essay on the Necessity of Contingency [2010]) uses mathematics to achieve this, and media theorist Ian Bogost (in Alien Phenomenology, or What Itâ€™s Like to Be a Thing [2012]) develops an alien phenomenology. While these projects all raise slight methodological and disciplinary concerns, Cyclonopedia exhilaratingly radicalizes this with a practice called Hidden Writing. Negarestani claims that the Middle East requires a new political analysis, one that is material and concrete. Following this, he proposes Hidden Writing, described as a model of complicity with Parsaniâ€™s conception of the â€œ( )hole complex,â€ suggesting that stories be read only through plot holes. This writing involves both inauthenticity, which Negarestani associates with interference from collective writing practices, and steganography, a technique in which the main plot is designed to camouflage other plots. Hidden Writing, therefore, as their relation to the contemporary War on Terror. Parsani writes about bacterial archeology, polytics, the Tellurian Omega, and Xerodrome, producing a challenging codex though which to think about the Middle East. Throughout Cyclonopedia, Negarestani employs Parsaniâ€™s corpus to explore warfare, demons, decay, and the destruction of the Earth. Crucially, Parsani and Negarestani shift the locus of political agency in their work to nonhuman materials. Thus, when war in the Middle East is discussed, one must account for dust; or when political power is considered, one must account for material decay. As Parsani says, â€œThe Middle East is a sentient entityâ€”it is alive!â€ Parsani/Negarestaniâ€™s words read like a materialist geo-philosophy meets horror novel.",2012,American Book Review
Drosophila Stage Annotation using Sparse Learning Method,"Drosophila melanogaster, as an important model organism, is used to explore the mechanism which governs cell differentiation and embryonic development. Understanding the mechanism will help to reveal the effects of genes on other species or even human beings. Currently, digital camera techniques make high quality Drosophila gene expression imaging possible. On the other hand, due to the advances in biology, gene expression images which can reveal spatiotemporal patterns are generated in a high-throughput pace. Thus, an automated and efficient system that can analyze gene expression will become a necessary tool for investigating the gene functions, interactions and developmental processes. One investigation method is to compare the expression patterns of different developmental stages. Recently, however, the expression patterns are manually annotated with rough stage ranges. The work of annotation requires professional knowledge from experienced biologists. Hence, how to transfer the domain knowledge in biology into an automated system which can automatically annotate the patterns provides a challenging problem for computer scientists. In this thesis, the problem of stage annotation for Drosophila embryo is modeled in the machine learning framework. Three sparse learning algorithms and one ensemble algorithm are used to attack the problem. The sparse algorithms are Lasso, group Lasso and sparse group Lasso. The ensemble algorithm is based on a voting method. Besides that the proposed algorithms can annotate the patterns to stages instead of stage ranges with high accuracy; the decimal stage annotation algorithm presents a novel way to annotate the patterns to decimal stages. In addition, some analysis on the algorithm performance are made and corresponding explanations are given. Finally, with the proposed system, all the lateral view BDGP and FlyFish images are annotated and several interesting applications of decimal stage value are revealed.",2012,
Extensions of Morse-Smale Regression with Application to Actuarial Science,"The problem of subgroups is ubiquitous in scientific research (ex. disease heterogeneity, spatial distributions in ecology...), and piecewise regression is one way to deal with this phenomenon. Morse-Smale regression offers a way to partition the regression function based on level sets of a defined function and that function's basins of attraction. This topologically-based piecewise regression algorithm has shown promise in its initial applications, but the current implementation in the literature has been limited to elastic net and generalized linear regression. It is possible that nonparametric methods, such as random forest or conditional inference trees, may provide better prediction and insight through modeling interaction terms and other nonlinear relationships between predictors and a given outcome. 
This study explores the use of several machine learning algorithms within a Morse-Smale piecewise regression framework, including boosted regression with linear baselearners, homotopy-based LASSO, conditional inference trees, random forest, and a wide neural network framework called extreme learning machines. Simulations on Tweedie regression problems with varying Tweedie parameter and dispersion suggest that many machine learning approaches to Morse-Smale piecewise regression improve the original algorithm's performance, particularly for outcomes with lower dispersion and linear or a mix of linear and nonlinear predictor relationships. On a real actuarial problem, several of these new algorithms perform as good as or better than the original Morse-Smale regression algorithm, and most provide information on the nature of predictor relationships within each partition to provide insight into differences between dataset partitions.",2017,arXiv: Machine Learning
LLASSO: A linear unified LASSO for multicollinear situations,"We propose a rescaled LASSO, by premultipying the LASSO with a matrix term, namely linear unified LASSO (LLASSO) for multicollinear situations. Our numerical study has shown that the LLASSO is comparable with other sparse modeling techniques and often outperforms the LASSO and elastic net. Our findings open new visions about using the LASSO still for sparse modeling and variable selection. We conclude our study by pointing that the LLASSO can be solved by the same efficient algorithm for solving the LASSO and suggest to follow the same construction technique for other penalized estimators.",2017,arXiv: Methodology

Malignancy Texture Classification in Digital Mammograms based on Chebyshev Moments and Logpolar Transformation,A method for selecting a three-dimensional object in a three-dimensional environment improves a speed and efficiency of a lassoing technique. The method reduces the number of objects that have to be rendered into images in order to determine whether the object is included within an area selected by the lasso. The method selects objects intersected by the lasso using ray picking. These selected objects are not rendered into images. The method determines those objects whose bounding boxes do not intersect a bounding box of the area selected by the lasso. These objects are also not rendered into images. The method renders the remaining objects into images to determine which are included with the area selected by the lasso.,2007,
A four-DNA methylation signature as a novel prognostic biomarker for survival of patients with gastric cancer,"Gastric cancer (GC) is the fifth most frequently diagnosed cancer and the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality. Lack of prognostic indicators for patient survival hinders GC treatment and survival. Methylation profile data of patients with GC obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were analyzed to identify methylation sites as biomarkers for GC prognosis. The cohort was divided into training and validation sets. Univariate Cox, LASSO regression,and multivariate Cox analyses revealed a close correlation of a four-DNA methylation signature as a risk score model with the overall survival of patients with GC. The survival between high-risk and low-risk score patients with GC was significantly different. Analyses of receiver operating characteristics revealed a high prognostic accuracy of the four-DNA methylation signature in patients with GC. The subgroup analysis indicated that the accuracy included that for anatomical region, histologic grade, TNM stage, pathological stage, and sex. The GC prognosis based on the four-DNA methylation signature was more precise than that based on known biomarkers. The four-DNA methylation signature could serve as a novel independent prognostic factor that could be an important tool to predict the prognostic outcome of GC patients. This potential must be verified in a large-scale population cohort study and through basic research studies.",2020,Cancer Cell International
A Sparse Model of Guided Wave Tomography for Corrosion Mapping in Structure Health Monitoring Applications,"To improve the reconstruction image spatial resolutions of ultrasonic guided wave ray tomography, a sparse model, based on the differences between the inspected and original slowness of the ultrasonic guided waves propagating in the plate-like or pipe-like materials, is first proposed in this paper. Unlike the conventional ultrasonic guided wave tomography whose reconstruction image resolutions are limited by an underdetermined linear model, analyses show that our new model, although it is also underdetermined, can give the optimal solution of the reconstruction image when the constraints on the sparsity of the slowness difference distribution are valid. The reason for the validation of the sparse constraints on the corrosions of the materials is explained. Based on our new model, a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) approach to do the thickness change mapping of a structure health monitoring (SHM) application is then formulated. Analyses also show that the visible artifacts can be avoided using our method, and the spatial resolutions of reconstruction image by our approach can further be improved by increasing the number of grids in the calculation. The approach is validated by experimental work on an aluminum plate. It is also shown that compared to the conventional ray tomography, the presented method can achieve a relatively high spatial resolution, with good suppression of artifacts.",2019,Applied Sciences

"Essays on Forecasting Financial Markets Using Decomposition, Constraints and Extreme Learning Machines","Chapter 1 and 2 discuss how to use a decomposition model to make a density forecast of the financial return and how to improve this density forecast by imposing matching moment constraints. The density forecast model is based on a decomposition of financial returns into the absolute return and the sign of the return. We also use the maximum entropyprinciple for the out-of-sample density forecast subject to the constraintthat matches the mean forecasts from the decomposition model and a simple regression model. In Chapter 1 (joint with Professor Tea-Hwy Lee),We show that when the mean forecast from the decomposition model deviates from that of the mean return, imposing the matching mean forecast constraint will tilt the density forecast of the decomposition model and improve over the density forecast of the original decomposition model. In Chapter 2 (joint with Professor Tae-Hwy Lee and Ru Zhang), we further improve the decomposition model by using dependent copula functions, and we show that the risk forecast produced by the decomposition density forecast model is superior to RiskMetrics in terms of giving higher coverage probability and lower predictive quanitle loss in extreme events of large loss for monthly returns.Chapter 3 and 4 (joint with Professor Tae-Hwy Lee and Ru Zhang) deal with the testing of nonlinearity of time series data by using artificial neural network (ANN). In Chapter 3, we find that the original Lee, White and Granger (LWG, 1993) test is sensitive to the randomly generated activation parameters since they consider a fairly small number (10 or 20) of random hidden unit activations. To solve this problem, we simply increase the number of randomized hidden unit activations to a very large number (e.g., 1000). We show that using many randomly generated activation parameters can robustify the performance of the ANN test when it is applied to a real empirical data. This robustification is reliable and useful in practice, and can be achieved at no cost as increasing the number of random activations is almost costless given todayihs computer technology. In Chapter 4, we further consider different types of regularization of the dimensionality, such as principal component analysis (PCA), Lasso, Pretest, partial least squares (PLS), among others. We demonstrate that while these supervised regularization methods such as Lasso, Pretest, PLS, may be useful for forecasting, they may not be used for testing because the supervised regularization would create the post-sample inference or post-selection inference (PoSI) problem. Our Monte Carlo simulation shows that the PoSI problem is especially severe with PLS and Pretest while it seems relatively mild or even negligible with Lasso.",2013,
"Biodegradation of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (pah), Phenanthrene by Marine Bacterium Thalassospira Sp. C.260","Phenanthrene is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) compound that is known to be reported toxic to marine flora and fauna. Remediation of this environmental pollutant using chemical and physical methods causes environmental issues. Bioremediation using marine has been applied to degrade such various PAH compounds. Screening of marine microorganism in degrading this recalcitrant is very importance for bioremediation application in Indonesian waters. The purpose of this study was to screen and isolate bacterial with potential application in biodegradation of phenanthrene and other harmful PAH in marine environments. Several potential bacteria strains were isolated from oil contaminated sea water in Cilacap area. Sequence analysis using 16S rRNA gene marine bacterium strain C.260 showed 96% sequence homology to sequence of Thalassospira sp. In biodegradation of phenanthrene, within 28 days experiments, this bacterium degraded 50% and 99.75% of phenanthrene in medium with and without enrichment with NPK fertilizer respectively. Using sublimation method, this bacterium also degradeds phenothiazine, fluoranthene, and dibenzothiophene.",2014,
Measuring Visual Field Progression in the Central 10 Degrees Using Additional Information from Central 24 Degrees Visual Fields and â€˜Lasso Regressionâ€™,"PURPOSE
To measure progression of the visual field (VF) mean deviation (MD) index in longitudinal 10-2 VFs more accurately, by adding information from 24-2 VFs using Lasso regression.


METHODS
A training dataset consisted of 138 eyes from 97 patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension and a testing dataset consisted of 40 eyes from 34 patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The Lasso method was used to predict total deviation (TD) values in training patients' 10-2 VFs based on information from their 24-2 VFs (52 TD values, foveal sensitivity and mean deviation MD). Then, the MD of each patient's 10-2 VF was estimated as the average of these Lasso-predicted TD values (10-2 VF 'Lasso MD'; LMD). Finally, linear regression was applied to each testing patient's series of longitudinal 10-2 VF MDs with and without additional Lasso-derived LMDs in order to predict future MDs not included in the regression analysis. Absolute prediction errors were compared when only actual 10-2 MDs were regressed against when a combination of actual 10-2 MDs and LMDs were regressed.


RESULTS
THE AVERAGE ABSOLUTE PREDICTION ERROR WAS SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER FOR THE NOVEL METHOD INCORPORATING LMDS (RANGE: 1.6 to 1.8 dB) compared with the standard approach (range: 1.7 to 3.4 dB) (p<0.05, ANOVA test).


CONCLUSIONS
Deriving 10-2 VF MD values from 24-2 VFs improves the prediction accuracy of progression. This approach will help clinicians to predict patients' visual function in the parafoveal area.",2013,PLoS ONE
The predictive power of the business and bank sentiment of firms: A high-dimensional Granger Causality approach,"We study the predictive power of industry-specific economic sentiment indicators for future macro-economic developments. In addition to the sentiment of firms towards their own business situation, we study their sentiment with respect to the banking sector - their main credit providers. The use of industry-specific sentiment indicators results in a high-dimensional forecasting problem. To identify the most predictive industries, we present a bootstrap Granger Causality test based on the Adaptive Lasso. This test is more powerful than the standard Wald test in such high-dimensional settings. Forecast accuracy is improved by using only the most predictive industries rather than all industries.",2016,Eur. J. Oper. Res.
Nearest neighbor ensembles for functional data with interpretable feature selection,"Abstract Functional data becomes increasingly common in many fields of application. Although much research has been done on functional regression and clustering approaches for chemometric data, so far few classification methods exist. This paper introduces an ensemble method for classification that inherently provides automatic and interpretable feature selection. It is designed for single as well as multiple functional (and non-functional) covariates. The ensemble members are posterior probability estimates that are based on a k-nearest-neighbor approach. The ensemble allows for feature selection by including members that are calculated from various semi-metrics used in the k-nearest-neighbor approach, where a particular semi-metric represents a specific curve feature. Each ensemble member, and thus each curve feature, is weighted by an unknown coefficient. These coefficients are estimated using a proper scoring rule with implicit Lasso-type penalty, such that some coefficients can be estimated to be exactly zero. Thus, the ensemble automatically provides feature selection, and also, in the case of multiple functional (and non-functional) covariates, variable selection. The selection performance and the interpretability of the coefficients are investigated in simulation studies. Data of a cell chip used for water quality monitoring experiments is examined. Here, the relevance of especially the feature selection aspect of the ensemble is illustrated.",2015,Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems
Compressed sensing of time-varying signals,"Compressed sensing (CS) lowers the number of measurements required for reconstruction and estimation of signals that are sparse when expanded over a proper basis. Traditional CS approaches deal with time-invariant sparse signals, meaning that, during the measurement process, the signal of interest does not exhibit variations. However, many signals encountered in practice are varying with time as the observation window increases (e.g., video imaging, where the signal is sparse and varies between different frames). The present paper develops CS algorithms for time-varying signals, based on the least-absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) that has been popular for sparse regression problems. The Lasso here is tailored for smoothing time-varying signals, which are modeled as vector valued discrete time series. Two algorithms are proposed: the Group-Fused Lasso, when the unknown signal support is time-invariant but signal samples are allowed to vary with time; and the Dynamic Lasso, for the general class of signals with time-varying amplitudes and support. Performance of these algorithms is compared with a sparsity-unaware Kalman smoother, a support-aware Kalman smoother, and the standard Lasso which does not account for time variations. The numerical results amply demonstrate the practical merits of the novel CS algorithms.",2009,2009 16th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing
THU0051â€…Association between bioactive tnf and eular response to tnf inhibitors in rheumatoid arthritis,"Background ROC study provided data to manage rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment after a failure to a first TNF blocker (1). We previously reported that high circulating TNF bioactivity was associated with good clinical response (2). Objectives To explore ability of TNF bioactivity to predict response to second TNF blocker. Methods Here, we assessed TNF bioactivity in 130 RA patients from the group rotation to a second TNF blocker at the time of randomisation and after 6 months. Clinical and biological data were recorded at baseline and 6 month with Eular response assessed at 6 month. TNF bioactivity was assessed with HEK-Dual TNF cells adapted from our previous work (2). Due to non-normalised distribution, non parametrical analysis were performed. Results Baseline circulating TNF bioactivity was similar according to Eular response. However, circulating TNF bioactivity at 6 month was associated with clinical response with low TNF bioactivity in responders. A ROC analysis suggested a cut-off at 0.320 with a sensitivity at 92% and a specificity at 41%. Conclusions After a failure of a first TNF blocker, circulating TNF bioactivity is not able to predict response to a second TNF blocker despite a lower level in responders compared to non-responders.

Asymptotically Exact Denoising in Relation to Compressed Sensing,"We consider the denoising problem where we wish to estimate a structured signal x0 from corrupted observations y = x0 + z. Typical structures include sparsity, block sparsity and low rankness. We use a structure inducing convex function f and solve minx 1 2 â€–yâˆ’xâ€–2 +Î»f(x) to estimate x0. For example, f(Â·) is the `1 norm for sparse vectors, `1 âˆ’ `2 norm for block-sparse signals and it is the nuclear norm for low rank matrices. When the noise vector z is i.i.d. Gaussian, we show that the normalized estimation error (MSE) of the optimally tuned problem coincides with the compressed sensing phase transitions, i.e., the number âˆ†f (x0) so that one needs m > âˆ†f (x0) compressed observations Ax0 âˆˆ R to recover x0 by solving minAx=Ax0 f(x). âˆ†f (x0) can be given as an explicit formula based on the subdifferential of f(Â·) at x0. We then connect our results to the generalized LASSO problem in which we have m noisy compressed observations y = Ax0 + z âˆˆ R and solve minf(x)â‰¤f(x0) â€–yâˆ’Axâ€– 2 2. We show that, certain properties of the LASSO problem is closely related to the same quantity âˆ†f (x0) and we give an explicit formula for the objective value of the LASSO minimization. Under certain assumptions, we show that the normalized LASSO objective is around max{mâˆ’âˆ†f (x0), 0} with high probability. This illustrates a phase transition behavior for the LASSO problem. In summary, our results provide exact analysis of several aspects of the denoising problem and show a close connection between two apparently unrelated problems in a general setup: The estimation of a signal from noisy observations and the recovery of the same signal from compressed observations. A single quantity âˆ†f (x0) is able to capture some of the critical aspects of both problems.",2013,ArXiv
Aspects of Seagrass Ecology along the Eastern Coast of the Red Sea,"Results of ecological observations on seagrasses at 772 sites along the Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia and North Yemen are presented. Nine of the 11 seagrass species known for the Red Sea were identified during the survey. Overall seagrass abundance (all species together) showed significant inverse correlation with latitude. The abundance of Halophila ovalis, Halodule uninervis, Thalassia hemprichii, Cymodocea spp. and Enhalus acoroides all increased significantly towards the south. The reverse pattern was observed for Halophila stipulacea, Syringodium isoetifolium and Thalassodendron ciliatum. Probable factors influencing seagrass distribution and abundance are discussed. Cluster analysis was used firstly for distinguishing seagrass assemblages of the eastern Red Sea at a broad level, and revealed three groupings separating recognisably according to latitude. To further define community structure, cluster analysis was performed on data from 212 individual sites in the southern region and indicated 6 distinctive assemblages. Each can be characterised according to species composition and associated coastal features. Limited sampling of the seagrass biota provided an initial assessment of the more commonly associated species. Molluscs (e.g. Cerithium scabridum and Strombus tricornis) accounted for the majority of associated species. Juvenile fish and penaeid shrimps were also important. Surveys investigating seagrasses and associated biotic ro uc on assemblages have been conducted mainly in northern Many of the biological studies in the Red Sea have parts of the Red Sea, including the Gulf of Aqaba focused on coral reefs, beginning in the 18th century (Hulings 19.79, Lipkin 1979, Wahbeh 1980, 1981, (Forsskal 1775), and continuing to the present (e.g. Wahbeh and Mahasnah 1985, Hulings and Kirkman Bemert and Ormond 1981, Scheer and Pillai 1983, 1982, Jacobs and Dicks 1985).

Multi-View Exclusive Unsupervised Dimension Reduction for Video-Based Facial Expression Recognition,"Video-based facial expression recognition (FER) has recently received increased attention as a result of its widespread application. Many kinds of features have been proposed to represent different properties of facial expressions in videos. However the dimensionality of these features is usually high. In addition, due to the complexity of the information available in video sequences, using only one type of feature is often inadequate. How to effectively reduce the dimensionality and combine multi-view features thus becomes a challenging problem. In this paper, motivated by the recent success in exclusive feature selection, we first introduce exclusive group LASSO (EG-LASSO) to unsupervised dimension reduction (UDR). This leads to the proposed exclusive UDR (EUDR) framework, which allows arbitrary sparse structures on the feature space. To properly combine multiple kinds of features, we further extend EUDR to multi-view EUDR (MEUDR), where the structured sparsity is enforced at both intra- and interview levels. In addition, combination weights are learned for all views to allow them to contribute differently to the final consensus presentation. A reliable solution is then obtained. Experiments on two challenging video-based FER datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",2016,
The biglasso Package: A Memory- and Computation-Efficient Solver for Lasso Model Fitting with Big Data in R,"Penalized regression models such as the lasso have been extensively applied to analyzing high-dimensional data sets. However, due to memory limitations, existing R packages like glmnet and ncvreg are not capable of fitting lasso-type models for ultrahigh-dimensional, multi-gigabyte data sets that are increasingly seen in many areas such as genetics, genomics, biomedical imaging, and high-frequency finance. In this research, we implement an R package called biglasso that tackles this challenge. biglasso utilizes memory-mapped files to store the massive data on the disk, only reading data into memory when necessary during model fitting, and is thus able to handle out-of-core computation seamlessly. Moreover, it's equipped with newly proposed, more efficient feature screening rules, which substantially accelerate the computation. Benchmarking experiments show that our biglasso package, as compared to existing popular ones like glmnet, is much more memory- and computation-efficient. We further analyze a 31 GB real data set on a laptop with only 16 GB RAM to demonstrate the out-of-core computation capability of biglasso in analyzing massive data sets that cannot be accommodated by existing R packages.",2017,arXiv: Computation

Derivation of a simple postoperative delirium incidence and severity prediction model,"Background: Delirium is an important postoperative complication, yet a simple and effective delirium prediction model remains elusive. We hypothesized that the combination of the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) risk calculator for serious complications (NSQIP-SC) or risk of death (NSQIP-D), and cognitive tests of executive function (Trail Making Test A and B [TMTA, TMTB]), could provide a parsimonious model to predict postoperative delirium incidence or severity. Methods: Data were collected from 100 adults (>65yo) undergoing major non-cardiac surgery. In addition to NSQIP-SC, NSQIP-D, TMTA and TMTB, we collected participant age, sex, ASA score, tobacco use, type of surgery, depression, Framingham risk score, and preoperative blood pressure. Delirium was diagnosed with the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM), and the Delirium Rating Scale-R-98 (DRS) was used to assess symptom severity. LASSO and Best Subsets logistic and linear regression were employed in line with TRIPOD guidelines. Results: Three participants were excluded due to intraoperative deaths (2) and alcohol withdrawal (1). Ninety-seven participants with a mean age of 71.68+4.55, 55% male (31/97 CAM+, 32%) and a mean Peak DRS of 21.5+6.40 were analyzed. Of the variables included, only NSQIP-SC and TMTB were identified to be predictors of postoperative delirium incidence (p<0.001, AUROC 0.81, 95% CI: 0.72, 0.90) and severity (p<0.001, Adj. R2: 0.30). Conclusions: In this cohort, preoperative NSQIP-SC and TMTB were identified as predictors of postoperative delirium incidence and severity. Future studies should verify whether this two- factor model could be used for accurate delirium prediction. Keywords: aging, delirium, perioperative, prediction, surgical risk.

Circulating MicroRNAs in Delayed Cerebral Infarction After Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage,"BACKGROUND
Delayed cerebral infarction (DCI) is a major cause of morbidities after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and typically starts at day 4 to 7 after initial hemorrhage. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in posttranscriptional gene expression control, and distinctive patterns of circulating miRNA changes have been identified for some diseases. We aimed to investigate miRNAs that characterize SAH patients with DCI compared with those without DCI.


METHODS AND RESULTS
Circulating miRNAs were collected on day 7 after SAH in healthy, SAH-free controls (n=20), SAH patients with DCI (n=20), and SAH patients without DCI (n=20). We used the LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) method of regression analysis to characterize miRNAs associated with SAH patients with DCI compared with those without DCI. In the 28 dysregulated miRNAs associated with DCI and SAH, we found that a combination of 4 miRNAs (miR-4532, miR-4463, miR-1290, and miR-4793) could differentiate SAH patients with DCI from those without DCI with an area under the curve of 100% (95% CI 1.000-1.000, P<0.001). This 4-miRNA combination could also distinguish SAH patients with or without DCI from healthy controls with areas under the curve of 99.3% (95% CI 0.977-1.000, P<0.001) and 82.0% (95% CI 0.685-0.955, P<0.001), respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
We found a 4-miRNA combination that characterized SAH patients with DCI. The findings could guide futureÂ mechanistic study to develop therapeutic targets.",2017,Journal of the American Heart Association: Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Disease
Distribution and abundance of the goldstripe darter (Etheostoma parvipinne) in Missouri,"From 1997 to 1999, I surveyed for the goldstripe darter (Etheostoma parvipinne), an endangered species in Missouri, to describe its distribution and abundance at 3 scales. At the largest scale, I sampled all small, flowing streams on Crowley's Ridge and the Ozark fall-line in southeastern Missouri. I identified 5 spatially distinct communities by their unique species: the goldstripe darter community, the gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum) community, the orangethroat darter (Etheostoma spectabile)-central stoneroller (Campostoma anomalum) community, the banded pygmy sunfish (Elassoma zonatum) community, and the blacktail shiner (Cyprinella venusta)-blunt-nose minnow (Pimephales notatus) community. Despite exhaustive sampling, I did not find goldstripe darters at Romine Spring, the 1 historic locality on the Ozark fall-line, nor anywhere else on the Ozark fall-line. I did find them in the 3 historically sampled streams in the Holly Ridge area on Crowley's Ridge, plus 3 previously unsampled streams in the immediate vicinity. At an intermediate scale, I failed to capture goldstripe darters in 12 of 18 streams in the Holly Ridge area. The streams without goldstripe darters were associated with human modifications such as gravel mining, small impoundments, household effluent, and pipe culverts. At the smallest scale, I collected 106 goldstripe darters at 15 sites on 6 streams. I estimated total length of habitat for goldstripe darters in Missouri to be 5.7 km of stream. I found that there were more goldstripe darters in a larger area than previously thought; however, goldstripe darters were still one of the rarest fish species in Missouri.",2002,Southwestern Naturalist
Limit analysis of continuous media with piecewise linear yeld condition,"SommarioSi affronta il problema dell'analisi limite dei mezzi continui costituiti di materiale rigido perfettamente plastico aventi superficie di snervamento di tipo poliedrico. Si definiscono in forma unitaria, avvalendosi di noti concetti di programmazione lineare, i principi di estremo riguardanti la valutazione della potenza specifica di dissipazione. Si deducono poi i principi fondamentali che governano il problema del collasso plastico attraverso una semplice formulazione basata sul ben noto teorema cinematico dell'analisi limite. Si suggerisce infine un procedimento approssimato tutt'affatto generale per la valutazione del carico di collasso di un qualsiasi mezzo continuo.SummaryThe problem of limit analysis of continua formed by rigid-perfectly plastic material with piecewise yield surface is discussed. With the use of the known concepts of linear programming, the extremum principles concerning the determination of specific dissipation power are defined in unitary form. The basic principles governing the problem of plastic collapse are then expressed through a simple formulation based on the well known kinematical theorem of limit analysis. Finally, an approximate general procedure is suggested for the calculation of the collapse load of continuous media.",1971,Meccanica
"Performance limits of stochastic sub-gradient learning, Part I: Single agent case","In this work and the supporting Part II, we examine the performance of stochastic sub-gradient learning strategies under weaker conditions than usually considered in the literature. The new conditions are shown to be automatically satisfied by several important cases of interest including SVM, LASSO, and Total-Variation denoising formulations. In comparison, these problems do not satisfy the traditional assumptions used in prior analyses and, therefore, conclusions derived from these earlier treatments are not directly applicable to these problems. The results in this article establish that stochastic sub-gradient strategies can attain linear convergence rates, as opposed to sub-linear rates, to the steady-state regime. A realizable exponential-weighting procedure is employed to smooth the intermediate iterates and guarantee useful performance bounds in terms of convergence rate and excessive risk performance. Part I of this work focuses on single-agent scenarios, which are common in stand-alone learning applications, while Part II extends the analysis to networked learners. The theoretical conclusions are illustrated by several examples and simulations, including comparisons with the FISTA procedure.",2018,Signal Process.
"Tabaquisme i esport. Modificacions metabÃ²liques, cardiopulmonars i subjectives durant l'exercici fÃ­sic","Introduccio: La nicotina causa una estimulacio simpatica per mitja de mecanismes centrals i periferics. Els mecanismes mediats pel SNC inclouen lactivacio dels quimioreceptors periferics, particularment els quimioreceptors carotidis i dels cossos aortics, i efectes directes sobre el tronc de lencefal i la medulla espinal. Aquesta resposta simpaticomimetica a la nicotina, amb lactivacio dels quimioreceptors, produeix per via reflexa vasoconstriccio, taquicardia i elevacio de la pressio arterial. Els mecanismes periferics inclouen lalliberament de catecolamines des de la medulla suprarenal i les terminacions nervioses vasculars. Aquesta descarrega adrenergica que sinicia amb el fumar pot afectar la resposta de lorganisme durant lesforc.
Objectiu: La finalitat de lestudi es la de coneixer les respostes fisiologiques i subjectives en el curs de lexercici fisic fins a lextenuacio, en els individus en funcio del seu habit tabaquic i, si existeixen diferencies entre els mateixos fumadors actius i en situacio dabstinencia tabaquica.
Material i metode: Shan estudiat 38 subjectes dedats compreses entre 18 i 48 anys (mitjana de 32,7). La distribucio en funcio de lhabit tabaquic ha estat: 25 fumadors (F)(17 homes i 8 dones)i 13 no fumadors (NF)(8 homes i 5 dones). Lestudi ha constat de dues parts: 1a. Comparacio del comportament dels F i NF al llarg duna prova desforc (PE) amb analisi dels gasos espirats mitjancant cicloergometre. La temperatura cutania (TC) sha registrat de forma continua i simultania amb dos sensors termics, un a la regio dorsal i laltre a la cuixa, sobre el quadriceps.

Labstinencia tabaquica sha detectat i confirmat mitjancant la determinacio dels nivells de COHb en sang venosa abans de la PE.
Resultats i conclusions: En el nostre estudi, hem comprovat que lhabit tabaquic, com a efecte cronic, no modifica de forma significativa la capacitat maxima de treball durant lesforc en els individus sans i amb edats compreses entre els 18 i 48 anys, independentment del genere i del grau dactivitat fisica. Pero encara que el consum de cigarretes en individus acostumats a fumar no restringeix significativament el seu rendiment fisic, si que es modifica, de forma notable, la seva resposta fisiologica durant lactivitat fisica de lleugera i moderada intensitat. Aquesta es manifesta amb un increment significatiu en la despesa metabolica i loxidacio dhidrats de carboni com a substrat energetic, un increment en la resposta cardiocirculatoria i pulmonar (en menor grau), i una deficient resposta termoreguladora al llarg de lesforc. El fumar cigarretes, al ritme habitual i sense evitar el seu consum les hores previes a lactivitat fisica, pot afectar de forma significativa els mecanismes implicats en la termoregulacio i provocar una resposta hemodinamica alterada durant lexercici. Lassociacio de tabac i activitat fisica dalta intensitat pot fer augmentar la temperatura central al pertorbar els mecanismes de perdua de calor mitjancant la redistribucio del flux vascular cutani. A mes, durant exercicis perllongats com els exercicis de resistencia, i en ambients calorosos, el consum de cigarretes pot actuar com a factor limitant en el rendiment esportiu, i incrementar el risc dhipertermia. En canvi, el consum de tabac disminueix de forma significativa la percepcio de lesforc durant lactivitat fisica dalta intensitat en els fumadors actius.",2002,
Bayesian reassessment of the epigenetic architecture of complex traits,"Epigenetic DNA modification is partly under genetic control, and occurs in response to a wide range of environmental exposures. Linking epigenetic marks to clinical outcomes may provide greater insight into underlying molecular processes of disease, assist in the identification of therapeutic targets, and improve risk prediction. Here, we present a statistical approach, based on Bayesian inference, that estimates associations between disease risk and all measured epigenetic probes jointly, automatically controlling for both data structure (including cell-count effects, relatedness, and experimental batch effects) and correlations among probes. We benchmark our approach in simulation study, finding improved estimation of probe associations across a wide range of scenarios over existing approaches. Our method estimates the total proportion of disease risk captured by epigenetic probe variation, and when we applied it to measures of body mass index (BMI) and cigarette consumption behaviour in 5,101 individuals, we find that 66.7% (95% CI 60.0-72.8) of the variation in BMI and 67.7% (95% CI 58.4-76.9) of the variation in cigarette consumption can be captured by methylation array data from whole blood, independent of the variation explained by single nucleotide polymorphism markers. We find novel associations, with smoking behaviour associated with a methylation probe at the MNDA gene with >95% posterior inclusion probability, which is a myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen gene previously implicated as a biomarker for inflammation and non-Hodgkin lymphoma risk. We conduct unique genome-wide enrichment analyses, identifying blood cholesterol, lipid transport and sterol metabolism pathways for BMI, and response to xenobiotic stimulus and negative regulation of RNA polymerase II promoter transcription for smoking, all with >95% posterior inclusion probability of having methylation probes with associations >1.5 times larger than the average. Finally, we improve phenotypic prediction in two independent cohorts by 28.7% and 10.2% for BMI and smoking respectively over a LASSO model. These results imply that probe measures may capture large amounts of variance because they are likely a consequence of the phenotype rather than a cause. As a result, â€˜omicsâ€™ data may enable accurate characterization of disease progression and identification of individuals who are on a path to disease. Our approach facilitates better understanding of the underlying epigenetic architecture of complex common disease and is applicable to any kind of genomics data.",2018,bioRxiv
On the Consistency of Feature Selection using Greedy Least Squares Regression,"This paper studies the feature selection problem using a greedy least squares regression algorithm. We show that under a certain irrepresentable condition on the design matrix (but independent of the sparse target), the greedy algorithm can select features consistently when the sample size approaches infinity. The condition is identical to a corresponding condition for Lasso. 
 
Moreover, under a sparse eigenvalue condition, the greedy algorithm can reliably identify features as long as each nonzero coefficient is larger than a constant times the noise level. In comparison, Lasso may require the coefficients to be larger than O(âˆšs) times the noise level in the worst case, where s is the number of nonzero coefficients.",2009,J. Mach. Learn. Res.

Anthropogenic impact on past and present fire regimes in a boreal forest landscape of southeastern Norway,"Fire-scarred wood samples from 50 stumps, snags, and living trees of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) were dendrochronologically cross-dated to describe an 800 year long fire history of Eldferdalen Nature Reserve (~6 ha) and its surroundings (~4000 ha) in southeastern Norway. In the western part of the study area, we recorded 55 different fires within a 200 ha area around the reserve between 1511 and 1759 and a mean fire interval in single samples of 24.6 years. The composite mean fire interval for the nature reserve was 10.5 years. Fire intervals were longer in the eastern part of the study area, with a single sample mean fire interval of 49.1 years. Only three fires were detected af- ter 1759, the last one in 1822. Based on historical accounts, we assume that the high number of fires and short fire in- tervals were influenced by deliberate ignition for agricultural purposes, most likely burning to improve the conditions for cattle grazing and slash-and-burn cultivation. We suggest that the cessation of fires was influenced by the increased value of timber and mining activity, thereby leading to increased interest in conservation of the timber resources. Resume : Des echantillons de bois portant des cicatrices de feu et provenant de 50 souches, chicots et tiges vivantes de pin sylvestre (Pinus sylvestris L.) ont ete dates par recoupement a l'aide de la dendrochronologie pour reconstituer l'historique des incendies sur une periode de 800 ans dans la reserve naturelle Eldferdalen (~6 ha) et aux alentours (~4000 ha) dans le sud-est de la Norvege. Dans la partie ouest de l'aire d'etude, les auteurs ont identifie 55 incendies differents a l'interieur d'une zone de 200 ha autour de la reserve entre 1511 et 1759 et un intervalle moyen entre les incendies dans les echantillons uniques de 24,6 annees.

Son preference and contraceptive practice among tribal groups in rural South India,"This paper examines the son preference and contraceptive practice among tribal groups in rural south India. Parentsâ€™ preferences for the sex of their children have constituted an important theme in population and social research over the past three decades. Data were collected from a household survey of 398 currently married women of reproductive age group (15-49) from four taluks in the Nilgiris District of rural Tamilnadu are selected with respect to the different tribal communities. Cross tabulation and logistic regression analysis was carried out for finding out relationships between the socio-economic, demographic variables on contraceptive practice. The use of contraceptive practice by tribal groups in rural areas is strongly linked to individual and household socio-economic and demographic variables. Findings shows that the expectation that a son will provide financial support in old age is strongly associated with the response that a son is important. Son preference is slightly more among the tribal women, particularly among the users of spacing method who are more among those preferring the sons. Some of the socio-economic variables like education of husband and occupation have shown negative influence on higher fertility and positive influence on contraceptive use among the tribal women. It is proposed that there is need for more comprehensive on tribes in different areas in state and in the Indian nation to explicitly bring out the son preference attitudes of tribal people, which have an impact on their fertility and family planning practices. A. SATHIYA SUSUMAN 32 pucca houses to them as early as possible. As the social participation is low, suitable steps should be taken to increase their participation in public bodies and institutions (Gurusamy, 1988). Fertility differentials, child mortality and family planning practices between two tribal groups in Luknow, India, a majority of the tribal groups 87 per cent and 67 per cent were living in joint family units; two-third of the tribal women were without schooling and the extent of indebtedness was high among both groups. Lower mean age at marriage among the wives of the two groups. Lower mean age at first birth, an average women gave a higher fertility level children and a higher ideal family size (Saxena, 1982). The acceptance and practice of family planning by the eligible couples depends to a very large extent on their awareness and knowledge regarding family planning methods, availability of services and favorable attitude towards family planning practices (Gurumurthy, 1986; Karkal Pause, 1979; Nag, 1991). The validity of the concept those tribes had a higher birth rate than the general population and the socio-cultural factors were responsible for the higher fertility among tribes. Two indicators of sex preference were used in the study such as the ideal number of sons and ideal number of daughters in a family. More balanced view concerning the ideal number of sons and daughters among the tribal women. The women do not have any special preference for either boys or girls (Repetto, 1972). The tribal society does not suffer from the compulsion to get married and have children, preferably a son. The tribal neither believe in rebirth nor believe in the theory of transmigration of soul. A number of studies in India showed that parents like to depend on their sons for old age security than their daughters. The cost of bringing up children up to age 15 does not seem to vary much between sons and daughters. However, the expectations from sons appeared to be more as compared to the daughters. The review of related literature leads us to conclude that the theoretical explanations advanced for some expected relationship between level of development socio-economic and cultural and value of children are sound . But the empirical relationship obtained in various setting always does not support the expected relationships. It is more so in the case of individual characteristics of the parents and value of children. The differentials in the (fertility differentials) level are due to differentials in the value of sons and daughters child, which are likely to be different under Indian context (Kuriyan, 1982; Sarma et al., 1974). Both the boys and girls were perceived as contributing rather differently to these basic values. Respondents of both sexes perceived boys contribute to the satisfaction of a greater number of values and needs than girls. Financial security, being accepted by others, having a happy home, personal achievement and carrying on the family name were all values that respondents associated more with boys than with girls (Sathiya Susuman, 2000). The patterns observed, however, are by no means uniform throughout India and they can be expected to continue to decline. The preference for sons that has been observed to varying degrees in every part of India has been showed to have an adverse effect on both fertility behavior and sex differentials in child mortality (Krishnamoorthy, 1974). The desire for sons discourages some couples from discontinuing childbearing after reaching their desired number of children because they have not yet had their minimum desired number of sons (Vlassoff et al., 1980). Tribal communities of various countries and societies are using contraception for limit their family size. While the same, couples has been desired more number of children, irrespective of the sex. Most of the tribal couples want at least on son for various reasons. This might be traditional or cultural system. When couples have achieved desired number of sex particularly sons, they adopt sterilization from government hospital or health centre or other temporary methods or usually tribal women are using herbal medicine or home made contraception (Sathiya Susuman, 2000). It is necessary to study the son preference and contraceptive practice among rural south Indian tribal groups. The major aim of the study is to examine the son preference and contraceptive practice among various groups of tribal communities, it is important that we consider with under developed community groups. To this study, the tribal women were compared with respect to their influence of socio-economic and demographic variables on son preference and contraceptive practice in rural areas.",2006,
"Cytogenetic effects of agricultural chemicals. II. Effects of herbicides ""lasso and basagran"" on chromosomal mechanism in relation to yield and yield components in chilli (capsicum annuum L.)","The present investigation was undertaken to study the undesirable effects of the herbicides, namely, lasso and basagran at higher dose levels on chilli crop. It was observed that both germination and survival were effected in all the treatments of lasso and basagran and the injurious effects of lasso on germination and survival was more than in basagran. Similarly, both lasso and basagran treatments produced meiotic aberrations and the frequency is markedly higher in lasso treatments than in basagran. Pollen sterility which was observed from 17th to 23rd day after spray was highest in lasso treatments over basagran. Yield and yield components are on a par with control in basagran treated population, while it was significantly reduced in lasso treatments. It was concluded that in herbicides like lasso, the threshold level should be fixed for more safer use.",1981,Cytologia
Edge detection in sparse Gaussian graphical models,"In this paper, we consider the problem of detecting edges in a Gaussian graphical model. The problem is equivalent to the identification of non-zero entries of the concentration matrix of a normally distributed random vector. Following the methodology initiated in Meinshausen and Buhlmann (2006), we tackle the problem through regression models where each component of the random vector is regressed on the remaining components. We adapt a method called SLasso cum EBIC (sequential LASSO cum extended Bayesian information criterion) recently developed in Luo and Chen (2011) for feature selection in sparse regression models to suit the special nature of the concentration matrix, and propose two approaches, dubbed SR-SLasso and JR-SLasso, for the identification of non-zero entries of the concentration matrix. Comprehensive numerical studies are conducted to compare the proposed approaches with other available competing methods. The numerical studies demonstrate that the proposed approaches are more accurate than the other methods for the identification of non-zero entries of the concentration matrix.",2014,Comput. Stat.

Probabilistic forecasting of day-ahead solar irradiance using quantile gradient boosting,"Abstract Due to the chaotic nature of the underlying physical processes, even state-of-the-art models cannot perfectly forecast the solar irradiance at the surface of the earth. There is, therefore, a growing interest in the research community for forecasting methods that can quantify their own uncertainty. This paper proposes a novel probabilistic framework for forecasting day-ahead hourly solar irradiance. A principal component analysis (PCA) is used to tightly combine a high-resolution mesoscale numerical weather prediction (NWP) model with a quantile gradient boosting algorithm. A thorough evaluation of the deterministic and probabilistic properties of the model is conducted for a full year in the tropical island of Singapore. The impact of the sky conditions on its performance is also considered. Furthermore, a rigorous statistical framework is employed to systematically benchmark our model against two state of the art methods, a Lasso model output statistic procedure and an analog ensemble (AnEn). Our model significantly improves the numerical weather prediction model: it achieves a 41% reduction of the MAE and 39% reduction of the RMSE. It is also slightly more accurate than Lasso and has a CRPS 4% lower than that of AnEn.",2018,Solar Energy
"The Influence Of Maternal Nutrition Intake On The Birth Weight Of Newborns In Lanzhou, China","Background: The objective of this paper is to evaluate the role of maternal nutrition intake before and during pregnancy on infant birth weight. Self-reported data on intake of 94 nutrients during four time periods (one year before pregnancy and during the three trimesters of pregnancy) was collected from over 7,000 women during 2010-2012 in Gansu Provincial Maternity and Child Care Hospital in Lanzhou, China. Methods: Hierarchical clustering and k-means clustering were performed to detect any potentially influential nutrients. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the dimension of predictors and linear regression analysis was subsequently conducted to fit new nutrient components and confounders on birth weight. Since the Globaltest showed significant influence of nutrient intake in participant group with low prepregnancy maternal Body Mass Index (BMI), stepwise selection and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Lasso) methods were then performed directly over the 94 nutrients in low BMI group. Results: Hierarchical clustering and k-means clustering both resulted in six clusters, but the averages of birth weight in the six clusters were not significantly different from each other based on ANOVA result (p-value=0.1229 and 0.1032, for hierarchical and k-means clustering, respectively). Principal Components Analysis (PCA) was then performed and selected 10 new nutrient components to represent the original 94 nutrients. The following step was to fit the 10 new components and 9 confounders on birth weight in a linear regression model. This procedure was repeated for the four time periods. For each time period, there were two components showing strong association with birth weight. Comparing to the base model with only confounders, full models with nutrient components had very small R-squared increase (around 0.01). According to the Globaltest result, the overall effect of 94 nutrients showed strong association with birth weight in low pre-pregnancy maternal BMI group in all four time periods (pvalues=0.0439, 0.0033, 0.0017, and 0.0024, for four time periods, respectively). In the model selection part, stepwise selection resulted in two significant nutrient variables out of 94 variables for each time period. Specifically, variable â€˜insoluble dietary fiberâ€™ showed strong association with birth weight (p-value=0.0022, 0.0051 and 0.0062, for pre-pregnancy, the 2 and 3 trimester, respectively). In addition, a few vitamin nutrients showed strong association with birth weight (p-values < 0.0001), but the estimated coefficients were very small. Lasso method showed similar results as stepwise selection. Few nutrients showed significant influence but with very small estimated coefficients, and R-squared of the full models had very small increase compared to the base model with only confounders. Conclusions: Several methods have been tried to test the association between maternal nutrition intake and birth weight of newborns, such as clustering on predictors and observations, Globaltest, stepwise selection and Lasso method in linear regression. These methods showed consistent results that overall maternal nutrition intake was significantly associated with infant birth weight in low maternal BMI group, and a few individual nutrients showed significant association. It is suggested that instead of focusing on altered consumption of individual nutrients, overall maternal nutrition intake should be improved to help control birth weight in the normal range.",2013,
Handling Sparsity via the Horseshoe,"This paper presents a general, fully Bayesian framework for sparse supervised-learning problems based on the horseshoe prior. The horseshoe prior is a member of the family of multivariate scale mixtures of normals, and is therefore closely related to widely used approaches for sparse Bayesian learning, including, among others, Laplacian priors (e.g. the LASSO) and Student-t priors (e.g. the relevance vector machine). The advantages of the horseshoe are its robustness at handling unknown sparsity and large outlying signals. These properties are justied theoretically via a representation theorem and accompanied by comprehensive empirical experiments that compare its performance to benchmark alternatives.",2009,
Epidemiologic Profile of Accidents Involving Thalassophryne nattereri in Alagoas,"Accidents caused by aquatic venomous animalâ€™s present lower occurrence than those involving terrestrial ones due to their habitat and especially to underreporting. Among the animals which cause these accidents, the Thalassophryne nattereri fish is emphasized in the northwestern coast of Brazil, especially in the state of Alagoas. With its particular venom inoculation apparatus, two dorsal and two lateral canaliculated spines, this envenoming causes pain, fever, severe local inflammatory reaction, formation of erythema and swelling, often are evolving to necrosis. The treatment received is limited to the administration of anti-inflammatory and antibiotic medications, with the latter in order to prevent a secondary bacterial infection. Many of the injured do not seek medical attention and end up using home remedies. In this context, we carried out a survey to quantify the occurrence of this type of accidents in two fishing communities belonging to the Mundau lagoon, located in the state of Alagoas, Brazil, by applying questionnaires and collecting data through patient records along with the Secretariat of Health of the State of Alagoas. The results obtained indicate the most common group of injured persons: men at working age who use fishing as mean of survival and have especially their feet and hands injured in this type of accident. It is possible to conclude that these accidents caused by Thalassophryne nattereri occur with high frequency during fishing activities in the state of Alagoas. The envenoming drives the fishermen away from their work and leads to other complications to the life and health of the injured, as well as to their economic activity. This type of study makes this sort of accident noticeable for the society, such approach has never been conducted in the state of Alagoas and we believe that it might stimulate the interest in deepen the knowledge on toxins, the development of more efficient medical treatments and accident prevention.",2018,Journal of Clinical Toxicology
Additive Models with Sparse Convexity Patterns,"In nonparametric statistics, additive modeling is an efficient and interpretable technique for multivariate models, even when the true model is not additive. Shape constraints, such as requiring functions to be convex or monotone, also allow tractable methods that apply to numerous examples. Here, we propose a novel estimation technique that combines additive models with shape constraints. Specifically, we consider a regression model in which the true function is additive and each component is either convex, concave, or identically zero. This model extends the idea of sparse additive models (SpAM) proposed in [17]. We first show that the problem can be expressed as a 0-1 mixed-integer secondorder cone program (MISOCP), for which there exist solvers based on heuristics. Then, we describe our recently discovered quadratic program (QP) formulation which extends the idea of Lasso [20]. We present examples as well as simulations comparing the different formulations. âˆ—This work is done as part of the Chicago Center for the Theory of Computing and Allied Areas (â€œTheory Centerâ€) Summer 2014 Research Education for Undergraduates (REU) Program, which is jointly run by the University of Chicago and Toyota Technical Institute at Chicago.

"Lista de peces costeros del Parque Nacional Marino Ballena, Costa Rica, con anotaciones sobre su ecologÃ­a","Using gill nets during 1999 and two types of underwater fish counts in 2002, 2004 and 2005, we characterized the demersal, pelagic and coral reef fish assemblages inhabiting Parque Nacional Marino Ballena, located in the South Pacific coast of Costa Rica. In total, 79 species were recorded, 21 of those were collected with gill nets, 54 were observed during the fish counts and four where observed in both. Scomberomorus sierra, Peprilus medius, Cynoscion reticulatus and Caranx caninus were the most abundant gill net species representative of demersal and pelagic fauna, while Thalassoma lucasanum, Stegastes acapulcoensis and Stegastes flavilatus were more abundant during the visual surveys and representative of coral reef fish fauna. An analysis of the reef fish fauna suggests that La Viuda is the site with more diversity while Tombolo Sur holds more evenness. A clustering analysis suggests that the fish community composition is related to the reef habitat. Regarding pelagic and demersal species, we found that the size distribution of the most common species were skewed towards medium to small sizes, therefore it would be interesting to investigate whether PNMB is an important site for juvenile and sub-adult stages, or if historical fishing accounts for the small sizes found. We encourage future, more detailed research in the park, since more extended baseline data is needed to manage this fishing and tourist area.",2008,

LASSO-Driven Inference in Time and Space,"We consider the estimation and inference in a system of high-dimensional regression equations allowing for temporal and cross-sectional dependency in covariates and error processes, covering rather general forms of weak dependence. A sequence of large-scale regressions with LASSO is applied to reduce the dimensionality, and an overall penalty level is carefully chosen by a block multiplier bootstrap procedure to account for multiplicity of the equations and dependencies in the data. Correspondingly, oracle properties with a jointly selected tuning parameter are derived. We further provide high-quality de-biased simultaneous inference on the many target parameters of the system. We provide bootstrap consistency results of the test procedure, which are based on a general Bahadur representation for the Z-estimators with dependent data. Simulations demonstrate good performance of the proposed inference procedure. Finally, we apply the method to quantify spillover effects of textual sentiment indices in a financial market and to test the connectedness among sectors.

Requirements and Infrastructure for the Modelling of Electronic Market Transactions,"The emphasis of commercial usage of the Web has shifted from marketing-related communication goals to conducting business transactions on-line. While the technical implementation of electronic transactions at firm-level has become readily available, the management of on-line distribution infrastructures and of industry-level standards and integration is still lacking attention and solutions. This paper attempts to point out the current deficiencies based on Schmidâ€™s Reference Model of Electronic Market transactions (1993; Schmid & Lindemann, 1998). The ultimate goal behind this research is to provide a commercial modelling environment for on-line vendors and information brokers that enables them to optimise their operations and gain competitive advantage. The proposed research aims at resolving these deficiencies by introducing industry-wide specifications for all phases of Electronic Market transactions and by providing modelling methods and tools to allow individual organisations to plan and optimise their Electronic Commerce Strategies. Introduction The Nature of Electronic Markets The concept of â€œElectronic Marketsâ€ was first published in the scientific community by Malone, Yates and Benjamin (Malone, Yates, & Benjamin, 1987; Malone, Yates, & Benjamin, 1989). While the term was introduced as a contrast to â€œElectronic Hierarchiesâ€ based on the classical transaction cost theory (Coase, 1937; Williamson, 1981), numerous authors extended the concept and applied to it to various market scenarios and corporate applications (compare, for example, Bakos, 1991; Benjamin & Wigand, 1995; Brandtweiner & Scharl, 1998b; Kalakota & Whinston, 1996, 219ff.; Rayport & Sviokla, 1994; Zwass, 1996). It does not come as a surprise that these varying objectives and application areas led to some extent to differing definitions of attributes and characteristics of Electronic Markets. In this paper the term Electronic Markets refers to a â€œsystem of many-to-many (buyer-to-supplier) relations established through on-line connections with increasing participation numbersâ€ (Bauer & Glasson, 1999). A more detailed discussion of the attributes of Electronic Markets can be found in Bauer and Chong (1999). While the theoretical foundations and predictions of potential impacts are fairly well researched, business practice and concrete infrastructure and content management are lagging behind. The financial success appears limited so far and the functionality of actual implementations remains relatively simple (compared to technical feasibility and user assistance requirements). Electronic Market coordination and allocation mechanisms may be radically different from traditional market models (compare Timmers, 1998), leading to unusual, sometimes innovative suggestions, like electronic auctions (see, for example, Kambil & van Heck, 1998; Klein, 1997), multiattribute negotiations (Bichler, 1999; Bichler & Segev, 1998) or even the â€œVirtual Electronic Bazaarâ€ (Brandtweiner & Scharl, 1998a). Proposals for the technical infrastructure also cover a broad range of in terms of complexity and design effort, from the initial stages of loosely coupled â€œElectronic Mallsâ€ (Schmid et al., 1995) to sophisticated agent-based market environments [compare, for example, MITâ€™s â€œKasbahâ€ http://ecommerce.media.mit.edu/ Kasbah/ as described by Chavez and Maes (1996) and â€œMarket Makerâ€ http://maker.media.mit.edu/). More guidance about the development architecture and process elements is provided by the Reference Model of Electronic Markets as proposed by Schmid (1993; Schmid & Lindemann, 1998). Bauer (1998) presents the following definition of reference models: â€œReference Models are aiming at providing guidance and instructions for developing other systems. It is important to note the â€˜reference characterâ€™. [...] The main purpose of Reference Models is to cater for pre-built components and to stimulate ideas. [...] Reference Models represent a generalisation.â€ In this particular instance, Schmid aims to provide a framework for the design and analysis of Electronic Market systems. The Reference Model for Electronic Markets has already been specified in more detail (see. for example, Lindemann & Runge, 1998) and has served as the basis for further extensions (compare, for example, Suter, 1999; Suter, Kaempfen, & Probst, 1998). It breaks down individual Electronic Market transactions into three sequential phases and four so-called â€œviewsâ€. These resemble â€œlayeredâ€ perspectives, similar to the ISO/OSI (International Standardization Organization/Open Standards Implementation) reference model of networking technology (Tanenbaum, 1989) or some Electronic Commerce models (compare, for example, Bauer & Glasson, 1999; Kalakota & Whinston, 1996, pp. 3ff.; Zwass, 1996). Figure 1 provides an overview of the Reference Model for Electronic Markets. Rather than providing a more detailed description of this concept, we refer the reader to Schmid (1993; Schmid & Lindemann, 1998).",1999,
"Influence of oil, dispersant, and pressure on microbial communities from the Gulf of Mexico","The Deepwater Horizon incident in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 released an unprecedented amount of petroleum hydrocarbons 1500 meters below the sea surface. Few studies have considered the influence of hydrostatic pressure on bacterial community development and activity during such spills. The goal of this study was to investigate the response of indigenous sediment microbial communities to the combination of increased pressure, hydrocarbons and dispersant. Deep-sea sediment samples collected from the northern Gulf of Mexico were incubated at atmospheric pressure (0.1â€‰MPa) and at elevated pressure (10â€‰MPa), with and without the addition of crude oil and dispersant. After incubations at 4â€‰Â°C for 7 days, Colwellia and Psychrobium were highly abundant in all samples. Pressure differentially impacted members of the Alteromonadales. The influences of pressure on the composition of bacterial communities were most pronounced when dispersant was added to the incubations. Moritella and Thalassotalea were greatly stimulated by the addition of dispersant, suggesting their roles in dispersant biodegradation. However, Moritella was negatively impacted by increasing pressure. The presence of dispersant was shown to decrease the relative abundance of a known hydrocarbon degrader, Cycloclasticus, while increasing pressure increased its relative abundance. This study highlights the significant influence of pressure on the development of microbial communities in the presence of oil and dispersant during oil spills and related response strategies in the deep sea.",2020,Scientific Reports
"Thalassobaculum litoreum gen. nov., sp. nov., a member of the family Rhodospirillaceae isolated from coastal seawater.","A Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic strain with slightly curved and straight rod-shaped cells, strain CL-GR58(T), was isolated from coastal seawater (near Gori, Korea). Analyses of the 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed that strain CL-GR58(T) belonged to the family Rhodospirillaceae with Azospirillum lipoferum as its closest relative (gene sequence similarity of 90.9 %). Phylogenetic analyses of the 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain CL-GR58(T) was not associated with any known genera in the family Rhodospirillaceae. The novel strain grew in the presence of 1-10 % sea salts, optimally at 30-35 degrees C and pH 8. The major cellular fatty acids consisted of C(18 : 1)omega7c (48.5 %), C(16 : 0) (14.8 %), C(17 : 0) (12.2 %), C(19 : 0) cyclo omega8c (6.3 %) and summed feature 3 (C(16 : 1)omega7c and/or iso-C(15 : 0) 2-OH, 6.0 %). Among the phylogenetically related genera, the fatty acid C(17 : 0) was found only in strain CL-GR58(T). The DNA G+C content of the novel strain was 68.0 mol%. According to phylogenetic analyses of the 16S rRNA gene sequence, fatty acid content and the physiological data, strain CL-GR58(T) represents a novel species in a new genus of the family Rhodospirillaceae, for which the name Thalassobaculum litoreum gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of the type species is CL-GR58(T) (=KCCM 42674(T)=DSM 18839(T)).",2008,International journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology
"Response to Niklasson's comment on Lin, et al. (2012) : ""the relation between postural movement and bilateral motor integration"".","In the study of Lin, Wu, Lin, Wu, Wu, Kuo, and Yeung (2012 ), the relationship between the validity of postural movement and bilateral motor integration in terms of sensory integration theory was examined. Postural movement is the ability to use the antigravity postures required for stabilization of the neck, trunk and upper extremities via muscle co-contractions in the neck and upper extremities, and balance. Niklasson's (2013 ) comment argued that postural movement should include primitive reflexes in terms of the general abilities approach. Niklasson (2013 ) focused on the efficacy of the treatment rather than the theoretical frameworks implied in the therapeutic activities. For that purpose Lin, et al. (2012 ) used sensory integration as the theoretical foundation, and the relationship between postural movement and bilateral motor integration was assessed via empirical data. The result of Lin, et al. (2012 ) was offered as a theoretical reference for therapeutic activities.",2014,Perceptual and motor skills
InvestigaciÃ³n e IntervenciÃ³n en Violencia contra la Mujer en las Relaciones de Pareja,"Universidad de ValenciaLa violencia contra la mujer en las relaciones depareja es un problema social que afecta a miles demujeres en todo el mundo. Sin embargo, el â€œdescubri-mientoâ€ de la violencia de genero como problemasocial es un hecho relativamente reciente (Gracia,2002). Hay que esperar mas de 20 anos desde que seinicia el interes cientifico por este fenomeno para quesea considerado un problema de salud publica de pri-mer orden por organizaciones internacionales y gobier-nos, asi como un abuso de los derechos humanos, conuna elevada prevalencia en todo el mundo (AmericanMedical Association, 1994; Bachman y Saltzman,1995; Consejo Europeo, 2002; Hagemann-White, 2001;Kury, Obergfell-Fuchs y Woessner, 2003; Organi-zacion Mundial de la Salud, 2002). Es en 1995 cuandola Organizacion de Naciones Unidas plantea como unode sus objetivos prioritarios la lucha contra la violen-cia dirigida a las mujeres y en 1998 la OrganizacionMundial de la Salud declara la violencia de generocomo una prioridad internacional para los servicios desalud. Es en este mismo ano cuando, en nuestro pais,se elabora el primer â€œPlan de accion contra laViolencia Domesticaâ€ en el que se reconoce de formaexplicita la violencia de genero como un problema deestado (Fernandez et al., 2003). Hoy en dia, la preva-lencia de la violencia de genero en todo el mundo, suimpacto a corto y largo plazo en la salud mental y fisi-ca de las mujeres y las consecuencias negativas quetiene para las familias, las comunidades y la sociedaden general, convierten a la violencia de genero en unaprioridad de salud publica(Gracia y Herrero, 2006;Gracia y Lila, 2008; Klein et al., 1997; OrganizacionMundial de la Salud, 2002). En este sentido, los datos de diversos estudios yencuestas indican una elevada prevalencia de la violen-cia contra la mujer en las relaciones intimas. Asi, en elinforme de la Organizacion Mundial de la Salud,â€œWorld Report on Violence and Healthâ€, se recogendatos de 48 encuestas de distintos lugares del mundo,segun los cuales entre el 10% y el 69% de las mujeresindica haber sido maltratada fisicamente por un com-panero intimo en algun momento de su vida(Organizacion Mundial de la Salud, 2002). Igual-mente, un informe para Unicef sobre violencia domes-tica elaborado por el Innocenti Research Centre (2000)que recoge datos de 23 paises sobre la violencia quesufren las mujeres, estima que entre el 20% y el 50%de las mujeres, segun paises, sufren algun tipo de mal-trato en el seno de la familia. Este informe, que recogeestudios realizados con diversas metodologias en pai-ses de todos los continentes, tambien situa el porcenta -je de mujeres maltratadas en los paises industrializadosentre el 20% y el 30%, a excepcion de Japon que alcan-za el 59%. La dimension global de la violencia contrala mujer hace que ninguna sociedad pueda reclamarpara si el privilegio de estar libre de esa violencia. Porponer algunos ejemplos concretos, en Estados Unidosla Asociacion Medica Americana (American MedicalAssociation, 1994) estima que cerca del 25% de lasmujeres es victima de maltrato domestico al menos unavez en su vida, una tasa de incidencia que llevo aEverett Koop a denunciar que la violencia domesticacausa mas danos a las mujeres que la combinacion delos accidentes de automovil, asaltos y violaciones(Koop, 1989). Datos del Departamento de Justicia deEEUU indican que en este pais un millon de mujeres(una tasa equivalente a nueve mujeres de cada mil) sonvictimas de la violencia ejercida por personas con lasque mantienen una relacion intima. Sorprende en estaestadistica que la violencia que sufren las mujeres amanos de desconocidos (una tasa del 7,4 por mil) seamenor que la ejercida por personas con las que se man-tiene una relacion intima (Gelles, 1999). En Europa unanalisis de 10 estudios de prevalencia de la violenciadomestica llevado a cabo por el Consejo de Europaobtiene resultados consistentes: una de cada cuatromujeres experimentan la violencia domestica en algunmomento de su vida y entre el 6 y el 10% sufren malostratos anualmente (Consejo de Europa, 2002). En Espana disponemos de una macroencuesta quenos permite estimar los malos tratos que sufren lasmujeres en el ambito domestico (Instituto de la Mujer,2006). Esta macroencuesta de ambito nacional resultaademas particularmente interesante porque utiliza ladistincion entre maltrato declarado y maltrato tecnico.Es decir, se analiza la violencia contra la mujer tenien-do en cuenta no solo las mujeres que se autoclasificancomo maltratadas (maltrato declarado) sino tambien",2010,Psychosocial Intervention
Structure-Aware Dynamic Scheduler for Parallel Machine Learning,"Training large machine learning (ML) models with many variables or parameters can take a long time if one employs sequential procedures even with stochastic updates. A natural solution is to turn to distributed computing on a cluster; however, naive, unstructured parallelization of ML algorithms does not usually lead to a proportional speedup and can even result in divergence, because dependencies between model elements can attenuate the computational gains from parallelization and compromise correctness of inference. Recent efforts toward this issue have benefited from exploiting the static, a priori block structures residing in ML algorithms. In this paper, we take this path further by exploring the dynamic block structures and workloads therein present during ML program execution, which offers new opportunities for improving convergence, correctness, and load balancing in distributed ML. We propose and showcase a general-purpose scheduler, STRADS, for coordinating distributed updates in ML algorithms, which harnesses the aforementioned opportunities in a systematic way. We provide theoretical guarantees for our scheduler, and demonstrate its efficacy versus static block structures on Lasso and Matrix Factorization.",2013,ArXiv
"Predictive factors of immune tolerance treatment response in severe haemophilia A patients with inhibitors: A realâ€world report from a single centre, mixed retrospectiveâ€prospective longâ€term study","Dear Editor, The appropriate management of patients with inhibitors repâ€ resents the main challenge for physicians who specialize in haemoâ€ philia. Immune tolerance induction (ITI) is the primary therapeutic strategy for achieving inhibitor eradication.1 ITI represents an intenâ€ sive and continuous exposure to FVIII until a patient gains complete or partial tolerance against the factor. To contribute to the data from an experienced centre in managing haemophilic patients, the presâ€ ent mixed retrospective and prospective study was aimed to analyse the association between the ITI success rate with a series of cliniâ€ cal variables. The medical records of severe haemophilia A patients from a Congenital Coagulopathies Unit, who started an ITI regimen between March 1980 and July 2015, were reviewed. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice. Eligible subjects included both children and adults diagnosed with severe haemophilia A (FVIII:C <1%) and treated for primary or rescue ITI with plasmaâ€derived FVIII concentrates (pdFVIII), either purified FVIII or von Willebrand factor (VWF)â€containing (pdFVIII/ VWF), or with recombinant (rFVIII) concentrates. Rescue ITI was deâ€ fined as the ITI treatments undergone after failure of the primary ITI course. The definitions of ITI success and failure were generally consistent with those currently in use.1 The time to outcome was measured from initiation of ITI until achievement of success (comâ€ plete or partial), failure or rescue ITI. The decision of whether ITI was a failure, or to continue ITI treatment longer, was made according to the physician's discretion. For pharmacokinetic measurements, after 3 days of infused FVIII washing, FVIII:C levels were determined (â€œpreâ€). Then, 50 IU/kg FVIII was administered and FVIII:C was determined again after 15 minâ€ utes (â€œpostâ€), 1, 2, 6, 24 and 48 hours (although last 7 years, meaâ€ surements were taken at three time points: pre, post and 48 hours). For association analyses, a L1â€penalized logistic regression model, LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator), was used. Those variables not penalized to zero were considered as being associated with ITI success. Peak titre was logâ€transformed before the analyses because of its high right skewness. The use of penalized models is required in cases such as in this study, in which the number of variables was high in relation to the number of assessments. Kaplanâ€Meier survival analysis was constructed for the time elapsed in the percentage of patients: (a) reaching inhibitor elimiâ€ nation; (b) reaching a normal FVIII recovery and (c) reaching a normal halfâ€life of infused FVIII. Discrimination by infused FVIII dose (<100 IU/kg/d; â‰¥100 IU/kg/d) was also made. The generalâ€ ized Wilcoxon test was used for comparison. Software R (The R Foundation, Vienna, Austria) version 3.2.1 was used for calculations and analysis. Results showed that 26 patients started an ITI course during the study period. Of these, three patients are still under treatment while 23 ended primary ITI and were therefore evaluated. Data collected were retrospective in patients who started ITI up to year 2000 (n = 11) and prospective after that year (n = 12 patients). Details of patient characteristics and ITI data are shown in Table 1. Just over half of the patients (n = 13; 57%) started ITI within 1 year after inhibitor diagnostic (47% of complete success [CS]), while in nine patients (39%) the lapse took between 1 and 5 years, and one patient showed an extreme value of 11 years. Eighteen paâ€ tients (78%) were <5 years old at the time of ITI initiation (50% of CS). The majority of the patients (n = 18; 78%) showed an inhibitor titre <10 BU/mL at start of ITI (55% of CS) but five of them had titre â‰¥10 BU/mL (60% of CS). Overall, primary ITI success was 57% (13/23 patients), which was lower than that shown in previous studies ranging 63%â€100%.2â€7 A possible reason may be the inclusion of all screened patients in the study, thus mimicking a group with intention of treatment, which has shown a lower success rate. Similarly, preâ€ mature changes of product type or dose regimen in some patients as well as the high historical inhibitor peak titre in our population could have a role in reducing the chances of success. Nevertheless, less strict criteria than ours for reporting an outcome of successful ITI have been described in other studies6,8 and in a registry.9 The median time of ITI treatment was 11.4 months (Q1, Q3: 9, 24). Fourteen patients (61%) received pdFVIII (13 pdFVIII/VWF and 1 purified FVIII) for ITI. There was a higher rate of CS in patients treated with pdFVIII (10/14; 71%) rather than those treated with rFVIII (3/9; 33%). Interestingly, the percentage of patients with at",2019,Haemophilia
A Fast Em Algorithm for Quadratic Optimization Subject to Convex Constraints,"Convex constraints (CCs) such as box constraints and linear inequality constraints appear frequently in statistical inference and in applications. The problems of quadratic optimization (QO) subject to CCs occur in isotonic regression, shape-restricted non-parametric regression, variable selection (via the lasso algorithm and bridge regression), limited dependent variables models, image reconstruction, and so on. Existing packages for QO are not generally applicable to CCs. Although EM-type algorithms may be applied to such problems (Tian, Ng and Tan (2005)), the convergence rate/speed of these algorithms is painfully slow, especially for high-dimensional data. This paper develops a fast EM algorithm for QO with CCs. We construct a class of data augmentation schemes indexed by a â€˜working parameterâ€™ r (r âˆˆ R), and then optimize r over R under several convergence criteria. In addition, we use Cholesky decomposition to reduce both the number of latent variables and the dimension, leading to further acceleration of the EM. Standard errors of the restricted estimators are calculated using a non-parametric bootstrapping procedure. Simulation and comparison are performed and a complex multinomial dataset is analyzed to illustrate the proposed methods.",2007,
EfficientRepresentation ofMachine Learning Models â€“ investigating optimization options for decision trees in embedded systems Resurseffektiv Representation av MaskininlÃ¤rningsmodeller,"Combining embedded systems and machine learning models is an exciting prospect. However, to fully target any embedded system, with the most stringent resource requirements, the models have to be designed with care not to overwhelm it. Decision tree ensembles are targeted in this thesis. A benchmark model is created with LightGBM, a popular framework for gradient boosted decision trees. This model is first transformed and regularized with RuleFit, a LASSO regression framework. Then it is further optimized with quantization and weight sharing, techniques used when compressing neural networks. The entire process is combined into a novel framework, called ESRule. The data used comes from the domain of frequency measurements in cellular networks. There is a clear use-case where embedded systems can use the produced resource optimized models. Compared with LightGBM, ESRule uses 72Ë† less internal memory on average, simultaneously increasing predictive performance. The models use 4 kilobytes on average. The serialized variant of ESRule uses 104Ë† less hard disk space than LightGBM. ESRule is also clearly faster at predicting a single sample.",2019,

High-Dimensional Sparse Hazard Regression with Genomic Applications,"High-dimensional sparse modeling with censored survival data is of practical importance because of the need for linking complex genomic data to clinical outcomes. One major feature of genomic data sets is that the dimensionality p may greatly exceed the sample size n, so that traditional methodology, justified in the asymptotic sense that n tends to infinity with p held fixed, can easily fail. The analysis is further complicated by the fact that many genes are functionally related and organized in structural units such as regulatory networks and pathways, on which constraints from biological knowledge are typically imposed. We propose to address these challenges and improve on the existing methodology in two different directions, and justify our methods in a theoretical framework where p may grow fast, possibly nonpolynomially, with n. First, we introduce a class of regularization methods for simultaneous estimation and variable selection, and show that sparsity-inducing concave penalties can significantly relax the regularity conditions required by the L1 penalty (Lasso) for model selection consistency. Second, we propose a network-based regularization approach that effectively takes structural constraints into account. We provide further insight into the benefits of utilizing such structural knowledge and demonstrate that our method can outperform the Lasso and elastic net and lead to biologically more meaningful results and better prediction performance.

Contemporary Arab women writers,"This book engages with contemporary Arab women writers from Egypt, Palestine, Lebanon and Algeria. In spite of Edward Saidâ€™s groundbreaking reappraisal of the uneven relationship between the West and the Arab world in Orientalism, there has been little postcolonial criticism of Arab writing. Anastasia Valassopoulos raises the profile of Arab women writers by examining how they negotiate contexts and experiences that have come to be identified with postcoloniality such as the preoccupation with Western feminism, political conflict and war, the social effects of non-conformity and female empowerment, and the negotiation of influential cultural discourses such as orientalism.Contemporary Arab Women Writers revitalizes theoretical concepts associated with feminism, gender studies and cultural studies, and explores how art history, popular culture, translation studies, psychoanalysis and news media all offer productive ways to associate with Arab womenâ€™s writing that work beyond a limiting socio-historical context. Discussing the writings of authors including Ahdaf Soueif, Nawal El Saadawi, Leila Sebbar, Liana Badr and Hanan Al-Shaykh, this book represents a new direction in postcolonial literary criticism that transcends constrictive monothematic approaches.",2007,
Unbiased Prediction and Feature Selection in High-Dimensional Survival Regression,"With widespread availability of omics profiling techniques, the analysis and interpretation of high-dimensional omics data, for example, for biomarkers, is becoming an increasingly important part of clinical medicine because such datasets constitute a promising resource for predicting survival outcomes. However, early experience has shown that biomarkers often generalize poorly. Thus, it is crucial that models are not overfitted and give accurate results with new data. In addition, reliable detection of multivariate biomarkers with high predictive power (feature selection) is of particular interest in clinical settings. We present an approach that addresses both aspects in high-dimensional survival models. Within a nested cross-validation (CV), we fit a survival model, evaluate a dataset in an unbiased fashion, and select features with the best predictive power by applying a weighted combination of CV runs. We evaluate our approach using simulated toy data, as well as three breast cancer datasets, to predict the survival of breast cancer patients after treatment. In all datasets, we achieve more reliable estimation of predictive power for unseen cases and better predictive performance compared to the standard CoxLasso model. Taken together, we present a comprehensive and flexible framework for survival models, including performance estimation, final feature selection, and final model construction. The proposed algorithm is implemented in an open source R package (SurvRank) available on CRAN.",2016,Journal of Computational Biology

Survival Prediction Based on Compound Covariate under Cox Proportional Hazard Models,"Survival prediction from a large number of covariates is a current focus of statistical and medical research. In this paper, we study a methodology known as the compound covariate prediction performed under univariate Cox proportional hazard models. We demonstrate via simulations and real data analysis that the compound covariate method generally competes well with ridge regression and Lasso methods, both already well-studied methods for predicting survival outcomes with a large number of covariates. Furthermore, we develop a refinement of the compound covariate method by incorporating likelihood information from multivariate Cox models. The new proposal is an adaptive method that borrows information contained in both the univariate and multivariate Cox regression estimators. We show that the new proposal has a theoretical justification from a statistical large sample theory and is naturally interpreted as a shrinkage-type estimator, a popular class of estimators in statistical literature. Two datasets, the primary biliary cirrhosis of the liver data and the non-small-cell lung cancer data, are used for illustration. The proposed method is implemented in R package ""compound.Cox"" available in CRAN at http://cran.r-project.org/.",2012,PLoS ONE
L2Boosting for Economic Applications,"In the recent years more and more highdimensional data sets, where the number of parameters p is high compared to the number of observations n or even larger, are available for applied researchers. Boosting algorithms represent one of the major advances in machine learning and statistics in recent years and are suitable for the analysis of such data sets. While Lasso has been applied very successfully for highdimensional data sets in Economics, boosting has been underutilized in this field, although it has been proven very powerful in fields like Biostatistics and Pattern Recognition. We attribute this to missing theoretical results for boosting. The goal of this paper is to fill this gap and show that boosting is a competitive methods for inference of a treatment effect or instrumental variable (IV) estimation in a high-dimensional setting. First, we present the L2Boosting with componentwise least squares algorithm and variants which are tailored for regression problems which is the workhorse for most Econometric problems. Then we present how L2Boosting can be used for estimation of treatment effects and IV estimation. We highlight the methods and illustrate them with simulations and empirical examples. For further results and technical details we refer to (Luo and Spindler 2016) and (Luo and Spindler 2017) and to the online supplement of the paper.",2017,
"A Tool to Early Predict Severe 2019-Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (COVID-19) : A Multicenter Study using the Risk Nomogram in Wuhan and Guangdong, China","Background Severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) rapidly develop acute respiratory distress leading to respiratory failure, with high short-term mortality rates. At present, there is no reliable risk stratification tool for non-severe COVID-19 patients at admission. We aimed to construct an effective model for early identifying cases at high risk of progression to severe COVID-19. Methods SARS-CoV-2 infected patients from one center in Wuhan city and two centers in Guangzhou city, China were included retrospectively. All patients with non-severe COVID-19 during hospitalization were followed for more than 15 days after admission. Patients who deteriorated to severe or critical COVID-19 and patients who kept non-severe state were assigned to the severe and non-severe group, respectively. We compared the demographic, clinical, and laboratory data between severe and non-severe group. Based on baseline data, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm and logistic regression model were used to construct a nomogram for risk prediction in the train cohort. The predictive accuracy and discriminative ability of nomogram were evaluated by area under the curve (AUC) and calibration curve. Decision curve analysis (DCA) and clinical impact curve analysis (CICA) were conducted to evaluate the clinical applicability of our nomogram. Findings The train cohort consisted of 189 patients, while the two independent validation cohorts consisted of 165 and 18 patients. Among all cases, 72 (19.35%) patients developed severe COVID-19 and 107 (28.76%) patients had one of the following basic disease, including hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, chronic respiratory disease, tuberculosis disease. We found one demographic and six serological indicators (age, serum lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, the coefficient of variation of red blood cell distribution width (RDW), blood urea nitrogen, albumin, direct bilirubin) are associated with severe COVID-19. Based on these features, we generated the nomogram, which has remarkably high diagnostic accuracy in distinguishing individuals who exacerbated to severe COVID-19 from non-severe COVID-19 (AUC 0.912 [95% CI 0.846-0.978]) in the train cohort with a sensitivity of 85.71 % and specificity of 87.58% ; 0.853 [0.790-0.916] in validation cohort with a sensitivity of 77.5 % and specificity of 78.4%. The calibration curve for probability of severe COVID-19 showed optimal agreement between prediction by nomogram and actual observation. DCA and CICA further indicated that our nomogram conferred significantly high clinical net benefit. Interpretation Our nomogram could help clinicians to early identify patients who will exacerbate to severe COVID-19. And this risk stratification tool will enable better centralized management and early treatment of severe patients, and optimal use of medical resources via patient prioritization and thus significantly reduce mortality rates. The RDW plays an important role in predicting severe COVID-19, implying that the role of RBC in severe disease is underestimated.",2020,medRxiv
Role of Metabolic Obesity and Body Mass Index in Patients with Coronary Artery Diseases,"Obesity and its related consequences are some of the most alarming health problems the world is currently facing. Studies have shown that a little more than a fourth of the adults all over the world are overweight and a little more than a tenth are obese. Also, Obesity is considered as an independent risk factor for determining the severity of a Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). The aim of this paper is to determine the role of Metabolic Obesity and Body Mass Index in Patients with Coronary Artery Diseases. We train a model capable of predicting the GENSINI score which determines the severity of CAD in four health groups, namely Metabolically Healthy and Normal Weight (MHNW), Metabolically Obese Normal Weight (MONW), Metabolically Healthy Obese (MHO) and Metabolically Abnormally Obese (MAO). Several factors like Glycated Hemoglobin (HBA1C), Triglyceride and Insulin Resistance are considered. Ridge Regression, Lasso regression, and Neural Networks are the mechanisms used to train a model for predicting the GENSINI score based upon health statistics of patients",2018,
The properties of higher cognitive processes and how they can be modelled in neural nets,"It is proposed that the distinction between basic and higher cognitive processes can be captured by the difference between associative and relational processes. Properties of relational processing include reification of the link between entities, so higher-order relations have lower-order relations as arguments, whereas an associative link per se cannot be a component of another association. Therefore relational processes can be hierarchical and recursive, whereas associative structures are flat. Relations, unlike associations, also have the properties of omni-directional access and systematicity. Relational processes support reasoning and contentindependent transfer, and have many of the properties of symbolic models. Typical feedforward neural nets do not implement these properties in a natural way, but they can be implemented with tensor product nets. The requirements for neural nets to model higher cognitive processes are considered. The debate about the nature of higher cognition has included claims that it is symbolic, compositional and systematic, and that it cannot be modelled by associative architectures (Fodor & Pylyshyn, 1988). On the other hand it has often been shown that human reasoning does not readily conform to logic, and is better modelled by more content-specific processes such as mental models, that function as analogues (Johnson-Laird & Byrne, 1991; Niklasson & van Gelder, 1994). There has been a parallel debate about whether learning is conscious or unconscious, and whether what is learned is rule-based or instance-based (Shanks & St. John, 1994). These dichotomies also overlap to some extent with the implicit-explicit distinction (Clark & Karmiloff-Smith, 1993). As Hadley (1994) points out, we still lack a clear definition of the nature of higher cognition and, consequently, we are unable to clearly distinguish it from more basic processes. One consequence of this situation is that the criteria that neural net models of higher cognition need to fulfil have not been defined. In this paper we propose that higher cognitive processes entail representing and processing explicit relations, whereas basic processes can be identified with associations. This in turn constrains the type of neural net models that are required. Higher cognitive processes depend on a set of structure-sensitive rules for operating on representations. In language syntactic rules define relations between words (e.g. parts of speech or case roles), but reasoning also depends on rules that relate entities, partly independent of content; e.g., the idea that fruit includes apples and non-apples is an instance of complementation or (in the Psychological literature) inclusion, but we can also understand inclusion as nonempty sets a and aâ€™ being included in b, independent of specific instances. A structure is a set on which one or more relations is defined. Because relations are the essence of structure, the structural properties of higher cognitive processes can be captured by systems that process relations. However, despite its importance, and intensive study in disciplines such as computer science (Codd, 1990) the theory of relational knowledge has received little attention in Psychology (Smith, 1989). A relation that relates n entities, or n-ary relation is a subset of the cartesian product of n sets: ie. R(a 1,a2,...,an) is a subset of S 1Ã— S2Ã—... Ã—Sn. A relation must be identified by the relation symbol, R, and the entities by argument symbols, a 1,a2,...,an. For example the relation â€œlargerâ€ identifies a specific subset of a cartesian product, that subset in which the first entity is always larger than the second; i.e. a 1 > 2. The properties of cognitive processes based on relations, or relational schemas, are considered in detail by Phillips, Halford & Wilson (1995) and Halford, Wilson & Phillips (submitted). We propose that relations are links between entities that are identified by a symbol the symbolisation property. The need for labelled links is recognised in models of higher cognitive structures such as propositional networks, in which links between nodes carry labels such as â€œagentâ€, â€œobjectâ€, â€œlocationâ€. By contrast, though the point is rarely made explicitly, there seems to be agreement that associative links are all of the same kind, varying only in strength, and are unlabelled. In part because of symbolisation, higher-order relations can be defined, that have lower-order relations as arguments. Association does not share this property. Associations can be chained, so that the output of one association is the input to another: E 1 â†’ E2 â†’ E3 . . . . . â†’ En, and may converge, so that E1 and E2 elicit E3, or diverge, so that E 1 elicits E2 and E3. However associations are not identified by a symbol as relations are, and the associative link per se cannot be an argument to another association. Therefore the recursive, hierarchical structures that can be formed using higher-order relations do not appear to be possible with associations. Fodor and Pylyshyn (1988) argue that cognition depends on symbols that retain their identity when composed into complex symbols (compositionality), and have the property of systematicity, meaning that certain relations imply other relations. Relations have the compositionality property, because the symbols for the relation, and representations of arguments, retain their identity when bound into a structure. For example, in the relational instance larger(whale,dolphin), the components â€œlargerâ€, â€œwhaleâ€ and â€œdolphinâ€ retain their identity when bound into the relation. The systematicity property can be captured by higherorder relations, which have lower-order relations as arguments. Thus the fact that >(a,b) implies <(b,a), can be written as the higher-order relation IMPLIES(>(a,b),<(b,a)). The omni-directional access property of relations gives flexibility to higher cognitive processes. It means that, given all but one of the components of a relational instance, we can access (i.e. retrieve) the remaining component. For example, given the relational instance mother-of(woman,child), and given mother-of(woman,?) we can access â€œchildâ€, whereas given mother-of(?,child) we can access â€œwomanâ€, and given ?(woman,child) we can access â€œmother-ofâ€. Propositions, which are the core of some models of higher cognitive processes, can be treated as relational instances (Halford et al., submitted, section 2.2.2). For example loves(Joe,Jenny) is a proposition in that it has a truth value, but it is also a relational instance. We will develop our argument by reference to a task that has longstanding importance in the psychological literature, conditional discrimination, an example of which is shown in Figure 1. Conditional discrimination makes the correct response dependent on background (e.g. triangle is positive on a black background, but square is positive on a white background). It cannot be learned by association between stimulus elements and responses, because each response is equally associated with both stimulus elements, and with both backgrounds (e.g. R+ is associated with both triangle and square, and also with black and white). Therefore associative interference is high, and effectively blocks learning based on elemental associations. Conditional discrimination can be learned by fusing or chunking each stimulus into a unique configuration, such as triangle/black, as shown in Figure 1. The task can be learned this way because each configuration is distinct, and associative interference is reduced. The problem however is that, for each configuration to become unique, the elements must lose their identity. Thus if â€œtriangleâ€ and â€œblackâ€ become fused into a unique configuration black/triangle, which is distinct from (say) black/square or white/triangle, then the components of black/triangle lose their identity. An element within a configuration is, of necessity, no longer recognisable as the element it was. The problem then is that the structure of the task cannot be represented. The observable effect would be that the person would not be able to transfer to a problem isomorph. Conditional discrimination task background cue response",1999,Cognitive Science
"Statistical classification of multivariate flow cytometry data analyzed by manual gating: stem, progenitor, and epithelial marker expression in nonsmall cell lung cancer and normal lung.","The use of supervised classification to extract markers from primary flow cytometry data is an emerging field that has made significant progress, spurred by the growing complexity of multidimensional flow cytometry. Whether the markers are extracted without supervision or by conventional gate and region methods, the number of candidate variables identified is typically larger than the number of specimens (p > n) and many variables are highly intercorrelated. Thus, comparison across groups or treatments to determine which markers are significant is challenging. Here, we utilized a data set in which 86 variables were created by conventional manual analysis of individual listmode data files, and compared the application of five multivariate classification methods to discern subtle differences between the stem/progenitor content of 35 nonsmall cell lung cancer and adjacent normal lung specimens. The methods compared include elastic-net, lasso, random forest, diagonal linear discriminant analysis, and best single variable (best-1). We described a broadly applicable methodology consisting of: 1) variable transformation and standardization; 2) visualization and assessment of correlation between variables; 3) selection of significant variables and modeling; and 4) characterization of the quality and stability of the model. The analysis yielded both validating results (tumors are aneuploid and have higher light scatter properties than normal lung), as well as leads that require followup: Cytokeratin+ CD133+ progenitors are present in normal lung but reduced in lung cancer; diploid (or pseudo-diploid) CD117+CD44+ cells are more prevalent in tumor. We anticipate that the methods described here will be broadly applicable to a variety of multidimensional cytometry problems.",2013,Cytometry.

Pseudogene-gene functional networks are prognostic of patient survival in breast cancer,"Given the vast range of molecular mechanisms giving rise to breast cancer, it is unlikely universal cures exist. However, by providing a more precise prognosis for breast cancer patients through integrative models, treatments can become more individualized, resulting in more successful outcomes. Specifically, we combine gene expression, pseudogene expression, miRNA expression, clinical factors, and pseudogene-gene functional networks to generate these models for breast cancer prognostics. Establishing a LASSO-generated molecular gene signature revealed that the increased expression of genes STXBP5, GALP and LOC387646 indicate a poor prognosis for a breast cancer patient. We also found that increased CTSLP8 and RPS10P20 and decreased HLA-K pseudogene expression indicate poor prognosis for a patient. Perhaps most importantly we identified a pseudogene-gene interaction, GPS2-GPS2P1 (improved prognosis) that is prognostic where neither the gene nor pseudogene alone is prognostic of survival. Besides, miR-3923 was predicted to target GPS2 using miRanda, PicTar, and TargetScan, which imply modules of gene-pseudogene-miRNAs that are potentially functionally related to patient survival. In our LASSO-based model, we take into account features including pseudogenes, genes and candidate pseudogene-gene interactions. Key biomarkers were identified from the features. The identification of key biomarkers in combination with significant clinical factors (such as stage and radiation therapy status) should be considered as well, enabling a specific prognostic prediction and future treatment plan for an individual patient. Here we used our PseudoFuN web application to identify the candidate pseudogene-gene interactions as candidate features in our integrative models. We further identified potential miRNAs targeting those features in our models using PseudoFuN as well. From this study, we present an interpretable survival model based on LASSO and decision trees, we also provide a novel feature set which includes pseudogene-gene interaction terms that have been ignored by previous prognostic models. We find that some interaction terms for pseudogenes and genes are significantly prognostic of survival. These interactions are cross-over interactions, where the impact of the gene expression on survival changes with pseudogene expression and vice versa. These may imply more complicated regulation mechanisms than previously understood. We recommend these novel feature sets be considered when training other types of prognostic models as well, which may provide more comprehensive insights into personalized treatment decisions.",2020,BMC Medical Genomics
Factors Associated with Nutritional Risk among Homebound Older Adults with Depressive Symptoms.,"OBJECTIVES
This study used the Evans model of public health determinants to identify factors associated with nutritional risk in older adults.


DESIGN
The Evans model domains (physical and mental well-being, social/environmental statuses, individual choice, and economic security) were measured in a sample of homebound older adults. Regularized logistic regression analysis with LASSO penalty function was used to determine the strongest domain of the Evans model. Using traditional logistic regression, individual variables across all domains were compared to identify the significant predictors.


SETTING
Older adults receiving home meal services were referred to the study by community program staff.


PARTICIPANTS
Participants included 164 homebound older adults (age â‰¥ 60) who endorsed at least one gateway symptom of depression.


MEASUREMENTS
Nutritional risk was determined using the Mini Nutritional Assessment. Domains of the Evans model were measured using the MAI Medical Condition Checklist, items from the IADL scale, the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders, the Duke Social Support Index, living arrangements, marital status, the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, items from the SCID Screening Module, and a self-report of perceived financial security.


RESULTS
Poor mental well-being, defined by a diagnosis of major depressive disorder, was identified as the strongest Evans model domain in the prediction of nutritional risk. When each variable was independently evaluated across domains, instrumental support (Wald's Z=-2.24, p=0.03) and a history of drug use (Wald's Z=-2.40, p=0.02) were significant predictors.


CONCLUSIONS
The Evans model is a useful conceptual framework for understanding nutritional health, with the mental domain found to be the strongest domain predictor of nutritional risk. Among individual variables across domains, having someone to help with shopping and food preparation and a history of drug use were associated with lower nutritional risk. These analyses highlight potential targets of intervention for nutritional risk among older adults.",2016,The Journal of frailty & aging
Determination of General Circulation Model Grid Resolution to Improve Accuracy of Rainfall Prediction in West Java,The statistical downscaling technique is used to predict rainfall using general circulation model (GCM) data. One important factor to improve prediction accuracy is selection of GCM grid resolution. The purpose of this study is to determine the best GCM grid resolution to predict rainfall. The data used was GCM data from CFSRv2 with grid resolutions of 0.312Â°Ã—0.312Â°; 0.5Â°Ã—0.5Â°; 2.5Â°Ã—2.5Â° and local rainfall data in West Java. The determination of best grid resolution began with determining the GCM domain in each rainfall observation station based on minimum correlation value of 0.3 between GCM data and local rainfall data. The domains were evaluated by LASSO regression based on the smallest RMSEP and the largest correlation. The results showed that the best grid resolution is 2.5Â°Ã—2.5Â°.,2019,International journal of scientific and research publications
"Distinguishing the Confounding Factors: Policy Evaluation, High-Dimension and Variable Selection","Variable selection is an important question for policy evaluation when identification of the treatment effect relies on a conditional-on-observables strategy. Recent advances in variable selection methods, such as the Lasso, have been deemed useful for the econometrics of policy evaluation. The Lasso approach focuses on the computational feasibility of exhaustive model selection borrowing from procedures developed in a high-dimensional context. However, it has been seldom applied in policy evaluation works because it raises other di culties such as the choice of a parameter that sets the trade-o between t and sparsity. Two Lasso-based treatment e ect estimators are reviewed and compared on an empirical application, on which they perform well. This paper also illustrates the pitfalls of variable selection in a policy evaluation context.",2016,
"Mid-Holocene coastal environment and human activities recorded by a coastal dune in Fujian Province, China","A coastal dune, Dongshan(DS) dune in Changle of China's Fujian Province is selected as a research object based on the systematic field investigation. Combined with the environmental index analysis and geological radar images, the dune development history and paleoenvironment significance in the study area since the late Holocene are explored through optically stimulated luminescence(OSL) chronology. Results are shown as follows.(1) Five sedimentary periods and three sedimentary discontinuity in the DS dune can be defined, which reflects that the change of the East Asian monsoon, and the developmental process of DS dune are the result of regional response to the East Asian winter monsoon, and they are well correlated with volcanic activity, winter temperatures of East China and precipitation of summer monsoon at the same time.(2) Meanwhile, DS profile has preserved the sea- level change information of the Fuzhou Basin since nearly 6 ka BP. The widespread thalassocratic periods were recorded clearly in South China at 5.6-2.8 ka BP, 2.8-1.7 ka BP and 1.7-0.8 ka BP,respectively.(3) Artificiality and the mark of human activity are observed in the DS dune, and porcelain shards and conchs have been found in the cultural layer. The development processes of the DS dune accord well with the records of human activities and neolithic cultural sequences in northeast Fujian.

"Le ""lasso en cravate': une nouvelle technique pour le traitement simultanÃ© du signe de Wartenberg et des dÃ©formations en griffe des mains atteintes de paralysies cubitales.","Resume Le lasso en cravate est une technique qui permet de corriger d'une maniere active a la fois le signe de Wartenberg et la deformation en griffe du cinquieme doigt (D5), ainsi que celle du quatrieme doigt des mains cubitales. La voie d'abord est celle des lassos directs des quatrieme et cinquieme doigts avec en plus une petite contre-incision dorsale au niveau de la premiere phalange (P1) de D5. Le flechisseur commun superficiel du quatrieme doigt est divise en deux languettes jusqu'a la paume. La languette radiale est utilisee en lasso direct pour corriger la griffe du quatrieme doigt. La languette cubitale passe entre le pedicule vasculonerveux radial de D5 et P1. Elle est recuperee en dorsal par la contre-incision puis elle va cravater la base de P1 en restant superficielle par rapport au systeme extenseur, elle est finalement recuperee en palmaire en passant entre le pedicule vasculonerveux cubital de D5 et P1. Elle sera suturee a elle-meme ou a la poulie A2 en fonction de sa longueur. De septembre 1998 a avril 2003, cette technique a ete utilisee chez huit patients Ã¢ges de 21Â a 35Â ans et atteints de paralysie cubitale basse post-traumatique. Elle s'est constamment montree efficace dans la correction de ce signe ainsi que dans le traitement des griffes de D5 et du quatrieme doigt. Aucune complication n'est a deplorer. Aucune recidive de ces deformations n'est a rapporter avec un recul moyen de trois ans.",2004,Chirurgie De La Main

A review on singular perturbed delay differential equations,"In this paper, existing available literature on numerical solution of singularly perturbed and singular perturbed delay differential equations is reviewed. These equation mathematical modeling of variational problems in control theory,physical and biological phenomena like optically bistable devices, description of human pupil reflex and a variety of models for physiological processes or diseases. The purpose investigate the classof singular type problems that are solved till now using different numerical methods. The objective is to motivate the researchers to develop new methods for calculating efficient solution of such problems. There is literature to solve these typesof equations both numerically and analytically. This paper limits its coverage to the work done by numerous researchers between 2002 and 2017. l. [5] presented a singular perturbed differential equations wide range of applications in real life.In this survey we have given very brief review for the work done on singular perturbed differential equations and we have given detail review of singular perturbed delay diff The paper is organized as follow: In section two, singular perturbed differential equations are introduced and applications of these equations survey of numerical solution on singular perturbed differential equation is given. In section four, singular perturbed delay differential equations are introduced and applications of these equations are given.

Introduction to singularly perturbed differential equations A singularly perturbed differential equation differential equation in which the highest multiplied by a small parameter known as perturbation parameter. The solution of singularly perturbed differential equations (SPDE) varies rapidly in the regions called as layers which may be apparent in the solution or its derivatives often appear at the boundary of the domain.The study of solution of these equations is of great significance due to the formation of sharp boundary or interior layers when the perturbation parameter approaches to zero.

A FITM1-Related Methylation Signature Predicts the Prognosis of Patients With Non-Viral Hepatocellular Carcinoma,"Although great progress has been made in treatment against hepatitis virus infection, the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unsatisfied. Therefore, there is an unmet need to explore biomarkers or prognostic models for monitoring non-viral hepatocellular carcinoma. Accumulating evidence indicates that DNA methylation participates in carcinogenesis of malignancies. In the present study, we analyzed 101 non-viral HCC patients from TCGA database to figure out methylation-driven genes (MDGs) that might get involved in non-viral HCC pathogenesis using MethyMix algorithm. Then we picked out 8 key genes out of 137 MDGs that could affect the overall survival (OS) of both methylation and expression level. Using PCA, Uni-variate, Multi-variate, and LASSO cox regression analyses, we confirmed the potential prognostic value of these eight epigenetic genes. Ultimately, combined with immunohistochemistry (IHC), ROC, OS, and GSEA analyses, fat storage-inducing transmembrane protein1 (FITM1) was identified as a novel tumor suppressor gene in non-viral HCC and an applicable FITM1-methylation-based signature was built in a training set and validated in a testing set. Briefly, our work provides several potential biomarkers, especially FITM1, as well as a new method for disease surveillance and treatment strategy development.",2020,Frontiers in Genetics
University of Groningen (18)F-FDG PET image biomarkers improve prediction of late radiation-induced xerostomia,"Background and purpose: Current prediction of radiation-induced xerostomia 12 months after radiotherapy (Xer12m) is based on mean parotid gland dose and baseline xerostomia (Xerbaseline) scores. The hypothesis of this study was that prediction of Xer12m is improved with patient-specific characteristics extracted from F-FDG PET images, quantified in PET image biomarkers (PET-IBMs). Patients and methods: Intensity and textural PET-IBMs of the parotid gland were collected from pretreatment F-FDG PET images of 161 head and neck cancer patients. Patient-rated toxicity was prospectively collected. Multivariable logistic regression models resulting from step-wise forward selection and Lasso regularisation were internally validated by bootstrapping. The reference model with parotid gland dose and Xerbaseline was compared with the resulting PET-IBM models. Results: High values of the intensity PET-IBM (90th percentile (P90)) and textural PET-IBM (Long Run High Grey-level Emphasis 3 (LRHG3E)) were significantly associated with lower risk of Xer12m. Both PET-IBMs significantly added in the prediction of Xer12m to the reference model. The AUC increased from 0.73 (0.65â€“0.81) (reference model) to 0.77 (0.70â€“0.84) (P90) and 0.77 (0.69â€“0.84) (LRHG3E). Conclusion: Prediction of Xer12m was significantly improved with pre-treatment PET-IBMs, indicating that high metabolic parotid gland activity is associated with lower risk of developing late xerostomia. This study highlights the potential of incorporating patient-specific PET-derived functional characteristics into NTCP model development. 2017 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd. Radiotherapy and Oncology 126 (2018) 89â€“95 This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-ncnd/4.0/). F-FDG PET imaging provides functional information about the metabolic activity of tissue. This makes F-FDG PET a powerful and widely used diagnostic modality in oncology. In head and neck oncology, F-FDG PET can complement other image modalities in tumour staging and delineation for radiotherapy [1,2]. The common clinical use of F-FDG PET allows for the possibility to extract large amounts of patient-specific functional information that could contribute to prognosis for head and neck cancer (HNC) patients. Several studies have shown that PET image characteristics of the tumour can contribute to predicting overall, disease-free or event-free survival [3â€“6]. However, patient-specific image characteristics for predicting normal tissue radiation toxicities are less explored, while these are also crucial in supporting treatment decisions. Additionally, new radiation techniques (e.g. proton therapy [7] and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guided radiation [8]) may allow for better sparing of normal tissue. These new techniques demand improved prediction models, to select patients most at risk of developing toxicities [9]. Radiation-induced xerostomia is a major and frequent side effect for HNC patients, and has a considerable impact on these patientsâ€™ quality of life [10]. Conventional Normal Tissue Complication Probability (NTCP) models that predict patient-rated xerostomia are based on doseâ€“volume parameters and baseline complaints [11,12]. However, there is still a significant, unexplained variance in predicting xerostomia with these models. Therefore, the demand persists to improve the identification of patients at risk. Previous work showed that patient-specific CT characteristics of the parotid glands could significantly improve the prediction of patient-rated xerostomia, however, model performance improvement was marginal [13]. The hypothesis was that the predictive CT characteristic is related to the ratio of nonfunction to functional parotid tissue. It can be expected that this ratio would be better represented by image characteristics from functional imaging (i.e. PET or MR images). 90 F-FDG-PET-image biomarkers improve xerostomia prediction In this study, the relationship was tested between metabolic activity of the parotid gland and late xerostomia. Consequently, the patient-specific response to radiation in developing this toxicity was investigated. The purpose was to determine whether functional information from F-FDG PET images, which is quantified in PET-image biomarkers (PET-IBMs), was associated with patient-rated moderate-to-severe xerostomia 12 months after radiotherapy (Xer12m). Since current NTCP prediction models are based on parotid gland dose and baseline complaints, the study subsequently addressed whether PET-IBMs could improve on the current prediction of Xer12m Materials and methods Patient demographics and treatment F-FDG PET/CT scans were acquired of 161 HNC patients in treatment position before the start of radiotherapy. The patients were treated with definitive radiotherapy either with or without concurrent chemotherapy or cetuximab, between November 2010 and August 2015. Patients without follow-up data 12 months after radiotherapy were excluded from this study. Patients were also excluded if they underwent surgery in the head and neck area before or within one year after treatment. A detailed description of the radiotherapy protocols is given in previous studies [13,14]. In summary, all patients were treated with IMRT or VMAT using a simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) technique. The parotid glands and the swallowing structures were spared as much as possible without compromising the dose to the target volumes [14,15]. Patients received a total dose of 70 Gy (2 Gy per fraction, 5 or 6 times a week) to the primary tumour and, if present, pathological lymph nodes. A radiation dose of 54.25 Gy (1.55 Gy per fraction, 5 or 6 times a week) was delivered to the elective lymph node levels.",2018,
Natural History Observations of the Ichthyological and Herpetological Fauna on the Island of CuraÃ§ao (Netherlands),"ABSTRACT Despite increasing popularity of the island as an ecotourist destination, the ecology and natural history of many organisms native to the Lesser Antillean island of CuraÃ§ao have remained enigmatic. We document multiple new observations of the behavioral ecology of several terrestrial and aquatic vertebrates that inhabit CuraÃ§ao. We present the first report of avian predation on the endemic CuraÃ§ao whiptail lizard, Cnemidophorus murinus, suggesting these lizards play a potentially important role in this island's food web. We also document the first instance of predation by the introduced tropical house gecko. Hemidactylus mabouia, on the native Antilles gecko, Gonatodes antillensis. Tropical house geckos are thought to be displacing native geckos through a combination of niche displacement and competitive exclusion, and our finding suggests that predation on smaller native lizards may be another factor aiding the success of this introduced gecko on CuraÃ§ao. We also present repeated observational evidence that juvenile bluehead wrasses (Thalassoma bifasciatum) seek refuge among the sessile and venomous giant Caribbean sea anemones (Condylactis gigantean).",2011,

This study was carried out to assess amalgam use and waste management protocols practiced by Moroccan and Burkinabe dentists. A cross-sectional study was made of 79 in Rabat, Sale and Temara in Morocco and 56 in Ouagadougou, Bobo-Dioulasso in Burkina-Faso. The results showed that 69.5% of dental amalgam waste in Morocco vs 49.9% in Burkina-Faso was disposed with household waste which is a problem for both the environment and a risk to human being.

Inflammatory markers in late pregnancy in association with postpartum depressionâ€”A nested case-control study,"Recent studies indicate that the immune system adaptation during pregnancy could play a significant role in the pathophysiology of perinatal depression. The aim of this study was to investigate if inflammation markers in a late pregnancy plasma sample can predict the presence of depressive symptoms at eight weeks postpartum. Blood samples from 291 pregnant women (median and IQR for days to delivery, 13 and 7-23days respectively) comprising 63 individuals with postpartum depressive symptoms, as assessed by the Edinburgh postnatal depression scale (EPDSâ‰¥12) and/or the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.) and 228 controls were analyzed with an inflammation protein panel using multiplex proximity extension assay technology, comprising of 92 inflammation-associated markers. A summary inflammation variable was also calculated. Logistic regression, LASSO and Elastic net analyses were implemented. Forty markers were lower in late pregnancy among women with depressive symptoms postpartum. The difference remained statistically significant for STAM-BP (or otherwise AMSH), AXIN-1, ADA, ST1A1 and IL-10, after Bonferroni correction. The summary inflammation variable was ranked as the second best variable, following personal history of depression, in predicting depressive symptoms postpartum. The protein-level findings for STAM-BP and ST1A1 were validated in relation to methylation status of loci in the respective genes in a different population, using openly available data. This explorative approach revealed differences in late pregnancy levels of inflammation markers between women presenting with depressive symptoms postpartum and controls, previously not described in the literature. Despite the fact that the results do not support the use of a single inflammation marker in late pregnancy for assessing risk of postpartum depression, the use of STAM-BP or the novel notion of a summary inflammation variable developed in this work might be used in combination with other biological markers in the future.",2017,Psychoneuroendocrinology
A Parametric Method for Multi-Pitch Estimation,"This thesis proposes a novel method for multi-pitch estimation. The method 
operates by posing pitch estimation as a sparse recovery problem which is solved 
using convex optimization techniques. In that respect, it is an extension of an 
earlier presented estimation method based on the group-LASSO. However, by 
introducing an adaptive total variation penalty, the proposed method requires 
fewer user supplied parameters, thereby simplifying the estimation procedure. 
The method is shown to have comparable to superior performance in low noise 
environments when compared to three standard multi-pitch estimation methods 
as well as the predecessor method. Also presented is a scheme for automatic 
selection of the regularization parameters, thereby making the method more user 
friendly. Used together with this scheme, the proposed method is shown to yield 
accurate, although not statistically efficent, pitch Estimates when evaluated on synthetic speech data.",2015,
How Useful Is Bagging in Forecasting Economic Time Series? A Case Study of U.S. Consumer Price Inflation,"This article focuses on the widely studied question of whether the inclusion of indicators of real economic activity lowers the prediction mean squared error of forecasting models of U.S. consumer price inflation. We propose three variants of the bagging algorithm specifically designed for this type of forecasting problem and evaluate their empirical performance. Although bagging predictors in our application are clearly more accurate than equally weighted forecasts, median forecasts, ARM forecasts, AFTER forecasts, or Bayesian forecast averages based on one extra predictor at a time, they are generally about as accurate as the Bayesian shrinkage predictor, the ridge regression predictor, the iterated LASSO predictor, or the Bayesian model average predictor based on random subsets of extra predictors. Our results show that bagging can achieve large reductions in prediction mean-squared errors even in such challenging applications as inflation forecasting; however, bagging is not the only method capable of...",2005,Journal of the American Statistical Association

Logistic Bayesian LASSO for detecting association combining family and case-control data,"Because of the limited information from the GAW20 samples when only case-control or trio data are considered, we propose eLBL, an extension of the Logistic Bayesian LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) methodology so that both types of data can be analyzed jointly in the hope of obtaining an increased statistical power, especially for detecting association between rare haplotypes and complex diseases. The methodology is further extended to account for familial correlation among the case-control individuals and the trios. A 2-step analysis strategy was taken to first perform a genome-wise single single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) search using the Monte Carlo pedigree disequilibrium test (MCPDT) to determine interesting regions for the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) binary trait. Then eLBL was applied to haplotype blocks covering the flagged SNPs in Step 1. Several significantly associated haplotypes were identified; most are in blocks contained in protein coding genes that appear to be relevant for metabolic syndrome. The results are further substantiated with a Type I error study and by an additional analysis using the triglyceride measurements directly as a quantitative trait.",2018,BMC Proceedings
Identifying local differences with fused-MCP: an apartment rental market case study on geographical segmentation detection,"As the variety and quality of spatial data increase in recent times, the potential to analyze local characteristics based on spatial data is getting stronger. Previous spatial analysis methods structuralize the spatial autocorrelation of data by the distances between data observation points and the contiguity of the data-observed regions. It is significant for the estimation of global characteristics of spatial data. However, these approaches are not suitable for identifying local differences from the data since they assume a smooth spatial autocorrelation structure. Generalized fused lasso, which can detect local differences in spatial data, has been proposed in machine learning studies. Its limitation is that the estimated parameters are biased toward zero; however, methods that overcome the limitation have also been proposed. Fused-MCP is one of those methods and is expected to be useful in spatial analyses. This study applies fused-MCP to spatial analyses. As an example of spatial analyses based on fused-MCP, this study analyzes the structure of geographical segmentation of the real estate market in central Tokyo. Fused-MCP is utilized to extract areas where the valuation standard is the same. The results reveal that the geographical segmentation displays hierarchal patterns. Specifically, the market is divided by municipalities, railway lines and stations, and neighborhoods. The case study confirmed the applicability of fused-MCP to spatial analyses.",2020,
Sparse principal component analysis for multiblock data and its extension to sparse multiple correspondence analysis,"Two new methods to select groups of variables have been developed for multiblock data: ""Group Sparse Principal Component Analysis"" (GSPCA) for continuous variables and ""Sparse Multiple Correspondence Analysis"" (SMCA) for categorical variables. GSPCA is a compromise between Sparse PCA method of Zou, Hastie and Tibshirani and the method ""group Lasso"" of Yuan and Lin. PCA is formulated as a regression-type optimization problem and uses the constraints of the group Lasso on regression coe cients to produce modi ed principal
components with sparse loadings. It leads to reduce the number of nonzero coe cients, i.e. the number of selected groups. SMCA is a straightforward extension of GSPCA to groups of indicator variables, with the chi-square metric. Two real examples will be used to illustrate each method. The fi rst one is a data set on 25 trace elements measured in three tissues of 48 crabs (25 blocks of 3 variables). The second one is a data set of 502 women aimed at the identi cation of genes a ecting skin aging with more than 370.000 blocks, each block corresponding to SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) coded into 3 categories.",2012,

Assessment of the cardiovascular adverse effects of drug-drug interactions through a combined analysis of spontaneous reports and predicted drug-target interactions,"Adverse drug effects (ADEs) are one of the leading causes of death in developed countries and are the main reason for drug recalls from the market, whereas the ADEs that are associated with action on the cardiovascular system are the most dangerous and widespread. The treatment of human diseases often requires the intake of several drugs, which can lead to undesirable drug-drug interactions (DDIs), thus causing an increase in the frequency and severity of ADEs. An evaluation of DDI-induced ADEs is a nontrivial task and requires numerous experimental and clinical studies. Therefore, we developed a computational approach to assess the cardiovascular ADEs of DDIs. This approach is based on the combined analysis of spontaneous reports (SRs) and predicted drug-target interactions to estimate the five cardiovascular ADEs that are induced by DDIs, namely, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, ventricular tachycardia, cardiac failure, and arterial hypertension. We applied a method based on least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression to SRs for the identification of interacting pairs of drugs causing corresponding ADEs, as well as noninteracting pairs of drugs. As a result, five datasets containing, on average, 3100 ADE-causing and non-ADE-causing drug pairs were created. The obtained data, along with information on the interaction of drugs with 1553 human targets predicted by PASS Targets software, were used to create five classification models using the Random Forest method. The average area under the ROC curve of the obtained models, sensitivity, specificity and balanced accuracy were 0.838, 0.764, 0.754 and 0.759, respectively. The predicted drug targets were also used to hypothesize the potential mechanisms of DDI-induced ventricular tachycardia for the top-scoring drug pairs. The created five classification models can be used for the identification of drug combinations that are potentially the most or least dangerous for the cardiovascular system. Author summary Assessment of adverse drug effects as well as the influence of drug-drug interactions on their manifestation is a nontrivial task that requires numerous experimental and clinical studies. We developed a computational approach for the prediction of adverse effects that are induced by drug-drug interactions, which are based on a combined analysis of spontaneous reports and predicted drug-target interactions. Importantly, the approach requires only structural formulas to predict adverse effects, and, therefore, may be applied for new, insufficiently studied drugs. We applied the approach to predict five of the most important cardiovascular adverse effects, because they are the most dangerous and widespread. These effects are myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, ventricular tachycardia, arterial hypertension and cardiac failure. The accuracies of predictive models were relatively high, in the range of 73-81%; therefore, we performed a prediction of the five cardiovascular adverse effects for the large number of drug pairs and revealed the combinations that are the most dangerous for the cardiovascular system. We consider that the developed approach can be used for the identification of pairwise drug combinations that are potentially the most or least dangerous for the cardiovascular system.",2019,bioRxiv

Survival of Interior Least Tern Chicks Hatched on Gravel-covered Roofs in North Texas,"Abstract Understanding how Interior Least Tern (Sternula antillarum athalassos) chicks hatched on rooftops interact with their environment is essential in the conservation of roof nesting colonies. We observed a colony of terns nesting on gravel roofs in Denton County, Texas, in 2003 and 2004. We used focal sampling to examine how chicks behave in relation to surface temperatures and in the presence of predators. We also placed two types of structures, artificial plants and wooden teepees, on the roofs to determine whether chicks would use them for shade or for protection from predators. As surface temperature increased, chicks increased time spent under cover (whether a man-made structure or being brooded) and decreased intraspecific interactions (ducking while an adult flew over, attacking or being attacked by other terns, submissive behaviors, and posturing). As chicks matured shade use decreased and body maintenance (preening and scratching) increased. When adults were mobbing potential predators over the colony, chicks ceased body maintenance, flight muscle preparation (stretching wings or flapping wings), and intraspecific interaction. Most chicks either fell prostrate where they stood when mobbing began or ran away from the predator. The use of structures by chicks did not change in the presence or absence of potential predators. Of the two experimental structures, only artificial plants were used more than expected. Overall, chicks hatched on roofs survive high surface temperatures by relocating to shade and survive predation by running or using camouflage. Artificial plants may be important for providing shade but not for providing protection against predators.",2007,

La PCR, qui offrait une sensibilite et une specificite non egalees, a ete utilisee au CIRDES, Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso, et les resultats obtenus par cette technique pour identifier T. vivax sur les bovins et sur les pieces buccales des glossines ont ete compares aux resultats parasitologiques de plusieurs etudes recentes en Afrique de l'Ouest. Le fait le plus marquant concernait, dans certaines regions, une proportion non negligeable de mouches infectees seulement dans le proboscis (cycle de T. vivax) ne donnant aucun signal PCR avec les amorces T. vivax. Les auteurs ont envisage plusieurs hypotheses pour expliquer ces resultats, la plus probable semblant etre la circulation de souches du sous-genre Duttonella non reconnues par les marqueurs utilises. Des etudes de variabilite genetique et de pathogenicite des souches locales seraient interessantes a mener.

Bootstrap Methods for Lasso-Type Estimators Under A Moving-Parameter Framework,"We study the distributions of Lasso-type regression estimators in a moving-parameter asymptotic framework, and consider various bootstrap methods for estimating them accordingly. We show, in particular, that the distribution functions of Lasso-type estimators, including even those possessing the oracle properties such as the adaptive Lasso and the SCAD, cannot be consistently estimated by the bootstraps uniformly over the space of the regression parameters, especially when some of the regression coefficients lie close to the origin. Such lack of uniform consistency poses difficulties in practical applications of the bootstraps for making Lasso-based inferences. In the light of this seemingly negative result, we seek, however, to develop criteria for assessing the relative risks, phrased in terms of their uniform consistency properties, of the various bootstrap methods, based on which an optimal bootstrap strategy may be formulated in an adaptive manner. A simulation study is provided to demonstrate the non-normal nature of the distributions of Lasso-type estimators, and to assess the performances of various bootstrap estimates of such distributions across different values of regression parameters.",2012,
Using New Models to Analyze Complex Regularities of the World,"This commentary to the recent article by Musso et al. (2013) discusses issues related to model fitting, comparison of classification accuracy of generative and discriminative models, and two (or more) cultures of data modeling. We start by questioning the extremely high classification accuracy with an empirical data from a complex domain. There is a risk that we model perfect nonsense perfectly. Our second concern is related to the relevance of comparing multilayer perceptron neural networks and linear discriminant analysis classification accuracy indices. We find this problematic, as it is like comparing apples and oranges. It would have been easier to interpret the model and the variable (group) importanceâ€™s if the authors would have compared MLP to some discriminative classifier, such as group lasso logistic regression. Finally, we conclude our commentary with a discussion about the predictive properties of the adopted data modeling approach.",2014,
The late Hallstatt chieftain's grave at Hochdorf,"The roots of Celtic civilization can be seen to lie in the hill strongholds of late Hallstatt period in Eastern France, Switzerland and Southern Germany, distinguished by their Mediterranean contacts: these have been classed as the residences of chieftains, Furstensitze , by Kimmig (1968). Three of these Furstensitze have particularly attracted archaeological attention in the last 30 years, in Southern Germany, the Heuneburg on the Upper Danube (Kimmig, 1968; Kimmig/Gersbach, 1971), and the Hohenasperg near Ludwigsburg (Zurn, 1970), and in Burgundy Mt Lassois near ChÃ¢tillonsur-Seine (Joffroy, 1960). The excavation of the Heuneburg was mainly confined to the settlement site itself, whereas we know the Hohenasperg only from the graves surrounding the site. The excavation of the Grafenbuhl tumulus by Hartwig Zurn in 1964/65 (Zurn, 1970) has shown, however, that the importance of the Hohenasperg must have been at least equal to that of the Heuneburg.",1981,Antiquity
Drag increase and drag reduction found in phytoplankton and bacterial cultures in laminar flow: Are cell surfaces and EPS producing rheological thickening and a Lotus-leaf Effect?,"The laminar-flow viscosity of ocean and other natural waters consists of a Newtonian aqueous component contributed by water and salts, and a non-Newtonian one contributed mainly by exopolymeric polymers (EPS) derived largely from planktonic algae and bacteria. Phytoplankton and EPS form thin layers in stratified waters, often associated with density discontinuities. A recent model (Jenkinson and Sun, 2011. J. Plankton Res., 33, 373-383) investigated possible thalassorheological control of pycnocline thickness (PT) by EPS secreted by the harmful dinoflagellate Karenia mikimotoi. The model, based on published measurements of viscosity increase by this species, found that whether it can influence PT depends on the relationship between increased viscosity, deformation rates/stresses and length scale, which the present work has investigated. To do this, flow rate vs. hydrostatic pressure (and hence wall stress) was measured in cultures (relative to that in reference water) in capillaries of 5 radii 0.35-1.5 mm, close to oceanic-turbulence Kolmogorov length. We compared cultures of the potentially harmful algae, K. mikimotoi, Alexandrium catenella, Prorocentrum donghaiense, Skeletonema costatum, Phaeodactylum tricornutum and the bacterium Escherichia colt. Drag increase, ascribed to rheological thickening by EPS, occurred in the smallest capillaries, but drag reduction (DR) occurred in the largest ones. Since this occurred at Reynolds numbers Re too small for turbulence (or turbulent DR) to occur, this was laminar-flow DR. It may have been superhydrophobic DR (SDR), associated with the surfaces of the plankton and bacteria. SDR is associated with the self-cleaning Lotus-leaf Effect, in which water and dirt are repelled from surfaces bearing nm- to mu m-sized irregularities coated with hydrophobic polymers. Because DR decreased measured viscosity and EPS thickening increased it, we could not validate the model. DR, however, represents hitherto unknown phenomenon in the oceans. Along with rheological thickening, Laminar-Flow DR may represent a new tool for plankton to manage ambient flow fields. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

IsoLasso: A LASSO Regression Approach to RNA-Seq Based Transcriptome Assembly,"The new second generation sequencing technology revolutionizes many biology-related research fields and poses various computational biology challenges. One of them is transcriptome assembly based on RNA-Seq data, which aims at reconstructing all full-length mRNA transcripts simultaneously from millions of short reads. In this article, we consider three objectives in transcriptome assembly: the maximization of prediction accuracy, minimization of interpretation, and maximization of completeness. The first objective, the maximization of prediction accuracy, requires that the estimated expression levels based on assembled transcripts should be as close as possible to the observed ones for every expressed region of the genome. The minimization of interpretation follows the parsimony principle to seek as few transcripts in the prediction as possible. The third objective, the maximization of completeness, requires that the maximum number of mapped reads (or ?expressed segments? in gene models) be explained by (i.e., contained in) the predicted transcripts in the solution. Based on the above three objectives, we present IsoLasso, a new RNA-Seq based transcriptome assembly tool. IsoLasso is based on the well-known LASSO algorithm, a multivariate regression method designated to seek a balance between the maximization of prediction accuracy and the minimization of interpretation. By including some additional constraints in the quadratic program involved in LASSO, IsoLasso is able to make the set of assembled transcripts as complete as possible. Experiments on simulated and real RNA-Seq datasets show that IsoLasso achieves, simultaneously, higher sensitivity and precision than the state-of-art transcript assembly tools.",2011,Journal of computational biology : a journal of computational molecular cell biology
High-Affinity Antibody Detection with a Bivalent Circularized Peptide Containing Antibody-Binding Domains.,"Direct chemical labeling of antibody produces molecules with poorly defined modifications. Use of a small antibody-binding protein as an adapter can simplify antibody functionalization by forming a specific antibody-bound complex and introducing site-specific modifications. To stabilize a noncovalent antibody complex that may be used without chemical crosslinking, a bivalent antibody-binding protein is engineered with an improved affinity of interaction by joining two Z domains with a conformationally flexible linker. The linker is essential for the increase in affinity because it allows simultaneous binding of both domains. The molecule is further circularized using a split intein, creating a novel adapter protein (""lasso""), which binds human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) with K D â€‰=â€‰0.53â€‰n m and a dissociation rate that is 55- to 84-fold slower than Z. The lasso contains a unique cysteine for conjugation with a reporter and may be engineered to introduce other functional groups, including a biotin tag and protease recognition sequences. When used in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), the lasso generates a stronger reporter signal compared to a secondary antibody and lowers the limit of detection by 12-fold. The small size of the lasso and a long half-life of dissociation make the peptide a useful tool in antibody detection and immobilization.",2019,Biotechnology journal
"Estructura de las comunidades de peces de las bahÃ­as Maguey y Cacaluta, Huatulco, Oaxaca Structure of fish communities in Maguey and Cacaluta bays, Huatulco, Oaxaca","This study describes the composition and structure of the fish communities in Maguey and Cacaluta Bays. Ichthyofauna was characterized using transect visual census in February, April and July of 2004. A census was taken in both localities of 2 874 individuals belonging to 42 species. Pomacentridae and Labridae were the families that were most represented. Thalassoma lucasanum, Chromis atrilobata, Stegastes acapulcoensis and Microspathodon dorsalis were the dominant species. Composition, species richness, abundance, diversity and dominance presented notable spatial differentiation, making it possible to distinguish 3 ictic components in each locality: sandy, rocky and coralline. The coralline component registered the greatest species richness, abundance and diversity due to the high structural complexity of its environment. The sandy component presented the greatest dominance. The dry seasons presented the greatest abundance, primarily determined by the increase in the abundance of C. atrilobata and T. lucasanum. The greatest species richness and diversity was present during rainy seasons, likely due to high temperatures and high production associated with regional coastal processes.",2013,
"Regulation Techniques for Multicollinearity : Lasso , Ridge , and Elastic Nets","Multicollinearity can be briefly described as the phenomenon in which two or more identified predictor variables are linearly related, or codependent. The presence of this phenomenon can have a negative impact on an analysis as a whole and can severely limit the conclusions of a research study. In this paper, we will briefly review how to detect multicollinearity, and once it is detected, which regularization techniques would be the most appropriate to combat it. The nuances and assumptions of R1 (Lasso), R2 (Ridge Regression), and Elastic Nets will be covered in order to provide adequate background for appropriate analytic implementation. This paper is intended for any level of SASÂ® user. This paper is also written to an audience with a background in theoretical and applied statistics, though the information within will be presented in such a way that any level of statistics/mathematical knowledge will be able to understand the content.",2018,
Discussion : â€œ a Significance Test for the Lasso,"We wholeheartedly congratulate Lockhart, Taylor, Tibshrani and Tibshrani on the stimulating paper, which provides insights into statistical inference based on the lasso solution path. The authors proposed novel covariance statistics for testing the significance of predictor variables as they enter the active set, which formalizes the data-adaptive test based on the lasso path. The observation that â€œshrinkageâ€ balances â€œadaptivityâ€ to yield to an asymptotic Exp(1) null distribution is inspiring, and the mathematical analysis is delicate and intriguing. Adopting the notation from the paper under discussion, the main results are that the covariance statistics (Theorem 1)",2014,

Much of the microcin J25 leader peptide is dispensable.,"The antimicrobial peptide microcin J25 (MccJ25) is matured by two enzymes, McjB and McjC, from a 58 amino acid (aa) preprotein, McjA, into its final 21 aa lasso topology. Herein we have investigated the role of the leader peptide of McjA and found that only the eight C-terminal amino acids of this leader peptide are required for maturation of MccJ25. There is a high content of lysine residues in the McjA leader peptide, but herein we also demonstrate that these charged amino acids do not play a major role in the maturation of MccJ25. Alanine scanning mutagenesis studies revealed that the Thr-35 residue in the leader peptide is critical for correct processing of McjA into mature MccJ25. In the absence of detailed structural and biochemical data about McjB and McjC, these studies allow us to propose a putative role for the leader peptide as a simple motif for docking of the McjA preprotein in the maturation enzymes.",2010,Journal of the American Chemical Society
Support Recovery for Sparse Super-Resolution of Positive Measures,"We study sparse spikes super-resolution over the space of Radon measures on $$\mathbb {R}$$R or $$\mathbb {T}$$T when the input measure is a finite sum of positive Dirac masses using the BLASSO convex program. We focus on the recovery properties of the support and the amplitudes of the initial measure in the presence of noise as a function of the minimum separation t of the input measure (the minimum distance between two spikes). We show that when $${w}/\lambda $$w/Î», $${w}/t^{2N-1}$$w/t2N-1 and $$\lambda /t^{2N-1}$$Î»/t2N-1 are small enough (where $$\lambda $$Î» is the regularization parameter, w the noise and N the number of spikes), which corresponds roughly to a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio and a noise level small enough with respect to the minimum separation, there exists a unique solution to the BLASSO program with exactly the same number of spikes as the original measure. We show that the amplitudes and positions of the spikes of the solution both converge toward those of the input measure when the noise and the regularization parameter drops to zero faster than $$t^{2N-1}$$t2N-1.",2017,Journal of Fourier Analysis and Applications
Clinical application of intracardiac echocardiography in the ablation of atrial fibrillation,"Background : The application of intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) in atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation may increase the success rate and decrease the complication rate of the procedure. We present our preliminary observations concerning the utility of ICE in AF ablation. 
Methods : In February and July 2004 we performed 6 radiofrequency (RF) ablations guided by ICE (EP Med Systems) in patients with atrial tachyarrhythmia. All patients had undergone at least three months of oral anticoagulation therapy before the procedure. For three days before ablation enoxaparin was administered. During each procedure the ICE catheter was placed in the right atrium. Transseptal puncture was guided by fluoroscopy and ICE imaging. After placement of the introducer in the left atrium a bolus of heparin (100 IU/kg) was administered followed by additional boluses (1000 IU/h). Electroanatomical isolation of the pulmonary vein ostia was performed with a 4 mm ablation catheter (RF energy was set at 50â€“55 o C and 25â€“35 W). RF energy was titrated if microbubble formation was observed and delivery was immediately terminated when a brisk shower of bubbles was detected. 
Results : Transseptal puncture was performed at a typical location in all patients (atypical anatomy was not revealed by ICE). The microbubble effect was observed in all patients. In 1 patient the effect was observed despite a power reduction and the RF application had to be terminated. The following short (15-20 s) applications were performed with low RF energy. During the same procedure ICE imaging revealed 2 thrombi (2 and 5 mm) on the Lasso electrode. None of the patients experienced thromboembolic complications. 
Conclusions : Intracardiac echocardiography is a useful imaging method in RF ablation. Low RF-energy and standard anticoagulation treatment do not prevent the microbubble effect and the formation of small thrombi.",2006,Cardiology Journal
