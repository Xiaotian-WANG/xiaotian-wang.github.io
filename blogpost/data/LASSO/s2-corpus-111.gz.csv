The Cross-Section of Individual Equity Option Returns,"We examine a large set of potential determinants of expected option returns to identify the characteristics that can predict the expected returns of individual equity options. We use the adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) to select the characteristics that provide independent information for the cross-section of options returns. Based on the selected characteristics, we suggest new profitable option portfolio strategies. The systematic patterns in the valuation of options relative to the identified characteristics offer important implications for option market efficiency, as well as option pricing models. We propose a set of tradable option portfolio strategies based on the identified characteristics, which yield average monthly out-of-sample return of up to 1.12%.

Recovering Structured Data From Superimposed Non-Linear Measurements,"This work deals with the problem of distributed data acquisition under non-linear communication constraints. More specifically, we consider a model setup where <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$M$ </tex-math></inline-formula> <italic>distributed nodes</italic> take individual measurements of an unknown <italic>structured source vector</italic> <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$ \boldsymbol {x}_{0}\in \mathbb {R}^{n}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>, communicating their readings simultaneously to a <italic>central receiver</italic>. Since this procedure involves collisions and is usually imperfect, the receiver measures a <italic>superposition of non-linearly distorted signals</italic>. In a first step, we will show that an <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$s$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-sparse vector <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$ \boldsymbol {x}_{0}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> can be successfully recovered from <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$ O(s \cdot \log (2n/s)$ </tex-math></inline-formula> of such superimposed measurements, using a traditional Lasso estimator that does not rely on any knowledge about the non-linear corruptions.

On the Q-linear convergence of forward-backward splitting method and uniqueness of optimal solution to Lasso,"In this paper, by using tools of second-order variational analysis, we study the popular forward-backward splitting method with Beck-Teboulle's line-search for solving convex optimization problem where the objective function can be split into the sum of a differentiable function and a possible nonsmooth function. We first establish that this method exhibits global convergence to an optimal solution of the problem (if it exists) without the usual assumption that the gradient of the differentiable function involved is globally Lipschitz continuous. We also obtain the $o(k^{-1})$ complexity for the functional value sequence when this usual assumption is weaken from global Lipschitz continuity to local Lipschitz continuity, improving the existing $\mathcal{O}(k^{-1})$ complexity result. We then derive the local and global Q-linear convergence of the method in terms of both the function value sequence and the iterative sequence, under a general metric subregularity assumption which is automatically satisfied for convex piecewise-linear-quadratic optimization problems. In particular, we provide verifiable sufficient conditions for metric subregularity assumptions, and so, local and global Q-linear convergence of the proposed method for broad structured optimization problems arise in machine learning and signal processing including Poisson linear inverse problem, the partly smooth optimization problems, as well as the $\ell_1$-regularized optimization problems. Our results complement the current literature by providing $Q$-linear convergence result to the forward-backward splitting method under weaker assumptions. Moreover, via this approach, we obtain several full characterizations for the uniqueness of optimal solution to Lasso problem, which covers some recent results in this direction.",2018,arXiv: Optimization and Control
Iranian hospital efficiency: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"PURPOSE
The purpose of this paper (systematic review and meta-analysis) is to synthesize and analyze studies that assessed Iranian hospital efficiency.


DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH
A systematic literature search was conducted using both international (the Institute for Scientific Information, Scopus and PubMed) and Iranian scientific (Magiran, IranMedex and Scientific Information Database) databases. The review included original studies that used the Pabon Lasso Model to examine Iranian hospital performance, published in Persian or English. A self-administered checklist was used to collect data. In total, 12 questions were used for quality assessment.


FINDINGS
In total, 34 studies met our inclusion criteria. The fixed-effects meta-analysis indicated that 19.2 percent (95% confidence interval (CI): 15.6-23.2 percent) of hospitals were in Zone 1 (poor performance: low bed turnover rate (BTR) and bed occupancy rate (BOR) and high average hospital stay (ALoS)), 23.7 percent (95% CI: 20.1-27.8 percent) were in Zone 2, 31.7 percent (95% CI: 27.7-36 percent) in Zone 3 (good performance: high BTR and BOR and low ALoS) and 25.4 percent (95% CI: 21.7-29.5 percent) in Zone 4.


PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS
Results help Iranian health policymakers to understand hospital performance, which, in turn, may lead to promoting greater awareness and policy attention to improve Iranian hospital efficiency.


ORIGINALITY/VALUE
This study indicated that most Iranian hospitals had sub-optimal performance. Further studies are required to understand factors that explain the country's hospital inefficiency.",2019,International journal of health care quality assurance
From Sparse Regression to Sparse Multiple Correspondence Analysis,"High dimensional data means that the number of variables p if far larger
than the number of observations n.
This talk starts from a survey of various solutions in linear regression .
When p n the OLS estimator does not exist . Since it is a case of forced multi-
collinearity, one may use regularized techniques such as ridge regression, principal
component regression or PLS regression which keep all the predictors.
However if p n combinations of all variables cannot be interpreted. Sparse so-
lutions, ie with a large number of zero coe cients, are preferred. Lasso, elastic net,
sparse PLS perform simultaneously regularization and variable selection thanks to
non quadratic penalties: L1, SCAD etc.
In PCA, the singular value decomposition shows that if we regress principal com-
ponents onto the input variables, the vector of regression coe cients is equal to the
factor loadings. It su ces to adapt sparse regression techniques to get sparse ver-
sions of PCA and of PCA with groups of variables. We conclude by a presentation of
a sparse version of Multiple Correspondence Analysis and give several applications.",2013,
Lâ€™ostetrica e la fitoterapia,"La gravidanza, il parto e il periodo dellâ€™allattamento costituiscono una delle fasi piu delicate della vita di una donna. Il corpo subisce vistosi cambiamenti e fattori fisiologici come il ricambio ormonale, la stanchezza fisica e il manifestarsi di alcuni disturbi, sono spesso accompagnati da problemi di natura psicologica ed emotiva. 
Le erbe medicinali assunte in questa fase sotto stretto ed attento controllo medico possono alleviare una parte di questi disturbi e giovare alla salute della gestante e del bambino. Spesso le erbe aiutano a recuperare le energie, hanno azione rilassante e migliorano il tono dellâ€™umore stimolando le funzioni dei vari organi. Sono inoltre efficaci nel controllo dei sintomi come la nausea mattutina, la stitichezza ed il bruciore di stomaco. E importante cercare di avere un atteggiamento equilibrato nei confronti di questo evento e di viverlo come la naturale realizzazione della propria femminilita; per fare questo e necessario avere cura di se, ritagliarsi del tempo per riflettere serenamene e per seguire ritmi di vita equilibrati cercando di dormire piu ore, condurre una vita sana, non bere alcolici e non assumere dosi elevate di sostanze eccitanti (te, caffe). Spesso le tisane possono rivelarsi un rimedio contro la stanchezza fisica, una lieve depressione o semplicemente contro lo stress. Durante il puerperio, evento faticoso per lâ€™organismo, il corpo ha bisogno di ritrovare il proprio equilibrio. E importante riabilitare la muscolatura perineale, per prevenire il prolasso uterino, lâ€™incontinenza urinaria; e importante anche riattivare con esercizi mirati la circolazione negli arti inferiori, rassodare la muscolatura addominale. In puerperio sono utili massaggi agli arti inferiori con oli essenziali di rosmarino, lavanda e arancio amaro, per riattivare la microcircolazione. E sempre consigliabile diluire tali oli con un olio base come quello di mandorle o di germe di grano e massaggiare sempre dal basso verso lâ€™alto, direzionando il massaggio verso il cuore",2008,
Efficient cross-trait penalized regression increases prediction accuracy in large cohorts using secondary phenotypes,"We introduce cross-trait penalized regression (CTPR), a powerful and practical approach for multi-trait polygenic risk prediction in large cohorts. Specifically, we propose a novel cross-trait penalty function with the Lasso and the minimax concave penalty (MCP) to incorporate the shared genetic effects across multiple traits for large-sample GWAS data. Our approach extracts information from the secondary traits that is beneficial for predicting the primary trait based on individual-level genotypes and/or summary statistics. Our novel implementation of a parallel computing algorithm makes it feasible to apply our method to biobank-scale GWAS data. We illustrate our method using large-scale GWAS data (~1M SNPs) from the UK Biobank (Nâ€‰=â€‰456,837). We show that our multi-trait method outperforms the recently proposed multi-trait analysis of GWAS (MTAG) for predictive performance. The prediction accuracy for height by the aid of BMI improves from R2â€‰=â€‰35.8% (MTAG) to 42.5% (MCPâ€‰+â€‰CTPR) or 42.8% (Lassoâ€‰+â€‰CTPR) with UK Biobank data.Information of genetic architectures of complex traits can be leveraged for predicting phenotypes. Here, the authors develop CTPR (Cross-Trait Penalized Regression), a method for multi-trait polygenic risk prediction using individual-level genotypes and/or summary statistics from large cohorts.",2019,Nature Communications
"Sequence Stratigraphy of Well DX, Gongola Sub-Basin, Upper Benue Trough, Nigeria",": Biostratigraphic study of Well DX has yielded Cretaceous miospores and dinoflagellates cysts which heightened the recognition of sequence boundaries (SB), Maximum Flooding Surfaces (MFS) and associated Systems Tracts. Five maximum flooding surfaces between 95.6 Ma and 89.0 Ma, four sequence boundaries between 96.4 Ma and 93.0 Ma and threedepositional sequences were identified with varying average thicknesses of sediments interpreted from the gamma ray log and biostratigraphic data. The threedepositional sequences interpreted are -depositional sequence I (96.4 Ma - 95.4 Ma) (8240 ft. - 8120 ft.), depositional sequence II (95.4 Ma - 94.0 Ma) (8120 ft. - 7850 ft.) and depositionalsequence III (94.0 Ma - 93.0 Ma) (7850 ft. - 7550 ft.). All the depositional sequences fall within the third order cycle. The age of the well was attempted based on the presence of some selected marker fossils - Ephedripites spp., Classopollis spp., Spiniferites spp., Cyclonephelium distinctum, Cyclonephelium vannophorum, Subtilisphaera spp., Eucomiidites spp., Triorites africaensis, Odontochitina costata and Droseridites senonicus recovered from the studied intervals and was dated Albian - Santonian. The Sequence stratigraphic interpretations are useful in further deepening the knowledge of thesubsurface geology of the studiedwell in Gongola Sub Basin, Upper Benue Trough of Nigeria.

The Generalized Lasso With Non-Linear Observations,"We study the problem of signal estimation from non-linear observations when the signal belongs to a low-dimensional set buried in a high-dimensional space. A rough heuristic often used in practice postulates that the non-linear observations may be treated as noisy linear observations, and thus, the signal may be estimated using the generalized Lasso. This is appealing because of the abundance of efficient, specialized solvers for this program. Just as noise may be diminished by projecting onto the lower dimensional space, the error from modeling non-linear observations with linear observations will be greatly reduced when using the signal structure in the reconstruction. We allow general signal structure, only assuming that the signal belongs to some set K âŠ‚ Rn. We consider the single-index model of non-linearity. Our theory allows the non-linearity to be discontinuous, not one-to-one and even unknown. We assume a random Gaussian model for the measurement matrix, but allow the rows to have an unknown covariance matrix. As special cases of our results, we recover near-optimal theory for noisy linear observations, and also give the first theoretical accuracy guarantee for 1-b compressed sensing with unknown covariance matrix of the measurement vectors.",2016,IEEE Transactions on Information Theory
Group Lasso with Overlaps: the Latent Group Lasso approach,"We study a norm for structured sparsity which leads to sparse linear predictors whose supports are unions of prede ned overlapping groups of variables. We call the obtained formulation latent group Lasso, since it is based on applying the usual group Lasso penalty on a set of latent variables. A detailed analysis of the norm and its properties is presented and we characterize conditions under which the set of groups associated with latent variables are correctly identi ed. We motivate and discuss the delicate choice of weights associated to each group, and illustrate this approach on simulated data and on the problem of breast cancer prognosis from gene expression data.",2011,ArXiv
Syddansk Universitet Optical constants and structural properties of thin gold films,"We report a comprehensive experimental study of optical and electrical properties of thin polycrystalline gold films in a wide range of film thicknesses (from 20 to 200 nm). Our experimental results are supported by theoretical calculations based on the measured morphology of the fabricated gold films. We demonstrate that the dielectric function of the metal is determined by its structural morphology. Although the fabrication process can be absolutely the same for different films, the dielectric function can strongly depend on the film thickness. Our studies show that the imaginary part of the dielectric function of gold, which is responsible for optical losses, rapidly increases as the film thickness decreases for thicknesses below 80 nm. At the same time, we do not observe a noticeable dependence of optical constants on the film thickness for thicker samples. These findings establish design rules for thin-film plasmonic and nanophotonic devices.

Plasma Exchange in Anti-GBM Disease,"The last two decades have witnessed a striking increase in knowledge of immunological mechanisms responsible for allergic glomerular injury. One particular type has received much attention â€” that in which disease is caused by the development of auto-antibodies to glomerular basement membrane (GBM). The pathogenetic role of these autoantibodies was firmly established by the experiment of Glassock et al. [4] in which they showed that injection of antibody eluted from diseased kidneys could reproduce the nephritis in subhuman primates. In 1974 development of a sensitive radio-immune assay allowed detection and quantitation of circulating antibodies to GBM in patients with nephritis of this kind [12], An important finding of general and particular theoretical interest was the observation in 1978 that approximately 90% of these cases were HLA-DRW2 (compared with 32% of matched controls) [10]. Paralleling these developments in human disease attempts were made to modify nephritis in suitable experimental models to provide guidelines for therapeutic intervention in man. Here it was shown that disease activity could be altered by (a) inhibition of antibody synthesis by immunosuppressive drugs [11], (b) interference with humoral inflammatory mediators such as complement [1] or coagulation factors [7] or (c) depletion of polymorphonuclear leucocytes [8]. However, in man cytotoxic drugs, steroids and anti-coagulants aimed at producing immunosuppression and/or interfering with mediator mechanisms had little success.",1981,

Assessing Site Effects and Geographic Transferability when Interpolating Point Referenced Spatial Data: A Digital Soil Mapping Case Study,"When making inferences concerning the environment, ground truthed data will frequently be available as point referenced (geostatistical) observations that are clustered into multiple sites rather than uniformly spaced across the area of interest. In such situations, the similarity of the dominant processes influencing the observed data across sites and the accuracy with which models fitted to data from one site can predict data from another site provide valuable information for scientists seeking to make inferences from these data. Such information may motivate a more informed second round of modelling of the data and also provides insight into the generality of the models developed and an indication of how these models may perform at predicting observations from other sites. We have investigated the geographic transferability of site specific models and compared the results of using different implementations of site specific effects in models for data combined from two sites. Since we have access to data on a broad collection of environmental characteristics that each held potential to aid the interpolation of our geostatistical response observations we have investigated these issues within the framework of a computationally efficient method for variable selection when the number of explanatory variables exceeds the number of observations. We have applied Least Absolute Shrinkage Selection Operator (LASSO) regularized Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) as fitted by the computationally efficient Least Angle Regression algorithm. The response variable in our case study, soil carbon, is of interest as a potential location for the sequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide and for its positive contribution to soil health and fertility.",2016,arXiv: Applications
Î¸-curves in proteins,"Apart from the knots formed by the main-chain, the proteins can form numerous topological structures, when included the covalent and ion-mediated interactions. In this work, we define the protein non-trivial Î¸-curves and identify 7 different topologies in all structures known up to date. We study the correlation of the motif with the function and organism of origin, and pointing the similarity with main-chain knots, we show that some motifs may indeed be functional. We also analyze the folding and bridge-induced stability of an exemplary protein with Î¸-curve motif and provide a catalogue of possible Î¸-curves in proteins. Protein chains form numerous topologically complex structures, including knots [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], slipknots [8, 9], or links [10, 11, 12]. Additionally, the covalent loops formed by the disulfide bridge may be pierced forming a lasso [13, 10, 14] or socalled cysteine knots [15, 16], or pierce one another, forming (deterministic) links [17, 18, 19, 20]. Besides being appealing from the viewpoint of fundamental studies, such motifs were proved to be important for the proteinâ€™s function or mechanical properties [21, 22, 23, 24, 17, 25, 26, 27, 28]. However, the net of interactions resulting from the existence of intra-chain interactions creates much reacher world of topologically complex structures, some of which cannot be assigned to any class discussed. One of such motifs are Î¸-curves (Fig. 1). The Î¸-curves are embeddings of the Greek letter Î¸ in the 3D space. Two embedding are equivalent if they can be transformed one into another by any continuous transformation, which does not involve the chain intersection. In proteins, the trivial Î¸-curve motif (equivalent to the planar embedding of the letter Î¸) is present within many proteins with internal bridges, e.g. in small, well-known proteins, such as Î±-amantin or Î¸-defensin (Fig. 1A). It is, however, interesting to ask, if there are any non-trivial Î¸-curves in proteins (Fig. 1B)? Positive answer immediately results in a question about origin and function of such motif. On the other hand, if there is no non-trivial Î¸-curve in proteins, one may wonder why and if there is any way to create them? Figure 1: Simplest Î¸-curves in proteins and classification of the Î¸-curve motif. (A) The Î±amantin (top, PDB code 6exvM) and the Î¸-defensin (bottom, PDB code 2atg) â€“ cyclic oligopeptides with the bridges (shown explicitly) implying the existence of trivial Î¸-curves (Î¸01). In the case of Î¸-defensin 3 bridges imply the existence of 10 different trivial motifs (one marked schematically). (B) The exemplary Î¸-curves as classified in [29]. In this work, we challenge these questions. The paper is divided into four parts. The first one is devoted to the identification and classification of the non-trivial Î¸-curve motif present in all known protein structures.

To further specify the local Î¸-curve geometry and distinguish between different Î¸-curve spatial realization, we assign to each motif its â€œknotoid contentâ€, i.e. the triple of knotoids (â€œopen-chain knotsâ€) constituting given Î¸-curve. In the second part, we utilize the classification to study the motif-function relation. We also analyze the motif conservation and organism of origin. In particular, we show the correlation with analogous features of main-chain knotted proteins and point to the cases, where the Î¸-curve motif may not be accidental. In the third part, we analyze the folding and the influence of the bridges on the stabilization of the protein, in comparison with analogous effects in proteins with main-chain knot and deterministic links. In particular, we show, that formation of the nontrivial structure in case of protein Î¸-curve does not correlate with the folding barrier. In the last part we aim in creating a catalogue of all possible non-trivial Î¸-curve motifs, which could be obtained either by introducing a bridge, or by synthesis of new, artificial proteins.",2019,
Annahme von Kleintierdurchlaessen - Einfluss der Laufsohlenbeschaffenheit und des Kleinklimas auf die erfolgreiche Durchquerung,"Das vierjaehrige Forschungsprojekt verfolgte das Ziel, den moeglichen Einfluss der Laufsohlenbeschaffenheit und des Mikroklimas vor und in Durchlaessen von Amphibienschutzanlagen auf die erfolgreiche Durchquerung zu ergruenden. Es sollte geklaert werden, welche Verhaltensweisen Amphibien und andere Kleintiere bei der Tunneldurchquerung zeigen, welche physikalischen und mikroklimatischen Eigenschaften verschiedene Durchlasstypen und Laufsohlen haben und wie diese Einfluesse das Verhalten der Tiere beeinflussen. Das Ziel lag schliesslich in einer konzeptionellen Betrachtung zum optimalen Einsatz sowie zur Gestaltung und Unterhaltung derartiger Strassenbauwerke. Untersucht wurden Hygroskopizitaet und Alkalitaet, Magnetfeldmuster, Vibrationen und verkehrsbedingte Laermentwicklungen sowie die Lichtverteilung am Durchlasseingang. Gemessen wurden ausserdem Lufttemperatur, Luftfeuchtigkeit, Windgeschwindigkeit und deren Austrocknungswirkung. In abgezaeunten Versuchsarenen wurden eingesetzte Amphibien verschiedenen Wahlexperimenten ausgesetzt sowie die Auswirkungen auf das Verhalten anwandernder Tiere an Durchlaessen mit vorgenommenen Veraenderungen analysiert. Getestet wurden folgende Parameter: Ferromagnetismus, Lichtblitze vorbeifahrender Autos, Beleuchtung des Durchlasses, Luftzug und Laerm im Durchlass, Bodenfeuchtigkeit vor und im Durchlass, Versteckplatzangebote im Durchlass und Zuleitung zur Durchlassoeffnung. Ausserdem wurde die Effizienz eines nachtraeglich eingebauten Einfallrohrs ueberprueft. Gut gewaesserte Betonbauteile erwiesen sich als unwesentlich hygroskopisch. Viele Betonbauteile waren nur im oberen Tunnelbereich deutlich alkalisch, die Laufbereiche aber immer pH-neutral. Das Erdmagnetfeld wurde an Metallzaeunen und metallarmierten Betonbauteilen aller Anlagen stark veraendert und fiel dadurch als Orientierungsmoeglichkeit fuer anwandernde und querende Tiere voellig aus. Tunnel mit schallhartem Betonboden waren lauter als Stelztunnel ueber einem Naturboden. Verkehrsbedingte Bodenvibrationen und Schallpegel konnten innerhalb der Durchlaesse in ihrer Wirksamkeit aber eher vernachlaessigt werden. Durchlaesse waren hinsichtlich ihrer Lichtverhaeltnisse natuerlichen Tiergaengen vergleichbar und wurden bei grabfaehigem Untergrund auch als Tagesversteck genutzt. Mikroklimatisch fuehrten Durchlaesse von Amphibienschutzanlagen zu einer deutlichen Daempfung von Tagesschwankungen der bodennahen Lufttemperatur, Luftfeuchte und von boeigen Luftverwirbelungen, wie sie vor Leitanlagen und Durchlasseingaengen herrschen. Trotzdem erhoehten Luftbewegungen in den Tunneln die Wasserverdunstung bis zum Doppelten, aber ohne erkennbare negative Auswirkungen auf das Wanderverhalten der Amphibien. Die Tiere liefen vor den Durchlasseingaengen haeufig hin und her. Etwa 13 Prozent der beobachteten Tiere versuchte (erfolglos) durch Hochstellen und Klettern an Leitzaeunen und Sperrbrettern das Schutzanlagensystem zu umgehen. Die meisten Tiere hielten sich dicht an der Sperrwand, beziehungsweise unmittelbar vor den Durchlasseingaengen auf, waehrend nur ein geringer Anteil auch tatsaechlich hineinwanderte. An Durchlaessen mit einem Fallrohr und auch beim Versuchsaufbau mit einem Kombinationssystem aus 1- und 2-Wegedurchlass waren die Eintrittsquoten dagegen nahezu vollstaendig. Neben Amphibien wurden auch Tiere zahlreicher anderer Tiergruppen bei der Durchquerung der Kleintierdurchlaesse beobachtet. Anhand der Ergebnisse erscheint eine Ueberarbeitung des Merkblatts fuer Amphibien an Strassen (MAmS) sinnvoll. (A) Schlussbericht zum Forschungsprojekt FE 02.263/2005/LRB (ITRD D708058).

Una persona deve essere qualificata commerciante professionale di immobili al momento dellâ€™acquisto o a quello della vendita del bene?,"La Camera di diritto tributario del Tribunale dâ€™appello del Canton Ticino (di seguito â€œCameraâ€), in una sentenza del 19 ottobre 2010, Ã¨ tornata ad occuparsi della questione relativa alla delimitazione tra commercio professionale di immobili (imponibile ai sensi dellâ€™articolo 18 capoverso 1 LIFD quale reddito da attivitÃ  lucrativa indipendente) e mera amministrazione patrimoniale o occasione fortuita di transazione immobiliare (esente ai sensi dellâ€™articolo 16 capoverso 3 LIFD). Nel caso in questione il ricorrente impugnava la decisione dellâ€™autoritÃ  di tassazione, la quale assoggettava allâ€™imposta federale diretta il guadagno conseguito con la vendita di un immobile avvenuta nel 2005, il cui acquisto â€“ che consisteva in uno stabile di appartamenti â€“ risaliva al 2002 e che, in seguito, era stato trasformato in una proprietÃ  per piani nel 2005. Il ricorrente sosteneva che al momento dellâ€™acquisto non aveva previsto di vendere lâ€™immobile e per questa ragione chiedeva di considerare, quale valore dâ€™investimento, il valore venale dellâ€™immobile al momento della costituzione della proprietÃ  per piani, poichÃ© solo allora, infatti, avrebbe preso inizio lâ€™attivitÃ  commerciale. Di diverso avviso, invece, lâ€™autoritÃ  fiscale secondo cui, tra il momento dellâ€™acquisto dellâ€™immobile e quello in cui erano iniziate le vendite, era trascorso un troppo breve lasso di tempo per poter operare una rivalutazione del bene al presunto valore di mercato. (cfr. fatti iniziali da lett. A a lett. E) Ai fini dellâ€™imposta federale diretta sono imponibili tutti i proventi dallâ€™esercizio di unâ€™impresa commerciale, industriale, artigianale, agricola o forestale, da una libera professione e da ogni altra attivitÃ  lucrativa indipendente (articolo 18 capoverso 1 LIFD). Con una sentenza di principio del 1999, il Tribunale federale ha inoltre confermato lâ€™imponibilitÃ  degli utili provenienti dal commercio professionale di beni, in particolare immobili e titoli. Esenti risultano unicamente gli utili in capitale conseguiti nella realizzazione di sostanza privata (articolo 16 capoverso 3 LIFD). Lâ€™Alta Corte, in tale sentenza, ha a[ermato che gli utili provenienti da unâ€™attivitÃ  che oltrepassa la mera amministrazione della sostanza privata rappresentano un reddito da attivitÃ  lucrativa indipendente ed anche i beni impiegati per tale attivitÃ  costituiscono sostanza aziendale, anche se viene a mancare ogni attivitÃ  organizzata nella forma di una vera e propria impresa. Ne consegue che lâ€™esenzione (articolo 16 capoverso 3 LIFD) Ã¨ limitata a quegli utili in capitale che sorgono nel quadro della usuale amministrazione del patrimonio, cioÃ¨ senza una particolare attivitÃ  del contribuente indirizzata al conseguimento di un lucro, oppure in seguito ad unâ€™occasione che si o[re in modo casuale.

Two-part hidden Markov models for semicontinuous longitudinal data with nonignorable missing covariates.,"This study develops a two-part hidden Markov model (HMM) for analyzing semicontinuous longitudinal data in the presence of missing covariates. The proposed model manages a semicontinuous variable by splitting it into two random variables: a binary indicator for determining the occurrence of excess zeros at all occasions and a continuous random variable for examining its actual level. For the continuous longitudinal response, an HMM is proposed to describe the relationship between the observation and unobservable finite-state transition processes. The HMM consists of two major components. The first component is a transition model for investigating how potential covariates influence the probabilities of transitioning from one hidden state to another. The second component is a conditional regression model for examining the state-specific effects of covariates on the response. A shared random effect is introduced to each part of the model to accommodate possible unobservable heterogeneity among observation processes and the nonignorability of missing covariates. A Bayesian adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) procedure is developed to conduct simultaneous variable selection and estimation. The proposed methodology is applied to a study on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset. New insights into the pathology of Alzheimer's disease and its potential risk factors are obtained.",2020,Statistics in medicine
On the Algorithmic Power of Spiking Neural Networks,"Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) are mathematical models in neuroscience to describe the dynamics among a set of neurons which interact with each other by firing spike signals to each other. Interestingly, recent works observed that for an integrate-and-fire model, when configured appropriately (e.g., after the parameters are learned properly), the neurons' firing rate, i.e., converges to an optimal solution of Lasso and certain quadratic optimization problems. Thus, SNN can be viewed as a natural algorithm for solving such convex optimization problems. However, theoretical understanding of SNN algorithms remains limited. In particular, only the convergence result for the Lasso problem is known, but the bounds of the convergence rate remain unknown. Therefore, we do not know any explicit complexity bounds for SNN algorithms. 
In this work, we investigate the algorithmic power of the integrate-and-fire SNN model after the parameters are properly learned/configured. In particular, we explore what algorithms SNN can implement. We start by formulating a clean discrete-time SNN model to facilitate the algorithmic study. We consider two SNN dynamics and obtain the following results. 
* We first consider an arguably simplest SNN dynamics with a threshold spiking rule, which we call simple SNN. We show that simple SNN solves the least square problem for a matrix $A\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ and vector $\mathbf{b} \in \mathbb{R}^m$ with timestep complexity $O(\kappa n/\epsilon)$. 
* For the under-determined case, we observe that simple SNN may solve the $\ell_1$ minimization problem using an interesting primal-dual algorithm, which solves the dual problem by a gradient-based algorithm while updates the primal solution along the way. We analyze a variant dynamics and use simulation to serve as partial evidence to support the conjecture.",2019,

"Abstract: Calcareous paleosols as indicators of climato-eustatic change in the Late Carboniferous Sydney Coalfield, Nova Scotia","Three calcareous paleosolassociations are present a few metres to tens of metres below the Phalen, Backpit, Bouthillier, Bonar and Point Aconi Coals of the Sydney Coalfield: (a) Calcretes: zones about I m thick of carbonate-cemented sandstone with stratification strongly disrupted by roots or vadose diagenesis, overlain by a nodular, calcareous crust about 50 cm thick with a pronounced vertical fabric. (b) Red calcic vertisols: red mudstones up to 7 m thick, with dispersed carbonate nodules, weakly developed carbonate accumulation zones, concave up joints and slickensides. (c) Grey calcic vertisols: grey mudstones with features similar to those of (b). They contain nodular, bivalve bearing carbonate beds that formed by pedogenetic modification oflake deposits (palustrine carbonates). The calcareous paleosols can be traced for> 25 km and form part of cyclothems with a systematic stratal succession and mean duration of 200 ka. Grey detrital bay fills with hydromorphi~ paleosols and a restricted-marine biota are capped by one or more calcretes. The overlying alluvial strata contain red calcic vertisols. In the Glace Bay Syncline where groundwater levels were persistently high, grey calcic vertisols and palustrine carbonates are present at these horizons. The cyclothems terminate with further grey bayfills and thick, economic coals. The calcareous paleosols reflect a profound change in climate (semi-arid, strongly seasonal) at mid-cyclothem level from that indicated by coals and hydromorphic paleosols at the cyclothem base and top (humid, weakly seasonal). At least one calcareous paleosol formed on an interfluve between paleovalleys and reflects semi-arid pedogenesis during a glacioeustatic lowering of sea level.",1994,
Smart building uncertainty analysis via adaptive Lasso,"Uncertainty analysis plays a pivotal role in identifying the important parameters affecting building energy consumption and estimate their effects at the early design stages. In this work, we consider the adaptive Lasso for uncertainty analysis in building performance simulation. This procedure has several appealing features: (1) We can introduce a large number of possible physical and environmental parameters at the initial stage to obtain a more complete picture of the building energy consumption. (2) The procedure could automatically select parameters and estimate influences simultaneously and no prior knowledge is required. (3) Due to computational efficiency of the procedure, non-linear relationship between the building performance and the input parameters could be accommodated. (4) The proposed adaptive Lasso can use a small number of samples to achieve high modeling accuracy and further reduce the huge computational cost of running building energy simulation programs. Furthermore, we propose a stable algorithm to rank input parameters to better identify important input parameters that affect energy consumption. A case study shows the superior performance of the procedure compared with LS and OMP in terms of modeling accuracy and computational cost.",2017,IET Cyper-Phys. Syst.: Theory & Appl.
P124: Targeted bisulfite sequencing of potential prostate cancer cell-free DNA markers: novel approach to reveal diagnostically significant molecules,"Cancer cells display altered methylation signatures distinguishing them from normal cells. Originating from all tissues and cells of the body cell-free DNA (cfDNA) including aberrantly methylated DNA reflect epigenetic aberrations occurs not only in tumor cells but also in tumor microenvironment. Actually, aberrantly methylated cfDNA has proved to be a promising biomarker for noninvasive detection of cancer with several clinically-certified tests (Epi-pro ColonÂ®, Epi-pro LungÂ®, CologuardÂ®). However only one test (Epi-pro ColonÂ®) uses blood plasma â€“ the most convenient source of cfDNA. Input of tissue and age specific methylation along with unidentified reasons lead to the presence of molecules with every conceivable cytosine-methylation patterns which decrease probability of tumor DNA identification. Among numerous variants of cfDNA methylation patterns only few reflect cancer related changes. To identify those tumor-specific profiles single nucleotide resolution of methylated cytosine locations in the individual circulating DNA molecules is obviously required. We performed target bisulfite sequencing of potential prostate cancer (PC) cfDNA markers (GSTP1; RNF219) isolated from blood plasma of 18 healthy donors (HD), 17 benign hyperplasia (BPH) and 20 PC patients using MiSeq platform (Illumina). RNF219 gene was shown to have high diagnostic potential in our previous comparative study of cfDNA from HD, PC and BHP patients using HCGI12k microarrays (Cortese, et al., 2012). GSTP1 is a common pathological DNA methylation event in PC and is most widely studied and promising methylation marker in the cfDNA of PC patients (Wu, et al., 2011). Selected loci were amplified after bisulfite conversion (Zymo Research) of cfDNA with methyl-independent barcoded primers and sequenced with coverage ranging from 23509 to 143953. Identification of CpG methylation status in DNA fragments was performed with the BiQ Analyzer HT Software. All statistical analysis was performed using R Statistical Software (version 3.1.1) To reveal diagnostically significant differences, several approaches to data analysis were used. Conventional approach is a prediction of patientâ€™s diagnosis based on differences in methylation level of CpG-sites. Another approach used in this study relies on discrimination of cancer-related correlation between methylation statuses of CpG-sites within individual molecules of cfDNA â€“ Intramolecular Correlation of Methylation Statuses (ICoMS). Study population was randomly subsampled into training and test cohorts. The logit regression model based on methylation level of CpG-sites achieved an area under the ROC curve (AUC) exceeding 0.94 in both cohorts for GSTP1 gene and 0.81 â€“ for RNF219 gene. A novel approach to identify diagnostic significance of cfDNA methylation was based on comparison of correlation matrices (pairwise phi coefficient between methylation statuses of CpG sites) for HD, BHP and PC groups. Binomial regression models with LASSO penalization were used to predict patientâ€™s diagnosis. ROC curves for fitted models show AUC, specificity and sensitivity as 0.99, 100% and 92% for GSTP1 gene and 0.99, 100% and 90% for RNF219 (test cohort). The ICoMS approach estimates diagnostic value of target genes and reveals cancer-related cytosine methylation. That could potentially input in gene expression, identify the features of tumor physiology and on a par with conventional approaches provide helpful information for rational design of noninvasive, methylation-specific cfDNA-based diagnostics for PC. Moreover, the planned further evaluation of relationship between the revealed correlations associated with cancer and tumor biology could increase the basic knowledge of carcinogenesis.",2015,Ejc Supplements
The initial phase of the early Sarmatian ( Middle Miocene ) transgression . Foraminiferal and ostracod assemblages from an incised valley fill in the Molasse Basin of Lower Austria,"In order to document the foraminiferal and ostracod faunal changes between Badenian and Sarmatian strata, we investigated samples from a sediment core drilled at Hollabrunn in Lower Austria. Lower Badenian strata show typical normal marine, outer shelf to upper bathyal foraminferal and ostracod assemblages also known from other sections in the Molasse and Vienna Basins. The cooccurrence of Praeorbulina glomerosa circularis and Orbulina suturalis indicates a lower Badenian age for these samples, corresponding to the mid Langhian Zone M6. The investigated core lacks middle to upper Badenian strata. We were able to identify the Sarmatian samples by 1) index species and 2) by apparently unique autochthonous microfossil assemblages. We found the Sarmatian foraminiferal index species Nonion bogdanowiczi and Anomalinoides dividens in samples from the upper part of the core and did not find foraminifers or ostracods belonging to lower Sarmatian Elphidium reginum Zone or younger (eco-) Zones. Consequently, the drilled Sarmatian samples belong to the basal Sarmatian Anomalinoides dividens (eco-) Zone. The monospecific occurrence of Aubignyna perlucida in one older sample, however, suggests an extreme, most likely brackish environment with very different conditions from those prevailing earlier during the Badenian. Although no foraminiferal index species were found in the sample, we correlate this ecostratigraphic event with the basal Sarmatian transgression. Ilyocyrididae, Candonidae and Darwinulidae in younger but still basal Sarmatian samples indicate fresh to oligohaline waters and point to increased terrestrial influences. The inferred depositional history fits well with the idea of a Sarmatian incised valley fill within Badenian sediments. Presence of uncommon ostracods (Nipponocythere karsyensis) may point to intensive faunal exchange with the Carpathian Foredeep during the early Badenian. Um FaunenverÃ¤nderungen bei Foraminiferen und Ostrakoden zwischen badenischen und sarmatischen Schichten zu dokumentieren, wurden von uns Proben eines Sedimentkerns aus Hollabrunn in NiederÃ¶sterreich untersucht. Unterbadenische Schichten zeigen typische normalmarine Foraminiferenund Ostrakodenassoziationen des Ã¤uÃŸeren Schelfs bis oberen Bathyals, die auch aus anderen Profilen des Molassebeckens und des Wiener Beckens bekannt sind. Das gemeinsame Vorkommen von Praeorbulina glomerosa circularis und Orbulina suturalis zeigt das unterbadenische Alter dieser Proben an, das der Zone M6 des mittleren Langhiums entspricht. Der untersuchte Kern enthielt keine mittelbis oberbadenischen Ablagerungen. Die sarmatischen Alter konnten 1) durch Index-Arten und 2) durch offensichtlich einzigartige autochthone Mikrofossilassoziationen identifiziert werden. Im oberen Teil des Kerns konnten die sarmatischen Foraminiferenindexarten Nonion bogdanowiczi und Anomalinoides dividens gefunden werden, jedoch keinerlei Foraminiferen oder Ostrakoden, die der untersarmatischen Elphidium reginum-Zone oder jÃ¼ngeren Ã–kozonen zugeordnet werden kÃ¶nnen. Daraus folgt, dass die erbohrten sarmatischen Proben der basalen Anomalinoides dividens (Ã–ko-) Zone angehÃ¶ren. Das monospezifische Auftreten von Aubignyna perlucida in einer Ã¤lteren Probe weiÃŸt auf einen extremen, hÃ¶chstwahrscheinlich brackischen Lebensraum hin, in dem Umweltbedingungen herrschten, die von denen im Badenium sehr verschieden waren. Obwohl in dieser Probe keine Index-Arten gefunden wurden, wird dieses Ã¶kostratigraphische Ereignis von uns mit der Transgression im basalen Sarmatium korreliert. Ilyocyrididae, Candonidae und Darwinulidae in jÃ¼ngeren aber noch immer basalsarmatischen Proben zeigen SÃ¼sswasser oder oligohaline VerhÃ¤ltnisse an und verweisen auf zunehmende terrestrische EinflÃ¼sse. Die sich hieraus ergebende Ablagerungsgeschichte passt gut mit der Vorstellung der sarmatischen VerfÃ¼llung eines in badenische Sedimente eingeschnittenen Tals zusammen. Das Vorkommen ungewÃ¶hnlicher Ostracodenarten (Nipponocythere karsyensis) deutet auf einen intensiven Faunenaustausch mit der karpatischen Vortiefe wÃ¤hrend des frÃ¼hen Badeniums hin. _____ _____________________",2009,

QTL for magnitude of the plasma cortisol response to confinement in rainbow trout,"Better understanding of the mechanisms underlying i nter-individual variation in stress responses and their links with production traits is a key issue for sustainable animal breeding. In this study, we searched for QTL controlling the magnitude of the plasma cortisol stress response and compared them to body size traits in f ive F2 full-sib families issued from two rainbow trout lines divergently selected for high o r low postconfinement plasma cortisol level. Approximately 1000 F2 individuals were indiv i ually tagged and exposed to two successive acute confinement challenges (one month interval). Post-stress plasma cortisol concentrations were determined for each fish. A med ium density genome scan was carried out (268 markers, overall marker spacing less than 10cM ). QTL detection was performed using QTLMap software, based on an interval mapping metho d ( ttp://www.inra.fr/qtlmap). Overall, QTL of medium individual effects on cortis ol responsiveness (<10% of phenotypic variance) were detected on nineteen chromosomes, st rongly supporting the hypothesis that control of the trait is polygenic. While a core arr ay of QTL controlled cortisol concentrations at both challenges, several QTL seemed challenge sp ecific, suggesting that responses to the first and to a subsequent exposure to the confineme t stressor are distinct traits sharing only part of their genetic control. Chromosomal location of the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) makes it a good potential candidate gene for one of the QTL. Finally, comparison of body size traits QTL (weight, length and body confirmation) with cortisolassociated QTL did not support evidence for negativ e genetic relationships between the two types of traits.",2014,
Neighborhood Properties Are Important Determinants of Temperature Sensitive Mutations,"Temperature-sensitive (TS) mutants are powerful tools to study gene function in vivo. These mutants exhibit wild-type activity at permissive temperatures and reduced activity at restrictive temperatures. Although random mutagenesis can be used to generate TS mutants, the procedure is laborious and unfeasible in multicellular organisms. Further, the underlying molecular mechanisms of the TS phenotype are poorly understood. To elucidate TS mechanisms, we used a machine learning method-logistic regression-to investigate a large number of sequence and structure features. We developed and tested 133 features, describing properties of either the mutation site or the mutation site neighborhood. We defined three types of neighborhood using sequence distance, Euclidean distance, and topological distance. We discovered that neighborhood features outperformed mutation site features in predicting TS mutations. The most predictive features suggest that TS mutations tend to occur at buried and rigid residues, and are located at conserved protein domains. The environment of a buried residue often determines the overall structural stability of a protein, thus may lead to reversible activity change upon temperature switch. We developed TS prediction models based on logistic regression and the Lasso regularized procedure. Through a ten-fold cross-validation, we obtained the area under the curve of 0.91 for the model using both sequence and structure features. Testing on independent datasets suggested that the model predicted TS mutations with a 50% precision. In summary, our study elucidated the molecular basis of TS mutants and suggested the importance of neighborhood properties in determining TS mutations. We further developed models to predict TS mutations derived from single amino acid substitutions. In this way, TS mutants can be efficiently obtained through experimentally introducing the predicted mutations.",2011,PLoS ONE
The search for genes associated to disease: The LASSO method and the case of Bone Mineral Density,"Bone Mineral Density (BMD) tells us about the amount of minerals in bones, and gives an indication of bones strength. The BMD is influenced by genetic factors as well as nutrition, sex hormone status, glucocorticoid therapy and physical activity among others. In this project we have focused on genes making an impact on BMD, by using mathematics and regression. Since the number of explanatory variables x (genes) overrides the number of response variables y (women) we use the variable selection method called LASSO. In that way we are able to sort out the genes with the highest contribution to BMD. We discovered 55 unique genes, among which ATP5SL, TNXA /// TNXB, SOST, PBXIP1, SNCA, GTF2F2, DPP8, C4orf31, TFDP2 and MCF2L were among those with the strongest association to BMD. SOST, AFFX-M27830 M at, PBXIP1 and RNF216 found by LASSO, confirms previous literature. Most of the genes seems to be highly associated with and probably have some impact on BMD.",2015,

The 2016 US Presidential Election and Its Chinese Audience,"Motivated by the question of how the public in an authoritarian political environment may perceive democratic elections, we analyze the underlying interests and sentiments of the Chinese audience regarding the 2016 US Presidential Election with the social media data collected from a large Chinese online community. We extract several latent topics of interest to the community from the text corpus by applying the unsupervised learning method of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and explore the amount of interests received by each topic by applying the supervised learning methods, including the Bayesian Additive Regression Trees and the Bayesian LASSO model. Results reveal much more attentions paid by the audience to the sensational news, especially the controversies related to Hillary Clintonâ€™s email leakage and Donald Trumpâ€™s anti-political-correctness and anti-globalization remarks, than to the substantive issues, e.g., regarding the candidatesâ€™ policy agendas or the democratic process.",2017,

An introduction to analytical mechanics,"The present edition of this compendium is intended to be a complement to the textbook â€œEngineering Mechanicsâ€ by J.L. Meriam and L.G. Kraige (MK) for the course â€Mekanik F del 2â€ given in the ï¬rst year of the Engineering physics (Teknisk fysik) programme at Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg. 
 
Apart from what is contained in MK, this course also encompasses an elementary understanding of analytical mechanics, especially the Lagrangian formulation. In order not to be too narrow, this text contains not only what is taught in the course, but tries to give a somewhat more general overview of the subject of analytical mechanics. The intention is that an interested student should be able to read additional material that may be useful in more advanced courses or simply interesting by itself. 
 
The chapter on the Hamiltonian formulation is strongly recommended for the student who wants a deeper theoretical understanding of the sub ject and is very relevant for the connection between classical mechanics (â€classicalâ€ here denoting both Newtonâ€™s and Einsteinâ€™s theories) and quantum mechanics. 
 
The mathematical rigour is kept at a minimum, hopefully for the beneï¬t of physical understanding and clarity. Notation is not always consistent with MK; in the cases it differs 
our notation mostly conforms with generally accepted conventions. 
 
The text is organised as follows: In Chapter 1 a background is given. Chapters 2, 3 and 4 contain the general setup needed for the Lagrangian formalism. In Chapter 5 Lagrangeâ€™s equation are derived and Chapter 6 gives their interpretation in terms of an action. Chapters 7 and 8 contain further developments of analytical mechanics, namely the Hamiltonian formulation and a Lagrangian treatment of constrained systems. Exercises are given at the end of each chapter. Finally, a translation table from English to Swedish of some terms used is found. 
 
Many of the exercise problems are borrowed from material by Ture Eriksson, Arne Kihlberg and Goran Niklasson. The selection of exercises has been focused on Chapter 5, which is of greatest use for practical applications.",2009,
Robustness Analysis of Visual QA Models by Basic Questions,"Visual Question Answering (VQA) models should have both high robustness and accuracy. Unfortunately, most of the current VQA research only focuses on accuracy because there is a lack of proper methods to measure the robustness of VQA models. There are two main modules in our algorithm. Given a natural language question about an image, the first module takes the question as input and then outputs the ranked basic questions, with similarity scores, of the main given question. The second module takes the main question, image and these basic questions as input and then outputs the text-based answer of the main question about the given image. We claim that a robust VQA model is one, whose performance is not changed much when related basic questions as also made available to it as input. We formulate the basic questions generation problem as a LASSO optimization, and also propose a large scale Basic Question Dataset (BQD) and Rscore (novel robustness measure), for analyzing the robustness of VQA models. We hope our BQD will be used as a benchmark for to evaluate the robustness of VQA models, so as to help the community build more robust and accurate VQA models.",2017,ArXiv
"The Noronha wrasse: a ""jack-of-all-trades"" follower","Following association between reef fishes involves opportunistic predators following one or more foraging nuclear species (mainly bottom-diggers). The followers benefit from food uncovered or flushed out when reef fishes disturb the bottom. At the Fernando de Noronha Archipelago, south-west Atlantic, we recorded the plankton eater, benthic invertebrate picker, and cleaner wrasse Thalassoma noronhanum, commonly known as the Noronha wrasse, acting as a very flexible feeder â€ a kind of â€œjack-of-all-tradesâ€ â€ while following reef fishes. The Noronha wrasse associated with 15 reef fish species, feeding on drifting particles made available as the latter foraged on the bottom. The wrasse displayed four types of feeding behaviour while following foraging reef fishes: 1) eating particles stirred up; 2) eating particles expelled by the foraging fish; 3) eating faecal particles; 4) cleaning fish. The wrasse was commonly recorded following the parrotfishes Sparisoma frondosum, S. axillare, S. amplum, and the grunt Haemulon parra. The variable feeding behaviour here recorded for T. noronhanum while following reef fishes seems rare among follower fish species. Nevertheless, some wrasse species have very opportunistic foraging habits as well, which render them likely candidates to display flexible feeding behaviour.

Selective inference with unknown variance via the square-root LASSO,"There has been much recent work on inference after model selection when the noise level is known, for example in forward stepwise model selection or LASSO with an independent estimate of $\sigma$. In this work we consider the more realistic scenario of an unknown noise level and propose using the square root LASSO (also known as the scaled LASSO) to conduct selective inference without previous knowledge of $\sigma$. Applying the selective inference framework described in Fithian et al. (2014), we construct selectively valid exact tests of parameters in the selected model. We discuss regression diagnostics including tests for inclusion of variables not selected by the square root LASSO. The selective inference framework also suggests a natural pseudo-likelihood estimate of the noise level that performs better than other estimates of $\sigma$ from the square root LASSO. Based on this estimate we use a Gaussian approximation to construct confidence intervals. We also consider exact inference when holding out some data for inference in the second stage, noting the same increase in power observed in Fithian et al. (2014). We illustrate our method on an HIV drug resistance dataset and in a multi-scale change point detection problem where the number of regressors is order $n^2$.",2015,arXiv: Statistics Theory
Energy efficiency maximization for heterogeneous networks: A joint linear precoder design and small-cell switching-off approach,"In this paper, we consider a multiuser multiple-input multipleoutput (MU-MIMO) heterogeneous network (HetNet) in which a macro base station (MBS) and multiple small-cells (SCs) coexist to serve multiple user terminals. We propose a joint linear precoder design problem to maximize the energy efficiency of the considered network. To tackle the cross-tier interference in the HetNets, we exploit zero-forcing precoding where the interference at the users is cancelled out by block diagonalization scheme. A novel group sparsity promoted as group Lasso is proposed using the weighted norm minimization, where the group sparsity pattern indicates those SCs that can be switched off and non-associated users. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms many existing algorithms in terms of the total energy efficiency in the HetNets.",2016,2016 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)
Google data in bridge equation models for German GDP,"There has been increased interest in the use of ""big data"" when it comes to forecasting macroeconomic time series such as private consumption or unemployment. However, applications on forecasting GDP are rather rare. In this paper we incorporate Google search data into a Bridge Equation Model, a version of which usually belongs to the suite of forecasting models at central banks. We show how to integrate these big data information, emphasizing the appeal of the underlying model in this respect. As the choice of which Google search terms to add to which equation is crucial - for the forecasting performance itself as well as for the economic consistency of the implied relationships - we compare different (ad-hoc, factor and shrinkage) approaches in terms of their pseudo-real time out-of-sample forecast performance for GDP, various GDP components and monthly activity indicators. We find that there are indeed sizeable gains possible from using Google search data, whereby partial least squares and LASSO appear most promising. Also, the forecast potential of Google search terms vis-avis survey indicators seems th have increased in recent years, suggesting that their scope in this field of application could increase in the future.",2019,International Journal of Forecasting
Evaluation of the factors that affect the lignin content in the reed canarygrass (Phalaris arundinacea L.) in Latvia,"In the production of granules from plants the cohesive substance lignin has a great importance, as it holds the granule together and does not allow it to disintegrate. The objective of this research was to evaluate the influencing factors of lignin content in reed canarygrass (Phalaris arundinacea L.) crop yield. In this research the varieties of reed canarygrass 'Marathon' and 'Bamse' were analysed for yields of first and second year. The lignin content of the samples was established by Classon's method. Arsenic (As), Cadmium (Cd), and Lead (Pb) and other chemical elements were established in the reed canarygrass samples with the spectrometer Optima 2100DV. The reed canarygrass second year crop yield was 3-4 times greater than the first year crop yield. A significantly correlation (p<0.05) was established in the first crop yield October samples between lignin and natrium (Na). Some correlation relationships are contradictory, which confirms that within the plant growth period the meteorological conditions are of great importance. Analysing the determining factors of lignin content it can be seen that they were influenced by the interaction of various factors - the sowing and growing period, the variety and the N-fertilizer rate application.",2011,
"Minimally Supervised Feature Selection for Classification (Master's Thesis, University Politehnica of Bucharest)","In the context of the highly increasing number of features that are available nowadays we design a robust and fast method for feature selection. The method tries to select the most representative features that are independent from each other, but are strong together. We propose an algorithm that requires very limited labeled data (as few as one labeled frame per class) and can accommodate as many unlabeled samples. We also present here the supervised approach from which we started. We compare our two formulations with established methods like AdaBoost, SVM, Lasso, Elastic Net and FoBa and show that our method is much faster and it has constant training time. Moreover, the unsupervised approach outperforms all the methods with which we compared and the difference might be quite prominent. The supervised approach is in most cases better than the other methods, especially when the number of training shots is very limited. All that the algorithm needs is to choose from a pool of positively correlated features. The methods are evaluated on the Youtube-Objects dataset of videos and on MNIST digits dataset, while at training time we also used features obtained on CIFAR10 dataset and others pre-trained on ImageNet dataset. Thereby, we also proved that transfer learning is useful, even though the datasets differ very much: from low-resolution centered images from 10 classes, to high-resolution images with objects from 1000 classes occurring in different regions of the images or to very difficult videos with very high intraclass variance. 7",2015,ArXiv

A framework to characterize performance of LASSO algorithms,"In this paper we consider solving \emph{noisy} under-determined systems of linear equations with sparse solutions. A noiseless equivalent attracted enormous attention in recent years, above all, due to work of \cite{CRT,CanRomTao06,DonohoPol} where it was shown in a statistical and large dimensional context that a sparse unknown vector (of sparsity proportional to the length of the vector) can be recovered from an under-determined system via a simple polynomial $\ell_1$-optimization algorithm. \cite{CanRomTao06} further established that even when the equations are \emph{noisy}, one can, through an SOCP noisy equivalent of $\ell_1$, obtain an approximate solution that is (in an $\ell_2$-norm sense) no further than a constant times the noise from the sparse unknown vector. In our recent works \cite{StojnicCSetam09,StojnicUpper10}, we created a powerful mechanism that helped us characterize exactly the performance of $\ell_1$ optimization in the noiseless case (as shown in \cite{StojnicEquiv10} and as it must be if the axioms of mathematics are well set, the results of \cite{StojnicCSetam09,StojnicUpper10} are in an absolute agreement with the corresponding exact ones from \cite{DonohoPol}). In this paper we design a mechanism, as powerful as those from \cite{StojnicCSetam09,StojnicUpper10}, that can handle the analysis of a LASSO type of algorithm (and many others) that can be (or typically are) used for ""solving"" noisy under-determined systems. Using the mechanism we then, in a statistical context, compute the exact worst-case $\ell_2$ norm distance between the unknown sparse vector and the approximate one obtained through such a LASSO. The obtained results match the corresponding exact ones obtained in \cite{BayMon10,DonMalMon10}. Moreover, as a by-product of our analysis framework we recognize existence of an SOCP type of algorithm that achieves the same performance.",2013,ArXiv
Predicting occurrence rate of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ( SLE ) and Rheumatoid Arthritis ( RA ) in pregnant women,"Years ago, doctors advised women with autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) not to become pregnant for fear of maternal health. Now, it is known that healthy pregnancy is possible for women with lupus but at the expense of higher pregnancy complication rate. The main objective of this research is to identify key factors contributing to these diseases and to predict the occurrence rate of SLE and RA in pregnant women. Based on the approach used in this study, prediction of adverse pregnancy outcomes for women with SLE, RA and other diseases such as DM (Diabetes Mellitus) and APS (Anti-Phospholipid Antibody Syndrome) can be carried out. These results will help pregnant women to undergo healthy pregnancy by proper medication at an earlier stage. The data set was obtained from Cerner Health Facts data warehouse. The raw data set contains 883,473 records and 85 variables such as diagnosis code, age, race, procedure code, admission date, discharge date, total charges etc. Analyses were carried out with two different datasets, one for SLE patients and the other for RA patients. The final datasets had 397,898 and 398,742 records each for modeling RA and SLE patients respectively. To provide an honest assessment of models, the data was split into training and validation using data partition node. Variable selection techniques such as LASSO, LARS, Stepwise Regression, and Forward Regression were used. Using decision tree, prominent factors that determines the SLE and RA occurrence rate were identified separately. Of all the predictive models run using SASÂ® Enterprise MinerTM 12.3, the model comparison node identified Decision tree (Gini) as the best model with the least misclassification rate of 0.308 to predict the SLE patients and 0.288 to predict the RA patients.",2016,
A quantitative model based on clinically relevant MRI features differentiates lower grade gliomas and glioblastoma,"To establish a quantitative MR model that uses clinically relevant features of tumor location and tumor volume to differentiate lower grade glioma (LRGG, grades II and III) and glioblastoma (GBM, grade IV). We extracted tumor location and tumor volume (enhancing tumor, non-enhancing tumor, peritumor edema) features from 229 The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-LGG and TCGA-GBM cases. Through two sampling strategies, i.e., institution-based sampling and repeat random sampling (10 times, 70% training set vs 30% validation set), LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) regression and nineâ€“machine learning methodâ€“based models were established and evaluated. Principal component analysis of 229 TCGA-LGG and TCGA-GBM cases suggested that the LRGG and GBM cases could be differentiated by extracted features. For nine machine learning methods, stack modeling and support vector machine achieved the highest performance (institution-based sampling validation set, AUC >â€‰0.900, classifier accuracy >â€‰0.790; repeat random sampling, average validation set AUC >â€‰0.930, classifier accuracy >â€‰0.850). For the LASSO method, regression model based on tumor frontal lobe percentage and enhancing and non-enhancing tumor volume achieved the highest performance (institution-based sampling validation set, AUC 0.909, classifier accuracy 0.830). The formula for the best performance of the LASSO model was established. Computer-generated, clinically meaningful MRI features of tumor location and component volumes resulted in models with high performance (validation set AUC >â€‰0.900, classifier accuracy >â€‰0.790) to differentiate lower grade glioma and glioblastoma. â€¢ Lower grade glioma and glioblastoma have significant different location and component volume distributions. â€¢ We built machine learning prediction models that could help accurately differentiate lower grade gliomas and GBM cases. We introduced a fast evaluation model for possible clinical differentiation and further analysis.",2020,European Radiology
Genomic selection for quantitative adult plant stem rust resistance in wheat,"Quantitative adult plant resistance (APR) to stem rust (Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici) is an important breeding target in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and a potential target for genomic selection (GS). To evaluate the relative importance of known APR loci in applying GS, we characterized a set of CIMMYT germplasm at important APR loci and on a genome-wide profile using genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS). Using this germplasm, we describe the genetic architecture and evaluate prediction models for APR using data from the international Ug99 stem rust screening nurseries. Prediction models incorporating markers linked to important APR loci and seedling phenotype scores as fixed effects were evaluated along with the classic prediction models: Multiple linear regression (MLR), Genomic best linear unbiased prediction (G-BLUP), Bayesian Lasso (BL), and Bayes Cp (BCp). We found the Sr2 region to play an important role in APR in this germplasm. A model using Sr2 linked markers as fixed effects in G-BLUP was more accurate than MLR with Sr2 linked markers (p-value = 0.12), and ordinary G-BLUP (p-value = 0.15). Incorporating seedling phenotype information as fixed effects in G-BLUP did not consistently increase accuracy. Overall, levels of prediction accuracy found in this study indicate that GS can be effectively applied to improve stem rust APR in this germplasm, and if genotypes at Sr2 linked markers are available, modeling these genotypes as fixed effects could lead to better predictions.",2014,The Plant Genome
A Hierarchical Bayesian Framework for Constructing Sparsity-inducing Priors,"Variable selection techniques have become increasingly popular amongst statisticians due to an increased number of regression and classification applications involving high-dimensional data where we expect some predictors to be unimportant. In this context, Bayesian variable selection techniques involving Markov chain Monte Carlo exploration of the posterior distribution over models can be prohibitively computationally expensive and so there has been attention paid to quasi-Bayesian approaches such as maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation using priors that induce sparsity in such estimates. We focus on this latter approach, expanding on the hierarchies proposed to date to provide a Bayesian interpretation and generalization of state-of-the-art penalized optimization approaches and providing simultaneously a natural way to include prior information about parameters within this framework. We give examples of how to use this hierarchy to compute MAP estimates for linear and logistic regression as well as sparse precision-matrix estimates in Gaussian graphical models. In addition, an adaptive group lasso method is derived using the framework.",2010,arXiv: Methodology
Genome-wide association analysis by lasso penalized logistic regression,"MOTIVATION
In ordinary regression, imposition of a lasso penalty makes continuous model selection straightforward. Lasso penalized regression is particularly advantageous when the number of predictors far exceeds the number of observations.


METHOD
The present article evaluates the performance of lasso penalized logistic regression in case-control disease gene mapping with a large number of SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) predictors. The strength of the lasso penalty can be tuned to select a predetermined number of the most relevant SNPs and other predictors. For a given value of the tuning constant, the penalized likelihood is quickly maximized by cyclic coordinate ascent. Once the most potent marginal predictors are identified, their two-way and higher order interactions can also be examined by lasso penalized logistic regression.


RESULTS
This strategy is tested on both simulated and real data. Our findings on coeliac disease replicate the previous SNP results and shed light on possible interactions among the SNPs.

"Ecological traits of Mediterranean tree species as a basis for modelling forest dynamics in the Taurus mountains, Turkey","To investigate the past forestâ€“society interactions in the territory of the ancient city of Sagalassos, situated in the Taurus Mountains in Southwest Turkey, it is necessary to reconstruct forest composition and biomass through time. This paper focuses on modelling the natural vegetation dynamics in the area over the occurring gradient of biophysical site conditions under today's climate, as a first and essential stepping-stone towards this goal. GREFOS, a forest gap dynamics model developed for the North-Eastern Mediterranean Basin, was adapted to the bioclimatic conditions of the Taurus Mountains, adding effects of late frost on species regeneration and adjusting the fire module. The model was parameterized based on an extensive literature review and additional field measurements for the seven most important tree species in the study area (Pinus brutia, Pinus nigra, Cedrus libani, Abies cilicica, Quercus cerris, Quercus coccifera and Juniperus excelsa) resulting in the most complete and documented ecological traits matrix presently available for the studied species. Qualitative and semi-quantitative model validation indicates that simulated species presence, altitude ranges and basal area estimates correspond reasonably well to field observations or expected values based on literature and expert knowledge. Yet validation results also indicate some inaccuracies for simulation of P. nigra and J. excelsa at higher altitudes. Simulations are summarized in a conceptual model with four vegetation zones, which reflects literature and expert opinion, and is interpretable in terms of ecological processes and succession dynamics in the study area. It is concluded that the resulting model is able to realistically predict effects of fire and abiotic site conditions on natural vegetation development in different climate zones in the Taurus mountains. Further model development steps should aim to include important additional drivers of vegetation composition, such as climate change and land use.",2014,Ecological Modelling
"Title: "" an Efficient Genome-wide Multilocus Epistasis Search ""","High-throughput laboratory techniques are producing vast amount of genomic marker data â€“ discrete predictors to association studies. Linear regression model is often considered to link study phenotypes and these marker measurements to each other. Number of predictors in multi-marker regression models can easily be much larger than number of observations. Therefore, one needs application of variable selection to find small subset of important predictors out of large number of candidates. Such models can occasionally include also all pairwise locus-by-locus (epistasis) interactions which increases dimensionality of the model very rapidly. We consider variable selection problem of linear model containing large amount of predictors and all of their pairwise interactions in the model jointly. Our suggested approach (KÃ¤rkkÃ¤inen et al. 2015) use sureindependence-screening to first drop dimension of the problem by considering marginal importance of each interaction term within the huge loop. Subsequent estimation step then consider Bayesian variable selection approach (Extended Bayesian LASSO â€“ Mutshinda and SillanpÃ¤Ã¤ 2010). We also show that it is important to separate search of main and interaction effects in the algorithm to control number of false positives. Examples illustrates superior performance of our method over PLINK in terms of computation time and empirical power. Our successful examples consider even problem of originally of order of 280,000,000 interactions within a reasonable time frame.

Measuring child mortality from maternity histories collected at time of childbirth. Case of the EMIS surveys.,"
 A researcher has developed a new research methodology to indirectly estimate infant mortality using data from conditional samples which usually are from hospitals or health centers. This methodology is different from other similar methodologies in that it groups mothers by parity instead of age or marital duration. Parity is used since it is more likely to be accurately mortality levels by the mean length of the birth interval. Mortality patterns are not sensitive to the length of the birth interval. He uses data from the 1983 EMIS follow up survey conducted in Bobodioulasso, Burkina Faso and 1919, 1924, and 1933 data from birth registration areas in the United States to demonstrate the new methodology. The methodology shows that the estimated infant mortality rate (IMR) remained basically the same between 1968-1974 in Bobodioulasso (199-122) and began to fall in 1975. By 1983, it had fallen to 88. These results reflect the estimate from the EMIS survey. The methodology demonstrates that, in the US, estimated trends in IMR agreed with observed IMRs. The new methodology derived IMRs fell in the US between 1919-1932 from 92.8-65.5. Since maternity clinics and hospitals in many Sub-Saharan African countries maintain records with answers to routine questions, the new methodology can analyze these data to determine infant mortality trends. Yet conditional samples are not necessarily representative of the whole population. Thus researchers could apply data from unconditional samples such as those from the World Fertility Survey and the Demographic and Health Surveys to a variety of indirect estimation methods discussed in this report to complement the estimated trends of the conditional samples.

Weighted Lasso with Data Integration,"The lasso is one of the most commonly used methods for high-dimensional regression, but can be unstable and lacks satisfactory asymptotic properties for variable selection. We propose to use weighted lasso with integrated relevant external information on the covariates to guide the selection towards more stable results. Weighting the penalties with external information gives each regression coefficient a covariate specific amount of penalization and can improve upon standard methods that do not use such information by borrowing knowledge from the external material. The method is applied to two cancer data sets, with gene expressions as covariates. We find interesting gene signatures, which we are able to validate. We discuss various ideas on how the weights should be defined and illustrate how different types of investigations can utilize our method exploiting different sources of external data. Through simulations, we show that our method outperforms the lasso and the adaptive lasso when the external information is from relevant to partly relevant, in terms of both variable selection and prediction.",2011,Statistical Applications in Genetics and Molecular Biology
Near-ideal behavior of some compressed sensing algorithms,"A well-known result of CandeÌ€s and Tao [1] states the following: Suppose x âˆˆ â„<sup>n</sup> and has at most k nonzero components, but the location of the nonzero components is not known. Suppose A is an m Ã— n matrix that satisfies the so-called Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) of order 2k with a coefficient Î´<sub>2k</sub> <; âˆš2 - 1. Then one can recover x exactly by minimizing âˆ¥zâˆ¥<sub>1</sub> subject to Az = y = Ax. A later paper by CandeÌ€s [2] - see also [3] - studies the case of noisy measurements with y = Az + Î· where âˆ¥Î·âˆ¥<sub>2</sub> â‰¤ Îµ, and shows that minimizing âˆ¥zâˆ¥<sub>1</sub> subject to âˆ¥y - Azâˆ¥<sub>2</sub> â‰¤ Îµ leads to an estimate xÌ‚ whose error âˆ¥xÌ‚ - xâˆ¥<sub>2</sub> is bounded by a universal constant times the error achieved by an â€œoracleâ€ that knows the location of the nonzero components of x. This is called â€œnear ideal behaviorâ€ in [4], where a closely related problem is studied. The minimization of the â„“<sub>1</sub>-norm is closely related to the LASSO algorithm, which in turn is a special case of the Sparse Group LASSO (SGL) algorithm. In this paper, it is shown that both SGL, and an important special case of SGL introduced here called Modified Elastic Net (MEN), exhibit near ideal behavior.",2014,2014 European Control Conference (ECC)
Clustered Fused Graphical Lasso,"Estimating the dynamic connectivity structure among a system of entities has garnered much attention in recent years. While usual methods are designed to take advantage of temporal consistency to overcome noise, they conï¬‚ict with the detectability of anomalies. We propose Clustered Fused Graphical Lasso (CFGL), a method using precomputed clustering information to improve the signal detectability as compared to typical Fused Graphical Lasso methods. We evaluate our method in both simulated and real-world datasets and conclude that, in many cases, CFGL can signiï¬cantly improve the sensitivity to signals without a signiï¬cant negative effect on the temporal consistency.",2018,

Ranking Edges and Model Selection in High-Dimensional Graphs,"In this article we present an approach to rank edges in a network modeled through a Gaussian Graphical Model. We obtain a path of precision matrices such that, in each step of the procedure, an edge is added. We also guarantee that the matrices along the path are symmetric and positive definite. To select the edges, we estimate the covariates that have the largest absolute correlation with a node conditional to the set of edges estimated in previous iterations. Simulation studies show that the procedure is able to detect true edges until the sparsity level of the population network is recovered. Moreover, it can add efficiently true edges in the first iterations avoiding to enter false ones. We show that the top-rank edges are associated with the largest partial correlated variables. Finally, we compare the graph recovery performance with that of Glasso under different settings.",2015,

Radiomics signature of computed tomography imaging for prediction of survival and chemotherapeutic benefits in gastric cancer,"To develop and validate a radiomics signature for the prediction of gastric cancer (GC) survival and chemotherapeutic benefits. In this multicenter retrospective analysis, we analyzed the radiomics features of portal venous-phase computed tomography in 1591 consecutive patients. A radiomics signature was generated by using the Lasso-Cox regression model in 228 patients and validated in internal and external validation cohorts. Radiomics nomograms integrating the radiomics signature were constructed, demonstrating the incremental value of the radiomics signature to the traditional staging system for individualized survival estimation. The performance of the nomograms was assessed with respect to calibration, discrimination, and clinical usefulness. The radiomics signature consisted of 19 selected features and was significantly associated with DFS (disease-free survival) and OS (overall survival). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the radiomics signature was an independent prognostic factor. Incorporating the radiomics signature into the radiomics-based nomograms resulted in better performance for the estimation of DFS and OS than the clinicopathological nomograms and TNM staging system, with improved accuracy of the classification of survival outcomes. Further analysis showed that stage II and III patients with higher radiomics scores exhibited a favorable response to chemotherapy. In conclusion, the newly developed radiomics signature is a powerful predictor of DFS and OS, and it may predict which patients with stage II and III GC benefit from chemotherapy.",2018,EBioMedicine

Coincidences of composites of u.s.c. maps on h-spaces and applications,"Applications of the classical Knaster - Kuratowski - Mazurkiewicz (si- mply, KKM) theorem and the fixed point theory of multifunctions defined on convex subsets of topological vector spaces have been greatly improved by adopting the concept of convex spaces due to Lassonde [LIJ. In this direction, the first author [P5J found that certain coinciÂ­ dence theorems on a large class of composites of upper semicontinuous multifunctions imply many fundamental results in the KKM theory. On the other hand, the concept of convex spaces was extended by Horvath [HI-5J to spaces having certain families of contractible subsets or H -spaces.

the Arabidopsis lasso1 mutant links root gravitropic response and salt stress,"Plants display considerable developmental plasticity in response to changing environmental conditions. The adaptations of the root system to variations of growth conditions are an excellent model to study developmental plasticity. In an effort to identify mutants altered in root perception to salt stress, we screened an activation tagging collection (Weigel et al.2000) and identified the lasso1mutant that displays a strong agravitropic root growth on standard medium. Interestingly, the lasso1mutant phenotype is partially reverted by salt and osmotic stress (sorbitol) application. The aux1mutant, harboring a mutation in the auxin influx transporter AUX1 (Bennett et al.1996), displays a strikingly similar root agravitropic phenotype. We demonstrated that (i) lasso1is not allelic to aux1, (ii) theAUX1protein localization is not altered in lasso1,and (iii) neither salt nor osmotic stress alter aux1agravitropic root growth. We thus make the assumptionthat different molecular mechanisms are responsible for the phenotypic behavior of lasso1and aux1. Auxin transport is at the core of root gravitropic response, so we analyzed the perturbation of the auxin response marker DR5::GFP in the root tips of lasso1. Our results suggest a strong accumulation of auxin in the root columella and lateral root cap and we are now focusing on the auxin efflux transporters from the PIN family. Segregation studies have demonstrated that the lasso1 phenotype is independent of the activation tagging T-DNA and therefore the sequencing oflasso1genome is in progress to search for the origin of the mutation. This study will help us to identify new molecular mechanisms involved in the perception and integration by roots of their environment (gravity, salt, water).",2018,
Outcomes of the Equivalence of Adaptive Ridge with Least Absolute Shrinkage,"Adaptive Ridge is a special form of Ridge regression, balancing the quadratic penalization on each parameter of the model. It was shown to be equivalent to Lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator), in the sense that both procedures produce the same estimate. Lasso can thus be viewed as a particular quadratic penalizer. 
 
From this observation, we derive a fixed point algorithm to compute the Lasso solution. The analogy provides also a new hyper-parameter for tuning effectively the model complexity. We finally present a series of possible extensions of lasso performing sparse regression in kernel smoothing, additive modeling and neural net training.",1998,
A novel imputation method for missing values in air pollutant time series data,"Missing data is a widespread problem that studies in air quality have to deal with. The causes are varied, including sensor malfunctions and errors, power outages, computer system crashes, pollutant levels lower than detection limits, among others. Existing methods of data cleaning focus more on anomaly detection paying less attention to repairing them. Anomaly detection is a common approach used for filtering out dirty data. However, this approach could still result in unreliable data due to the incomplete data resulting from this process. This article presents an approach for repairing continuous sections of missing values in time series of air pollutant data. This study considers two regularized methods, Lasso and Ridge regression, to determine the number of data points forward and backward needed to estimate the value of a missing data point. Lasso presents superiority in front of Ridge regression to generate models for data imputation. The performance of the method was evaluated using the correlation coefficient (R2), the index agreement (d), the mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean square error (RMSE). The proposed imputation method exhibited good results in terms of accuracy and precision in gaps of different lengths. This study proved that the proposed imputation method is useful to impute accurately missing values in air pollution contaminant datasets, and it has the potential to be applied to any dataset configured as a time series.",2019,2019 IEEE Latin American Conference on Computational Intelligence (LA-CCI)
"Production and Optimization of Haloalkaliphilic Protease by an Extremophile -Halobacterium SP Js1, Isolated from Thalassohaline Environment","2 Abstract: An Extremely halophilic archaeon-Halobacterium sp JS1, isolated from solar salterns (Thalassohaline environment) was screened for the secretion of protease on casein plates containing 20% NaCl. Media and cultivation conditions were investigated to optimize bacterial growth and protease production which includes different Carbon and nitrogen sources, metal ions, in addition to different factors such as the incubation time, pH, temperature, NaCl concentrations and agitation levels. Optimum biomass and proteolytic activity was achieved after 96 hrs of incubation, at 40Â°C, pH-7.0 with 20% salinity and 200 rpm agitation. Among the various nitrogen sources investigated, defatted soybean meal was found to be the best inducer of alkaline protease, while inorganic nitrogen sources in the form of ammonium salts repressed bacterial growth and enzyme activity. Among the carbon sources tested, rice bran maximized the enzyme production. Combination of metal ions such as Ca, Mg and Mn enhanced proteolytic activity, where as Zn, Fe and CO strongly inhibited enzyme production.",2009,
"A clinical, proteomics, and artificial intelligenceâ€driven model to predict acute kidney injury in patients undergoing coronary angiography","BACKGROUND
Standard measures of kidney function are only modestly useful for accurate prediction of risk for acute kidney injury (AKI).


HYPOTHESIS
Clinical and biomarker data can predict AKI more accurately.


METHODS
Using Luminex xMAP technology, we measured 109 biomarkers in blood from 889 patients prior to undergoing coronary angiography. Procedural AKI was defined as an absolute increase in serum creatinine of â‰¥0.3 mg/dL, a percentage increase in serum creatinine of â‰¥50%, or a reduction in urine output (documented oliguria of <0.5 mL/kg per hour for >6 hours) within 7 days after contrast exposure. Clinical and biomarker predictors of AKI were identified using machine learning and a final prognostic model was developed with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO).


RESULTS
Forty-three (4.8%) patients developed procedural AKI. Six predictors were present in the final model: four (history of diabetes, blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio, C-reactive protein, and osteopontin) had a positive association with AKI risk, while two (CD5 antigen-like and Factor VII) had a negative association with AKI risk. The final model had a cross-validated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.79 for predicting procedural AKI, and an in-sample AUC of 0.82 (P < 0.001). The optimal score cutoff had 77% sensitivity, 75% specificity, and a negative predictive value of 98% for procedural AKI. An elevated score was predictive of procedural AKI in all subjects (odds ratio = 9.87; P < 0.001).


CONCLUSIONS
We describe a clinical and proteomics-supported biomarker model with high accuracy for predicting procedural AKI in patients undergoing coronary angiography.",2019,Clinical Cardiology

Studies on Weed Control with Herbicides in Soybean Field,"Tolerance test in plastic vat, pot and fold tests were carried out to investigate the selective herbicides for soybean culture in sandy loam. The soybean plants showed great tolerance against herbicides such as Tri-allate (Avadex-BW), Alachlor (Lasso), Butachlor (Machete), Propachlor (Ramrod), Nitrofen (TOK), MO, HE-314, Nitrofen/Dinoseb(TOK/DNBP), and Chlo.oxu.on (Tenoran), and the growth was normal even when each was treated with the herbicides up to 2ft3 times of the recommended concentrations. Soybean plants showed a slight tolerance against Prometryne (Gesagard), Propazine (Gegamil), Diuron (Karmex), Metabromuron (Patoran), Linuron (Lorox) and Swep when each was treated with herbicides up to 1-2 times of the recommended concentrations. Great injury or withering was noticed due to the high sensitivity of soybean to Simazine (CAT) and to Floumetron (Cotoran). In pot and field experiments with herbicides such as Butachlor (Machete), Alachlor (Lasso), Nitrofen (TOK), Kerb, Nitrofen/Dinoseb (TOK/DNBP), Swep, Linuron (Lorox), Simazine (CAT) and PCP, the following results were obtained: Great injuries were noticed with Simazine (CAT). Also, Linuron (Lorox) and Kerb showed a slight injury at early growth stage of soybean, Nitrofen (TOK) , Nitrofen/Dinoseb (TOK/DNEP), Alachlo. (Lasso), Butachlo. (Machete) and Swep had high selectivities for soybean and no injury was noticed. With respect to herbicidal effects there was a greatly significant difference between treated plots and non-treated plots with the exception of Simaaine (CAT) plot in field test.

Greenhouse effect and pressure patterns in the Mediterranean basin,"SummaryThe intensification of the greenhouse effect gives as a result the reduction of the Equator-Poles thermal gradient with which the movement towards North of the subtropical anticyclones, including the Azores one, could be associated. In the present work the trend of the surface atmospheric pressure is studied, using the historical series of Brera (Milan), Thalassographic Institute (Trieste) and Pennisi Collegium (Acireale) observatories, which start from the XIX century. In addition, also the geopotential field at 500 hPa in the Mediterranean is examined during the period 1946â€“1989: data indicate an increasing trend of the pressure on the Central-Western basin of the Mediterranean, with which the reduction of strong cyclogenetic events and an increase of blocking situations are connected.

Does renaming promote economic development? New evidence from a city-renaming reform experiment in China,"Abstract To explore the impact of city-renaming reform on economic growth, we compare the empirical performance of the synthetic control method, panel data approach and machine learning method (LASSO and elastic net) by the case of Xiangyang, which was officially renamed in 2010. We find that for the data on real GDP growth, the panel data approach reveals the best performance under the criteria of evaluating the quality of a model. The estimation results show that Xiangyang's real GDP growth rate rose by about 1.43% annually after the renaming reform. However, further discussions show that the annual growth rate of the tertiary industry decreased by 1.59%, which contradicts the mechanism of the brand effect of the reform. The statistical inference demonstrates that even if a city did not implement the city-renaming reform in 2010, the probability of obtaining an effect as large as Xiangyang's would be 25.9%. Therefore, the effect of the city-renaming reform is insignificant and other policy interventionsâ€”rather than the city-renaming reformâ€”promote economic growth in Xiangyang. In summary, policymakers cannot win a â€œPromotion Tournamentâ€ by renaming cities.",2019,China Economic Review
"Thalassospira povalilytica sp. nov., a polyvinyl-alcohol-degrading marine bacterium.","A polyvinyl-alcohol-degrading marine bacterium was isolated from plastic rope litter found in Tokyo Bay, Japan. The isolated strain, Zumi 95(T), was a Gram-reaction-negative, non-spore-forming and facultatively anaerobic chemo-organotroph. The major respiratory quinone was Q-10. The predominant fatty acids were C18â€Š:â€Š1Ï‰7c and C16â€Š:â€Š0. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, the isolated strain was closely affiliated with members of the genus Thalassospira in the class Alphaproteobacteria. The DNA G+C content of the novel strain was 55.1 mol%. The hybridization values for DNA-DNA relatedness between this strain and four reference strains representing species of the genus Thalassospira were significantly lower than that accepted as the phylogenetic definition of a species. On the basis of differences in taxonomic characteristics, the isolated strain represents a novel species of the genus Thalassospira for which the name Thalassospira povalilytica sp. nov.

Stochastic Zeroth-order Optimization in High Dimensions,"We consider the problem of optimizing a high-dimensional convex function using stochastic zeroth-order queries. Under sparsity assumptions on the gradients or function values, we present two algorithms: a successive component/feature selection algorithm and a noisy mirror descent algorithm using Lasso gradient estimates, and show that both algorithms have convergence rates that de- pend only logarithmically on the ambient dimension of the problem. Empirical results confirm our theoretical findings and show that the algorithms we design outperform classical zeroth-order optimization methods in the high-dimensional setting.",2018,

SUMMARY
The aim with this thesis has been to assess the association between the DDR1 gene and schizophrenia and the necessary tools to identify and score SNPs.
In the first study, a mutational screening of the coding and exon-intron sequences of DDR1 was performed in 100 samples of schizophrenic patients using the sequencing approach of pooled DNA. A total of 17 genetic variants were identified: 16 SNPs and a deletion of 2 bp.
In the second study, a population association and linkage disequilibrium (LD) analyses were carried out on 297 patients and 298 controls of Spanish origin for 5 SNPs within DDR1 region. Significant differences were observed between the haplotype distribution between patients and controls (p=0.002, 500 permutations, Phase). No significant differences were observed in allele and genotype frequencies between groups of study. In addition, pair-wise LD showed that all five SNPs were highly linked with D values higher than 0.8, except for the N502S variant in the patient group (D values ranging from 0.17 to 0.72). The potential for population stratification artifact was evaluted by genotyping a set of 25 unlinked markers. Formal testing showed that population structure did not explain the findings. Although no direct correlation was found between
the allelic combinations and schizophrenia, it can not be ruled out that other genetic variants in DDR1 or flanking regions could be involved in the disease.
In the third study, a new approach for multiplex SNP analysis combining the eTag System with the Invader(r) method was evaluated. A total of 10 SNPs were analyzed in 540 samples using both the eTag Multiplex Invader Assay and the conventional assay PCR-RFLP to measure genotyping accuracy and reproducibility. The typing concordance between both methods was 100%. This is the first study that demonstrates that the method eTag Multiplex Invader SNP Assay is a valid approach for SNP scoring.",2004,
A systematic review on model selection in high-dimensional regression,"Abstract High dimensional models are getting much attention from diverse research fields involving very many parameters with a moderate size of data. Model selection is an important issue in such a high dimensional data analysis. Recent literature on theoretical understanding of high dimensional models covers a wide range of penalized methods including LASSO and SCAD. This paper presents a systematic overview of the recent development in high dimensional statistical models. We provide a brief review on the recent development of theory, methods, and guideline on applications of several penalized methods. The review includes appropriate settings to be implemented and limitations along with potential solution for each of the reviewed method. In particular, we provide a systematic review of statistical theory of the high dimensional methods by considering a unified high-dimensional modeling framework together with high level conditions. This framework includes (generalized) linear regression and quantile regression as its special cases. We hope our review helps researchers in this field to have a better understanding of the area and provides useful information to future study.",2019,Journal of The Korean Statistical Society

Doubly Penalized Logistic Regression for Genomewide Association Studies with Linearly Structured Genetic Networks,"Title of thesis: DOUBLY PENALIZED LOGISTIC REGRESSION FOR GENOMEWIDE ASSOCIATION STUDIES WITH LINEARLY STRUCTURED GENETIC NETWORKS Xia Li, Master of Public Health, 2012 Directed by: Assistant Professor Tongtong Wu Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics This research aims to integrate linear structures of genetic networks into genomewide analysis studies (GWAS). Lasso penalized logistic regression is ideally suited for continuous model selection in case-control disease gene mapping, especially when the number of predictor variables far exceeds the number of observations. But it fails to consider the structure of genetic networks. Imposing an additional weighted fused lasso can further remove irrelevant predictors. Nesterovâ€™s method is employed to handle the high dimensionality and complexity of genetic data. It also resolves the non-differentiability problem of the lasso and fused lasso penalties. In simulation studies, this proposed method shows advantages in some cases compared with lasso and fused lasso. We apply this method to the coeliac data on chromosome 8.

GLM+: An Efficient System for Generalized Linear Models,"Generalized linear models are widely used in data analysis and machine learning, especially in large-scale machine learning because of its simplicity and good performance. Generalized linear models include regression, like linear regression, lasso and classification, support vector machine and logistic regression. We have some popular optimization methods to solve them, including stochastic gradient descent, coordinate descent and alternating direction method of multipliers. Commonly used systems for generalized linear model use a single optimization algorithm to solve all kinds of models. However, experiments show that it is impossible to achieve a cost-effective solution for all kinds of generalized linear models due to the differences between different models. In order to resolve the problem, we propose a rule-based optimization algorithm selector to select the best optimization algorithm automatically. In this paper, we first broadly review the three commonly used optimization methods, stochastic gradient, coordinate descent, alternating direction method of multipliers, perform some experiments, and then propose a rule-based optimizer to guide the solving. We also design a new system, GLM+, based on the three rules we proposed with the two engineering techniques, parameter selection and optimization for sparse data. We conduct some experiments on real datasets and compare it with the commonly used machine learning systems, Shotgun and scikit-learn, to verify the effectiveness of our system GLM+. The experiments demonstrate that GLM+ can be 3-10Ã—, sometimes 20Ã—, faster than existing popular systems for generalized linear models.",2018,2018 IEEE International Conference on Big Data and Smart Computing (BigComp)

To the chemist, thisintermetallic compound is unstable bydefinitionâ€”and not a â€œstable alloyâ€, asreported by Eichmillerâ€”and mercuryvapour leaks from dental amalgam overtime.Mercury adsorbed daily from dentalamalgam ranges from 2 to 17 g (notâ€œminuteâ€ amounts as Eichmillerclaims), and people that use chewinggum or are affected by bruxism mayhave higher intake of mercury fromdental amalgams. Moreover, individ-uals with dental amalgams are exposedto continuous long-term amounts ofmercury (in vapour form and inorganic form from biotransformationby oral bacteria). Mercury vapour andorganic mercury are the two mostimportant forms of mercury in terms oftoxic effects, their major target organbeing the central nervous system.Furthermore, T Clarkson",2002,The Lancet
Socioeconomic Diversity in Independent High Schools,"Author(s): Brody, Josh Ethan | Advisor(s): Wilms, Wellford W. | Abstract: ABSTRACT OF THE DISSERTATIONSocioeconomic Diversity in Independent High SchoolsbyJosh BrodyDoctor of EducationUniversity of California, Los Angeles, 2016Professor Wellford Wilms, ChairMost California independent schools are failing to meet the benchmark set by NationalAssociation of Independent Schools (NAIS) to enroll 20%-25% of their students on financial aid. The evidence is clear that many school leaders do not fully understand the impact of socioeconomic diversity on their studentsâ€™ experiences; thus, they cannot make the most informed decisions possible regarding their schoolâ€™s financial aid budgets, policies and programs. The purpose of this study was to explore the impact socioeconomic diversity has at independent secondary schools that exceed NAIS benchmarks. The study builds on research from higher education on the impact of racial and ethnic diversity on student learning outcomes. Through a qualitative comparative case study design, the researcher sought to answer the research questions of how socioeconomic diversity influences studentsâ€™ learning experiences; their civic, professional, and educational lives after high school; and the schoolsâ€™ policies and programs. To answer the research questions, the researcher interviewed students, alumni, teachers, and administrators at three schools in Los Angeles and San Francisco, using individual, face-to- face, semi-structured interviews. Themes from the interviews included that attending schools with socioeconomically diverse peers helped students gain comfort interacting with different people from different backgrounds, helped dispel negative stereotypes, and contributed to studentsâ€™ understanding of complexity and nuance in course content. The results indicate that diversity can enrich learning for all students, and that more school communities should create spaces and policies that support students and teachers exploration of different perspectives based on their social and cultural backgrounds.",2016,
Prediction magnetocrystalline anisotripy Fe-Rh thin films via machine leaning,"Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) was originally formulated for least squares models and this simple case reveals a substantial amount about the behavior of the estimator. It also shows that the coefficient estimates need not be unique if covariates are collinear. Using this Lasso technique, we analyze a magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy which is a long-standing issue in transition-metal thin films, expectially for Fe-Rh thin film systems on a MgO substrate. Our LASSO regression took advantage of the data obtained from first principles calculations for single slabs with seven atomic-layers of binary Fe-Rh films on MgO(001). In the case of Fe-Rh thin films, we have successfully found a linear behavior between the MCA energy and the anisotropy of orbital moments.",2019,arXiv: Materials Science

"The Great Land Rush and the Making of the Modern World, 1650-1900 (review)","nations and nature, but some Britons feared that excessive imperial extension would corrupt traditional culture at home. If Britons were somewhat wary about empire, John Crowley shows that they grew a voracious appetite for the empireâ€™s visual representation in the latter half of the eighteenth century. As travelers and military officers moved throughout the Atlantic, they painted topographic landscapes that attempted to lasso Britainâ€™s faraway lands into the imagined community of the Isles. Finally, Karin Wulf â€™s work on the genealogical diary of a Deborah Norris Logan, a Pennsylvania Quaker, demonstrates the continued importance of family lineage and transatlantic identities even after the Revolution. Loganâ€™s diary confirmed her familyâ€™s paternal treatment of slaves while simultaneously displaying its central role in the founding of Pennsylvania, the American Revolution, and the establishment of a new American nation. Wulf â€™s piece speaks to one womanâ€™s production of history, memory, and identity during a period of profound imperial, national, and personal crisis. This volume would be useful in a graduate seminar in early American history and indispensable in one on Atlantic history. Though there are a few very minor grammatical mistakes, the collection is generally well written and edited, and the index is unusually comprehensive for an edited volume (p. 316). The contributors and editors have done us a great service by bringing together in one volume some of the more creative and novel approaches to Atlantic history. As such, Atlantic history may yet serve as a panacea for the fragmentation and specialization that some historians frequently lament. edward e. andrews University of New Hampshire",2006,Journal of World History
"Timing of eclosion in marine insects on Mediterranean shores â€“ studies on Clunio mediterraneus, C. ponticus and Thalassomyia frauenfeldi (Diptera: Chironomidae)","Abstract In three Clunio stocks, two from the Mediterranean Sea (Banyuls, Rovinj) and one from the Black Sea (Sosopol), an identical circasemilunar eclosion pattern in combination with a circadian eclosion time of day was evoked in breeding experiments under an artificial moonlight cycle (four nights of 0.3 lux every 30 d, 12â€‰h light:12â€‰h dark). The eclosion peaks occurred on days with artificial moonlight and approximately 2â€‰weeks later, and with regard to the time of day between mid-night and lights-on. In spite of the weak tidal amplitudes on Mediterranean shores, extreme low water levels occur when a nocturnal low-water time coincides on days around full and new moon (spring-tide situation) with winds from land to sea. Field observations at Banyuls and Rovinj agree with the experimental results. In contrast to Clunio spp. adults (life span only a few hours), Thalassomyia frauenfeldi adults (life span up to several days in the laboratory) demonstrated an unsynchronized eclosion pattern in the experiments (no lunar concentration, wide diurnal eclosion gate). Although inhabiting the same intertidal area, T. frauenfeldi walking on exposed intertidal substrates can delay egg-deposition for days and can probably wait for favorable low water levels. The taxonomical status of European Clunio populations is reviewed; minute morphological distinctions are presented for C. mediterraneus in the otherwise morphologically uniform, but ecophysiologically differentiated genus.",1997,Marine Biology
Adaptive model selection in a high-dimension multiphase quantile regression,"We propose a general adaptive LASSO method for an high-dimension quantile regression, which is very interesting when we know nothing about the first two moments of the model error. We first propose that the obtained estimators satisfy the oracle properties, which involves the relevant variable selection without crossing through the hypothesis test. Next, we study the proposed method when the (multiphase) model changes to unknown observations called change-points. Convergence rates of the change-points and of the regression parameters estimators in each phase are found. The sparsity of the adaptive LASSO quantile estimators of the regression parameters is not affected by the change-points estimation. If the phases number is unknown, a consistent criterion is proposed. Numerical studies by Monte Carlo simulations show the performance of the proposed method, compared to other existing methods in the literature, in models with one or multi-phases.",2013,

SeleÃ§Ã£o genÃ´mica ampla para curvas de crescimento (Genome Wide Selection for growth curves),"A methodology was proposed for the genetic evaluation of growth curves considering SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) markers. At the first step, nonlinear regression growth models (Logistic) were fitted to the weight-age of each animal, and on second step the parameter estimates of the Logistic model were used as phenotype in a regression model (Bayesian LASSO - BL) which covariates were given by SNP genotypes. This approach allows the estimation of GBV (Genomic Breeding Values) for weight at either time of growth trajectory, allowing also the production of genomic growth curves, which selected groups of individuals with larger growth efficiency. The simulated data set was constituted of 2,000 individuals (being 1,000 in the training and 1,000 in the validation population) each one with 453 SNP markers distributed along 5 chromosomes. The results indicated high efficiency of the BL method to predict GBV in the validation population using information from the training population (correlation coefficients varying between 0.79 and 0.93). The BL also presented high efficiency to detect QTL, once the most expressive estimated SNP effects were located at positions closed to true QTL position fixed in the simulation.",2013,
Sparseness determination for boosting estimation of high-dimensional survival models,"There are several techniques for fitting sparse survival models to high-dimensional data, arising e.g. from microarrays. However, sparseness of the estimates, obtained e.g. with Lasso-like techniques, often comes at the cost of underestimating effects for the few covariates which have a large influence. This is especially problematic when clinical covariates are included in addition to a large number of microarray features. We address this issue in a new boosting approach, allowing for mandatory covariates, whose coefficients are estimated unpenalized [1]. However, when it is not known which covariates may potentially have a large effect, a different strategy is needed. The boosting procedure is therefore extended to automatically adapt the penalties used for estimation after every boosting step. Decreasing the penalty for a selected covariate will favor sparse models and avoid underestimation of effects. A scheme which increases the penalty will favor models with groups of important covariates. As it is difficult for the user to decide on a specific penalty updating scheme, we investigate whether the integrated Brier score, obtained via bootstrap .632+ prediction error curve estimates [3], could be used for automatic sparseness determination. The performance of the resulting procedure is compared to an alternative boosting strategy that employs two rounds of boosting, a first one where the important covariates are identified and a second one where these are then preferentially selected [2]. The advantages of our new boosting procedure will be illustrated using microarray survival data from patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.",2008,
Use of Functional Movement Screen Scores to Predict Dynamic Balance in Physically Active Men and Women.,"Scudamore, EM, Stevens, SL, Fuller, DK, Coons, JM, and Morgan, DW. Use of functional movement screen scores to predict dynamic balance in physically active men and women. J Strength Cond Res 33(7): 1848-1854, 2019-The primary focus of this study was to determine whether scores obtained from the Functional Movement Screen (FMS) can predict dynamic balance in young, healthy adults. Thirty-four physically active participants completed the FMS, and balance was assessed using measures of composite reach (CR) distance and overall stability indices (OSI) derived from Y Balance and Biodex Balance System testing, respectively. Results indicated that higher overall FMS scores were associated with better CR and OSI, and participants with FMS composite scores greater than 14 exhibited better CR compared to those with composite scores less than or equal to 14. In addition, lasso penalized regression demonstrated that (a) scores of 2 on the deep squat and 3 on the trunk stability push-up movements predicted a greater CR and (b) higher shoulder mobility scores and a rotary stability score of 3 predicted better OSI. We conclude that dynamic balance in young, active men and women can be predicted by specific FMS item scores.",2019,Journal of strength and conditioning research
Multi-element soil prospection aiding geophysical and archaeological survey on an archaeological site in suburban Sagalassos (SW-Turkey),"In order to take full advantage of the archaeological information contained within buried archaeological sites, it is important to apply an integrative approach combining complementary prospection methods. In this study, geochemical prospection data are combined with archaeological and geophysical survey results on an unexcavated site in suburban Sagalassos (SW-Turkey), with the aim of obtaining better insights into the structural shapes and past functionalities of the area. Spatial and multivariate statistical analyses of the chemical data reveal anomalies of K, P and Zn on a location where archaeological and geophysical results suggest the presence of ceramic producing kilns. These elemental enrichments are thought to result from burning wood or dung as fuel for the detected kilns. In addition, local anomalies of Co, Cr, Fe, Mg, Mn and Ni were found to reflect the working and storage of ophiolitic clays, employed as a raw material for ceramic production. Radiocarbon dating of charcoal in a 2.5Â m deep drill core in this zone provides ages between AD 120 and 350 at depths of 50 and 60Â cm. Al, As, Ba, Ca, Na, Sr, Ti and Pb are considered geogenic elements in this study. The present study supports the theory that geochemical prospection holds potential as a surveying technique, as it was found that chemical data facilitate the interpretation of structures detected by geophysical and archaeological methods, thereby creating an extra dimension to the interpretation of survey data. The results further argue in favour of using strong-acid extractions and the consideration of a large suite of elements when applying chemical soil survey as an archaeological prospection technique, and highlight the importance of considering site lithology. Multivariate statistics proved to be invaluable in distinguishing anthropogenic from lithological soil patterns.",2013,Journal of Archaeological Science
Multiwave analysis of high-mass star forming regions,"Ci sono stati notevoli sforzi per capire come si formano le stelle, sia da un punto di vista teorico che osservativo. Abbiamo raggiunto una buona comprensione di come si formano le stelle di bassa massa isolate (Klein et al. 2006). Lo scenario attualmente accettato e che le stelle di bassa massa si formano attraverso il collasso gravitazionale di un core prestellare; in seguito la formazione della sorgente prosegue con un accrescimanto dal disco che la circonda. 
Estendere questa teoria ad stelle di alta massa non e banale. Le protostelle di alta massa raggiungono la sequenza principale mentre sono ancora nella fase di accrescimento principale. Quando la protostella centrale raggiunge una massa di circa 10 masse solari si innesca la fusione dell'idrogeno nel nucleo della stella e la pressione di radiazione e il vento dovrebbero impedire un'ulteriore accrescimento.

A Typology Of Channel Islands Barbed Points,"Author(s): Glassow, Michael A.; Erlandson, Jon M.; Braje, Todd J. | Abstract: The Channel Islands Barbed point type occurs on the three larger northern Channel Islands off the coast of southern California. The points are small, unusually thin, and carefully knapped, and occur in archaeological assemblages dating between 12,100 and 7,800 cal B.P. Based on points of this type in museum collections compiled during the late nineteenth and early twentieth century and a lesser number from recent investigations, we present a typology of Channel Islands Barbed points consisting of seven subtypes, with the objective of facilitating investigation into their spatioÂ­temporal patterning. The delicate character of the points implies that the spears or darts on which they were hafted were used to acquire fauna in aquatic environments or were thrust rather than thrown, given that they would be highly vulnerable to breakage if thrown on land. Although having a very limited geographic distribution, the Channel Islands Barbed point type is comparable in quality of knapping to other Paleoindian and early Archaic types found elsewhere in North America.",2013,Journal of California and Great Basin Anthropology
"Ageing, Health, and Productivity: The Economics of Increased Life Expectancy","Increase in life expectancy is arguably the most remarkable by-product of modern economic growth. In the last 30 years we have gained roughly 2.5 years of longevity every decade, both in Europe and the United States. Successfully managing ageing and longevity over the next twenty years is one of the major structural challenges faced by policy makers in advanced economies, particularly in health spending, social security administration, and labour market institutions. This book looks closely into those challenges and identifies the fundamental issues at both the macroeconomic and microeconomic level. The first half of the book studies the macroeconomic relationships between health spending, technological progress in medical related sectors, economic growth, and welfare state reforms. In the popular press, longevity and population ageing are typically perceived as a tremendous burden. However, with a proper set of reforms, advanced economies have the option of transforming the enormous challenge posed by longevity into a long term opportunity to boost aggregate outcomes. The basic prerequisite of a healthy ageing scenario is a substantial structural reform in social security and in labour market institutions. The second part of the book looks closely into the microeconomic relationship between population ageing and productivity, both at the individual and at the firm level. There is surprisingly little research on such key questions. The book contributes to this debate in two ways. It presents a detailed analysis of the determinants of productivity, with a focus on both the long-run historical evolution and the cross sectional changes. It also uses econometric analysis to look into the determinants of the various dimensions of individual productivity. The volume concludes that the complex relationship between population ageing and longevity is not written in stone, and can be modified by properly designed choices.

Simultaneous sparse model selection and coefficient estimation for heavy-tailed autoregressive processes,"We propose a sparse coefficient estimation and automated model selection procedure for autoregressive (AR) processes with heavy-tailed innovations based on penalized conditional maximum likelihood. Under mild moment conditions on the innovation processes, the penalized conditional maximum likelihood estimator (PCMLE) satisfies a strong consistency, $O_P(N^{-1/2})$ consistency, and the oracle properties, where N is the sample size. We have the freedom in choosing penalty functions based on the weak conditions on them. Two penalty functions, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and smoothly clipped average deviation (SCAD), are compared. The proposed method provides a distribution-based penalized inference to AR models, which is especially useful when the other estimation methods fail or under perform for AR processes with heavy-tailed innovations (see \cite{Resnick}). A simulation study confirms our theoretical results. At the end, we apply our method to a historical price data of the US Industrial Production Index for consumer goods, and obtain very promising results.",2011,arXiv: Methodology
Christmas tree worms evade smothering by a coral-killing sponge in the Red Sea,"Some sponge species, such as Chalinula milnei (de Laubenfels, 1954) and Terpios hoshinota (Rutzler and Muzik, 1993), are known to encrust and smother large parts of stony corals, causing serious damage (Bryan 1973; Hoeksema et al. 2014). Little is known how these encrusters affect coralassociated fauna. During a biodiversity survey in the Red Sea near Thuwal, Saudi Arabia, a sponge resembling C. milnei was found overgrowing a massive coral (Porites lutea Milne Edwards and Haime, 1851) at 6 m depth on the offshore reef Bitlat Nazar (22Â°18â€²35â€²â€²N, 38Â°53â€²11â€²â€²E), 8 November 2014 (Fig. 1a). In the kill zone, the fringing part of the sponge overtopped the coral, while sand became trapped and accumulated in mucus (Fig. 1b). The same Porites coral acted as host for a serpulid polychaete, the Christmas tree worm Spirobranchus cruciger (Grube, 1862). These worms live inside a tube that is usually incorporated in the skeleton of the host coral (e.g. Hoeksema and ten Hove 2014). Two worms surrounded by the progressing sponge looked unharmed, exactly like the other individuals in their proximity (Fig. 1b). Both these worms seemed to live in association with the sponge now instead of with the coral (Fig. 1c), while they were actually still living inside the coral skeleton. Christmas tree worms use their operculum (Fig. 1c) to close their opening when retracted, but also as a shield when coming into contact with other animals (DeVantier et al. 1986). Frequent movements of the operculum may prevent the worms from becoming overgrown not only by aggressive sponges, but also by their host coral. Bryan (1973) noted that Bspirorbid^ worms residing on a Porites lutea coral in Guam were not encrusted by a Terpios sponge, possibly due to their movements. Such observations help to clarify the interactions between encrusting sponges and other benthic animals.",2015,Marine Biodiversity
The potential targets and mechanisms of a carbazole and pyrazole containing anticancer compound.,"AIMS
Characterization of a small anticancer compound.


BACKGROUND
The development of small molecules as new anti-cancer therapeutics is necessary to improve anti-tumor efficacy and reduce toxicities, especially for the treatment of brain tumors, where only small molecules can effectively cross the brain blood barrier. Several novel hits were previously selected by concurrently screening colon and glioma cancer cell lines with a sensor-conjugated reporter system. Here we focused on one of them.


OBJECTIVE
Elucidating the potential target(s) of a novel anticancer compound.


METHOD
Computer assisted structural and motif analysis (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator or LASSO score) was used to assess compound's targets, then direct kinase activity assays were used for the confirmation; Western blot of phosphorylated kinases, as well as FACS and caspase 3/7 activity assays, were used to decipher the action mechanisms. Finally, the expression profiling of proteins involved in various G-protein pathways by real-time PCR was performed.


RESULT
The small chemical, (4E)-4-[2-(9-ethyl-9H-carbazol-3-yl)hydrazin-1-ylidene]-3-methyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-5-one, with a formula C18H17N5O and MW of 319.36, designated as VUGX01, was predicted to be a ligand/inhibitor to receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) by computer analysis (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator or LASSO score). However, direct analysis with recombinant kinases showed it is not an effective inhibitor to the popular receptor kinases at 1ï­M concentration. This compound can activate caspases in some tumor cell lines, but has minimal effects on cell cycle. Drug treatments lead to the changes in phosphorylation of AKT and c-RAF, as well as the expression level of MAP2K, suggesting this compound may interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). The expression profiling of 82 proteins involved in various G-protein pathways by real-time PCR showed the treatment up-regulates the expression of several proteins, including angiotensinogen, angiotensin II receptor, and IP3-kinase catalytic subunit gamma.


CONCLUSION
VUGX01 can effectively block proliferation and induce apoptosis of certain type of cancer cells, even it's predicted by high LASSO score, but it is not an effective RTKs inhibitor, it may inhibit cell growth through acting as a novel ligand to one or several GPCRs.",2020,Current cancer drug targets
Regularized estimation of structural instability in factor models: The US macroeconomy and the Great Moderation,"This paper shows that the parsimoniously time-varying methodology of Callot and Kristensen (2015) can be applied to factor models. We apply this method to study macroeconomic instability in the US from 1959:1 to 2006:4 with a particular focus on the Great Moderation. Models with parsimoniously time-varying parameters are models with an unknown number of break points at unknown locations. The parameters are assumed to follow a random walk with a positive probability that an increment is exactly equal to zero so that the parameters do not vary at every point in time. The vector of increments, which is high dimensional by construction and sparse by assumption, is estimated using the Lasso. We apply this method to the estimation of static factor models and factor augmented autoregressions using a set of 190 quarterly observations of 144 US macroeconomic series from Stock and Watson (2009). We find that the parameters of both models exhibit a higher degree of instability in the period from 1970:1 to 1984:4 relative to the following 15 years. In our setting the Great Moderation appears as the gradual ending of a period of high structural instability that took place in the 1970s and early 1980s.",2015,
Sparse Multiple Kernel Learning: Support Identification via Mirror Stratifiability,"In statistical machine learning, kernel methods allow to consider infinite dimensional feature spaces with a computational cost that only depends on the number of observations. This is usually done by solving an optimization problem depending on a data fit term and a suitable regularizer. In this paper we consider feature maps which are the concatenation of a fixed, possibly large, set of simpler feature maps. The penalty is a sparsity inducing one, promoting solutions depending only on a small subset of the features. The group lasso problem is a special case of this more general setting. We show that one of the most popular optimization algorithms to solve the regularized objective function, the forward-backward splitting method, allows to perform feature selection in a stable manner. In particular, we prove that the set of relevant features is identified by the algorithm after a finite number of iterations if a suitable qualification condition holds. Our analysis rely on the notions of stratification and mirror stratifiability.",2018,2018 26th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)
Genotype prediction of ATRX mutation in lower-grade gliomas using an MRI radiomics signature,"ObjectivesTo predict ATRX mutation status in patients with lower-grade gliomas using radiomic analysis.MethodsCancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) patients with lower-grade gliomas were randomly allocated into training (n = 63) and validation (n = 32) sets. An independent external-validation set (n = 91) was built based on the Chinese Genome Atlas (CGGA) database. After feature extraction, an ATRX-related signature was constructed. Subsequently, the radiomic signature was combined with a support vector machine to predict ATRX mutation status in training, validation and external-validation sets. Predictive performance was assessed by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Correlations between the selected features were also evaluated.ResultsNine radiomic features were screened as an ATRX-associated radiomic signature of lower-grade gliomas based on the LASSO regression model. All nine radiomic features were texture-associated (e.g. sum average and variance). The predictive efficiencies measured by the area under the curve were 94.0 %, 92.5 % and 72.5 % in the training, validation and external-validation sets, respectively. The overall correlations between the nine radiomic features were low in both TCGA and CGGA databases.ConclusionsUsing radiomic analysis, we achieved efficient prediction of ATRX genotype in lower-grade gliomas, and our model was effective in two independent databases.Key Pointsâ€¢ ATRX in lower-grade gliomas could be predicted using radiomic analysis.â€¢ The LASSO regression algorithm and SVM performed well in radiomic analysis.â€¢ Nine radiomic features were screened as an ATRX-predictive radiomic signature.â€¢ The machine-learning model for ATRX-prediction was validated by an independent database.",2017,European Radiology
"Make(r) Space, Making Space: A Media Ecology in Two Parts","The pop-up maker space hosted by the Media Interventions working group of the Cultural Studies Association at the 2014 annual meeting, â€œEcologies: Relations of Culture, Matter, and Power,â€ is a collaborative intervention into the typical structure of academic conferences in the interdisciplinary humanities and social sciences, whose genres and formats tend to privilege established scholars, disciplinary paradigms, the new, and above all a mindset in which the resources attached to â€œprofessionalizationâ€ are governed by scarcity. Held concurrently with the main conference schedule at the University of Utahâ€™s historic Pierre Lassonde House, the maker space showcases the work of artists, activists, media practitioners, performers, researchers, and amateur â€œmakers,â€ inviting conference attendees to engage the material not merely as spectators but as active participants in the collective meanings of the event. In doing so, it quite literally makes space for multimodal methods of knowledge production that decenter the individual and scramble the dominant temporalities of academic labor. This two-part essay describes the maker space as media ecology in the process of unfolding across multiple time frames (and time zones) and through unevenly distributed agencies as well as affective states. The first part documents the process of making a space for making, while the second attempts to partially capture and re-present the event itself through digital photography, video clips, sound snippets, links, maps, and other media ancillary to the maker space. In reading, watching, listening, touching, clicking, and otherwise attending to what we are making, you become integrated into the circuitry of our affections: the queer collection of things that comprise media ecologies.",2014,Laterality

"Community Health Clubs for Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) improvement in Rural Burkina Faso",": 2.055_HRW How do international health electives impact medical students in their long term career paths? L. Buckvar-Keltz, E. Robinson, C. Gillespie, M. Hopkins; The Office of Student Affairs, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY, USA, Global Health Initiatives, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY, USA, Division of Education Quality, Institute for Innovations in Medical Education, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY, USA Program/Project Purpose: The New York University School of Medicine (NYUSOM) has been engaging medical students in global health across their years in medical school through itsâ€™ International Health Program (IHP) since 2002. All students in good academic standing are supported to participate in culturally meaningful and socially relevant research in any location that meets US State Department safe travel advisories. Students can also participate in self-funded clinical rotations. The program aims to increase the cultural competency of medical graduates as they enter the workforce to serve an increasingly diverse patient population. Our assumption was that IHP participants would have increased cultural competency, increased engagement with underserved populations, and increased incorporation of global health in their career paths. Structure/Method/Design: To understand the impact of this program we conducted a simple cross-sectional cohort study of graduates of the program from 2002 to 2012. Survey questions included demographic data as well as subjective impact of the IHP program on their residency and career choices. Outcome & Evaluation: We received 49 responses out of 213 surveys distributed by email to past participants of the IHP. Analysis of the data showed that international experiences later in medical school, rather than earlier, had a higher impact on career plans (mean of 2.70 verses mean of 2.00). Moreover, electives with both research and clinical components positively impacted career plans. Clinical rotations appeared to have slightly more impact on cultural competency than research rotations (mean of 3.82 verses mean of 3.39). Students who had not studied abroad previously (n 1â„4 24) reported that IHP had a greater impact on cultural competence, commitment to global health, and commitment to caring for the under-served than those who had previously studied abroad (n 1â„4 24). Going Forward: International heath experiences for medical students appear to have a significant impact on career paths as well as improving cultural competency. These findings can potentially benefit human resources for health by increasing US graduates long-term engagement in global public health and for working with underserved populations. We feel there is also strong argument for supporting first time international experiences for medical students. Funding: Office of Student Affairs at the NYU School ofMedicine.

Berggren; The Centre Muraz, Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso, West Africa, The Center for Medical Humanities & Ethics, School of Medicine, The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA Purpose: Only 6.7% of Burkina Fasoâ€™s people have access to improved sanitation. Risk for food, vector or waterborne disease is high: diarrhea, malaria, and helminths remain preventable causes of mortality and poverty. In December 2014 we piloted Community Health Clubs for WASH behavior change in a village of 2000. The aims of this project are to: 1. Improve WASH-related knowledge and behaviors; 2. Prevent WASH-related diseases; 3. Create enduring community-based social structures with capacity to sustain health gains and nurture sustainable development. Design: A knowledge and practices survey of 70 randomly selected family compounds was conducted before project implementation. Village leaders identified candidate facilitators from the community. We trained 19 facilitators in a picture-based WASH curriculum Human Resources and Workforce A n n a l s o f G l o b a l H e a l t h , V O L . 8 2 , N O . 3 , 2 0 1 6 M a yeJ u n e 2 0 1 6 : 4 7 3 â€“ 5 1 0 496 starting with germ theory and progressing to hand washing, water safety, human waste management, and vector control. Facilitators recruited 9 health clubs with over 650 members. Nearly 100% of club members completed the 22-week program, documented by membership cards recording attendance and WASH practices. The household survey will be repeated in December 2015. This evaluation was approved by the UT Health Science Center Institutional Review Board (HSC20140088e). Outcomes: Survey respondents were mostly female (57%), had not attended school (70%), and had a median age of 51. Most (67%) obtained drinking water from protected communal hand-pumps. Although 81% did not treat water, 10% of those drinking river water used crude filters. 83% did not own a latrine. Asked to identify 5 key opportunities for hand washing, 45% could provide no answer, while 2% provided >3 correct answers. Only 7% reported hand-washing after defecation. Appropriate tests will analyze knowledge; drinking water, defecation and hand washing behaviors; and diarrhea incidence after the intervention. Regressions will describe WASH knowledge and behavior predictors. Going Forward: We demonstrate feasibility of implementing a lowcost, participatory education program with high retention rates to prevent WASH-related illnesses in rural Burkina Faso. This approach could also defend against other health threats in West Africa, including Ebola. Next year 2 villages will join the program and outcomes will be measured using household inventories (behavioral observation tool) and household registers monitoring morbidity and mortality. Club and non-Club villages will eventually be compared.

This program aligns with EqualHealthâ€™s (EQ) vision of a Haitian medical education system that is high-quality, Haitian-led, and filled with opportunity. It also draws upon the resources of the Brigham and Womenâ€™s Hospital (BWH), with its long record of innovation and leadership in medical education and global health. Structure/Method/Design: In August 2015, two Haitian physicians were selected as EQâ€™s inaugural fellows via a competitive process. Their employing hospitals in Haiti agreed to their participation in a yearlong fellowship that includes a three-month, Boston-based curriculum, and guaranteed them the support necessary to implement new education programs upon return. The Boston-based curriculum includes: a weekly series of didactic sessions on the principles of effective teaching; participation in regular BWH and Harvard Medical School educational activities, such as teaching conference presentations and rounds with master educators; and assorted professional development opportunities at other Harvard institutions. For the remaining nine months, the fellows return to their Haitian teaching hospitals to serve as clinician educators, during which they co-teach courses taught by visiting teachers at their site and receive ongoing mentorship and leadership training from EQ staff. Outcome & Evaluation: The Fellowship is being evaluated using pre/post testing, scoring of videotaped teaching sessions by blinded reviewers, self-assessment questionnaires, regular feedback interviews, and other modalities. Initial feedback from the fellows has been strongly positive overall, with teaching conferences, Harvard Business School classes, and observed teaching experiences receiving special mention. Among the challenges faced thus far have been the language barrier; the logistics of moving the fellows between multiple teaching sites; and the creation of sufficient opportunities for the fellows to practice teaching within the Boston curriculum. Going Forward: The Fellowship is an innovative professional development opportunity for Haitian clinician educators, an intensive learning experience drawing on five Harvard institutions and involving close partnership with Haiti-based teaching hospitals. The Fellowship represents a new model of partnership for development of global medical education systems. Funding: The Fellowship is funded via private donations to EQ.
