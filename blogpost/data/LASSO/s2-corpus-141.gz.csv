"Indice De Masa Corporal Y Su RelaciÃ³n Con La Prevalencia De Caries Dental En Escolares De Huando, Huancavelica, PerÃº, 2016","Introduction and objective: Understanding the impact of metabolic disorderson health has become a global problem in recent years. To determinethe relationship between the Body Mass Index (BMI) and the prevalence ofdental caries in schoolchildren from 6 to 12 years of age in Huando-Huancavelica,in 2016. Materials and methods: Observational, descriptive,cross-sectional study. The sample consisted of 220 randomly selected students, meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria and following ethical standards inresearch. The data were analyzed in the SPSS 21 program using frequency distributiontables and the chi square test to determine the existence of association betweenBMI and dental caries. Results: The prevalence of dental caries was 91.82% (CPO-D= 4.08, ceo-d = 5.81). Regarding the nutritional status, 30 children presented malnutrition(13.63%) and 23 overweight (10.45), the rest had a weight and height adequatefor their age, and none presented the condition of obesity. There was no statisticalassociation between BMI and dental caries (p = 0.612). Conclusions: Malnutritiondoes not predispose to the presence of carious lesions due to their multifactorialetiology, we must point out that both are priority problems in public health, requiringa joint work between parents and educational authorities.",2018,
Lack of direct correlation between CD4 T-lymphocyte counts and induration sizes of the tuberculin skin test in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 seropositive patients.,"SETTING
The study was conducted in Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso, where Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection are prevalent.


OBJECTIVE
To identify proportions of representative (test) populations who are reactive to the tuberculin skin test, and to study the relationship between CD4 T-lymphocyte counts and the induration size of the tuberculin skin test in these groups.


DESIGN
A group of 435 healthy students was tuberculin skin tested in order to evaluate the intensity of skin testing in a 'normal' population. The study group consisted of 195 subjects with or without tuberculosis, and with or without HIV-1 infection, who received a tuberculin skin test and a CD4 T lymphocyte count on the same day.


RESULTS
In total, 90% of the control (nontuberculous, HIV negative) subjects, 32% of the HIV-1 seropositive subjects, 76.5% of the tuberculous patients and 57% of the tuberculous HIV-1 seropositive patients were tuberculin positive. There was no direct correlation between the induration size of reactions to the tuberculin skin test and CD4 T-lymphocyte count in these study groups using linear regression analysis.


CONCLUSION
In vivo skin testing using tuberculin yields clinically significant information on the degree of immunodeficiency which is different from that of CD4 T-lymphocyte counts. The tuberculin skin test should therefore be used as an independent marker of the weakened immunological status of HIV-1 seropositive subjects.",1998,The international journal of tuberculosis and lung disease : the official journal of the International Union against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease

DNA methylation profiling analysis identifies a DNA methylation signature for predicting prognosis and recurrence of lung adenocarcinoma,"The aim of the present study was to identify candidate prognostic DNA methylation biomarkers for lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), since the modern precise medicine for the treatment of LUAD requires more biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets of interest. DNA methylation profiling data of LUAD were downloaded from The Cancer Gene Atlas portal. Differentially methylated genes (DMGs) were screened to differentiate between samples designated as good and bad prognosis. LUAD-associated methylation modules were obtained with the weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) package, followed by function enrichment analysis. Optimal prognostic DMGs were selected using the LASSO estimation-based Cox-PH approach and were used to construct a prognostic risk scoring system. The training set was dichotomized by risk score, into high- and low-risk groups. The differences in overall survival (OS) time or recurrence-free survival (RFS) time between the two groups were evaluated using a Kaplan-Meier curve. A total of 742 DMG samples were screened for good and bad prognosis. WGCNA identified three LUAD-associated modules, which were primarily associated with cytoskeleton organization, transcription and apoptosis. A nine-gene prognostic methylation signature was determined, which included C20orf56, BTG2, C13orf16, DNASE1L1, ZDHHC3, FHDC1, ARF6, ITGB3 and ICAM4. A risk score-based methylation signature classified the patients in the training set into high- and low-risk groups with significantly different OS or RFS times. The prognostic value of the methylation signature was successfully verified in a validation set. In conclusion, the present study identified a nine-gene methylation signature for the prediction of survival and recurrence in patients with LUAD and improved the understanding of the alterations in DNA methylation in LUAD.",2019,Oncology Letters
Exploration and Mining of Educational data for Analyzing Student's Engagement,"In the recent years data mining and analytical tools are used to thoroughly observe and find unanticipated relationships with in the data. They are customized into useful, novel ways for the data owners by extracting insights. A lack of appropriate methods, findings for exploring the student-learning data using advanced feature selection methods has paved way for this idea. Events occurring in the most common sources of diverse learning platforms were identified where ever common engagements are observed facilitating Student participation. Completely anonymous data is used for analysis keeping ethical concerns in mind. LIWC is used for breaking down the text into numerical measures, helped to pop out any interesting patterns in the review comments. This research showcases different available advanced feature selection options while trying to exclude predictors with least impact on the dependant variable. Best subsets, Lasso, Ridge and Elastic net were evaluated with lowest MSE of 0.46 achieved for Ridge regression validated by k-fold technique. The data depicting most common student personalities is classified into 3 groups based on discrete learning events. The contribution of this work is an accurate prediction of linear models entities via validating different feature selection techniques. Student personalities were identified based on most common student participation platforms where both numerical and textual measures were considered for analysis.",2017,

Quantitative EEG (QEEG) Measures Differentiate Parkinson's Disease (PD) Patients from Healthy Controls (HC),"Objectives: To find out which Quantitative EEG (QEEG) parameters could best distinguish patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) with and without Mild Cognitive Impairment from healthy individuals and to find an optimal method for feature selection. Background: Certain QEEG parameters have been seen to be associated with dementia in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. Studies have also shown some parameters to be dependent on the stage of the disease. We wanted to investigate the differences in high-resolution QEEG measures between groups of PD patients and healthy individuals, and come up with a small subset of features that could accurately distinguish between the two groups. Methods: High-resolution 256-channel EEG were recorded in 50 PD patients (age 68.8 Â± 7.0 year; female/male 17/33) and 41 healthy controls (age 71.1 Â± 7.7 year; female/male 20/22). Data was processed to calculate the relative power in alpha, theta, delta, beta frequency bands across the different regions of the brain. Median, peak frequencies were also obtained and alpha1/theta ratios were calculated. Machine learning methods were applied to the data and compared. Additionally, penalized Logistic regression using LASSO was applied to the data in R and a subset of best-performing features was obtained. Results: Random Forest and LASSO were found to be optimal methods for feature selection. A group of six measures selected by LASSO was seen to have the most effect in differentiating healthy individuals from PD patients. The most important variables were the theta power in temporal left region and the alpha1/theta ratio in the central left region. Conclusion: The penalized regression method applied was helpful in selecting a small group of features from a dataset that had high multicollinearity.",2017,Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience

Multiple m6A RNA methylation modulators promote the malignant progression of hepatocellular carcinoma and affect its clinical prognosis,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second most common cause of cancer-related death in the world. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA methylation is dynamically regulated by m6A RNA methylation modulators (â€œwriter,â€ â€œeraser,â€ and â€œreaderâ€ proteins), which are associated with cancer occurrence and development. The purpose of this study was to explore the relationships between m6A RNA methylation modulators and HCC. First, using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) databases, we compared the expression levels of 13 major m6A RNA methylation modulators between HCC and normal tissues. Second, we applied consensus clustering to the expression data on the m6A RNA methylation modulators to divide the HCC tissues into two subgroups (clusters 1 and 2), and we compared the clusters in terms of overall survival (OS), World Health Organization (WHO) stage, and pathological grade. Third, using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, we constructed a risk signature involving the m6A RNA methylation modulators that affected OS in TCGA and ICGC analyses. We found that the expression levels of 12 major m6A RNA methylation modulators were significantly different between HCC and normal tissues. After dividing the HCC tissues into clusters 1 and 2, we found that cluster 2 had poorer OS, higher WHO stage, and higher pathological grade. Four m6A RNA methylation modulators (YTHDF1, YTHDF2, METTL3, and KIAA1429) affecting OS in the TCGA and ICGC analyses were selected to construct a risk signature, which was significantly associated with WHO stage and was also an independent prognostic marker of OS. In summary, m6A RNA methylation modulators are key participants in the malignant progression of HCC and have potential value in prognostication and treatment decisions.",2020,BMC Cancer
Bayesian accelerated failure time models based on penalized mixtures of Gaussians: regularization and variable selection,"In many biostatistical applications concerned with the analysis of duration times and especially those including high-dimensional genetic information, the following three extensions of classical accelerated failure time (AFT) models are required: (1) a flexible, nonparametric estimate of the survival time distribution, (2) a structured additive predictor including linear as well as nonlinear effects of continuous covariates and possibly further types of effects such as random or spatial effects, and (3) regularization and variable selection of high-dimensional effect vectors. Although a lot of research has dealt with these features separately, the development of AFT models combining them in a unified framework has not been considered yet. We present a Bayesian approach for modeling and inference in such flexible AFT models, incorporating a penalized Gaussian mixture error distribution, a structured additive predictor with Bayesian P-splines as a main ingredient, and Bayesian versions of ridge and LASSO as well as a spike and slab priors to enforce sparseness. Priors for regression coefficients are conditionally Gaussian, facilitating Markov chain Monte Carlo inference. The proposed model class is extensively tested in simulation studies and applied in the analysis of acute myeloid leukemia survival times considering microarray information as well as clinical covariates as prognostic factors.",2015,AStA Advances in Statistical Analysis
Variable larval growth in a coral reef fish,"Understanding the functional linkages between the pelagic and demersal stages of marine organisms is a central goal in ecology. To better understand events that occurred during the larval period as well as their initial influence on juvenile traits, we examined individual level varia- tion in early life-history traits (larval and early juvenile otolith growth rates, size-at-age, and larval duration) of 3 seasonal cohorts of the common coral reef fish Thalassoma bifasciatum (Bloch) (Labri- dae). Juveniles were collected at regular intervals (every second day) for 2 wk following their first appearance on the nearshore reefs of Barbados, West Indies. Otolith analysis indicated that each cohort exhibited a broad range of larval traits. Individuals with shorter larval durations had faster otolith growth and settled at relatively smaller sizes (based on otolith length and standard length) than larvae with longer larval durations, which exhibited slower otolith growth rates. Despite the range in larval durations for T. bifasciatum, otolith growth records revealed no evidence for delay of metamorphosis. Instead, the range in larval durations is likely to be the result of a variable pelagic environment influencing growth rates. Because metamorphosis in this species is an energetically costly non-feeding (3 to 5 d) period, we propose that successful metamorphosis requires a minimum energy reserve. Slower growers may need to remain in the plankton longer (consequently attaining larger sizes) to obtain this minimum condition. Variability in early life-history traits also occurred among the seasonal cohorts. Despite differences in patterns of larval otolith growth, mean larval duration was similar for the 2 fall cohorts (57 and 55 d), but much shorter for the spring cohort (42 d). Such inter-cohort variability in early life-history traits suggests a variable pelagic environment. In contrast to the larval period, juvenile growth rates were much less variable within and among cohorts, reflecting a more constant physical and biological environment on the reef.",2000,Marine Ecology Progress Series

Online Adaptive Estimation of Sparse Signals: Where RLS Meets the $\ell_1$ -Norm,"Using the â„“1-norm to regularize the least-squares criterion, the batch least-absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) has well-documented merits for estimating sparse signals of interest emerging in various applications where observations adhere to parsimonious linear regression models. To cope with high complexity, increasing memory requirements, and lack of tracking capability that batch Lasso estimators face when processing observations sequentially, the present paper develops a novel time-weighted Lasso (TWL) approach. Performance analysis reveals that TWL cannot estimate consistently the desired signal support without compromising rate of convergence. This motivates the development of a time- and norm-weighted Lasso (TNWL) scheme with â„“1-norm weights obtained from the recursive least-squares (RLS) algorithm. The resultant algorithm consistently estimates the support of sparse signals without reducing the convergence rate. To cope with sparsity-aware recursive real-time processing, novel adaptive algorithms are also developed to enable online coordinate descent solvers of TWL and TNWL that provably converge to the true sparse signal in the time-invariant case. Simulated tests compare competing alternatives and corroborate the performance of the novel algorithms in estimating time-invariant signals, and tracking time-varying signals under sparsity constraints.",2010,IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing
On scaling of soft-thresholding estimator,"LASSO is known to have a problem of excessive shrinkage at a sparse representation. To analyze this problem in detail, in this paper, we consider a positive scaling for soft-thresholding estimators that are LASSO estimators in an orthogonal regression problem. We especially consider a non-parametric orthogonal regression problem which includes wavelet denosing. We first gave a risk (generalization error) of LARS (least angle regression) based soft-thresholding with a single scaling parameter. We then showed that an optimal scaling value that minimizes the risk under a sparseness condition is 1 + O ( log n / n ) , where n is the number of samples. The important point is that the optimal value of scaling is larger than one. This implies that expanding soft-thresholding estimator shows a better generalization performance compared to a naive soft-thresholding. This also implies that a risk of LARS-based soft-thresholding with the optimal scaling is smaller than without scaling. We then showed their difference is O ( log n / n ) . This also shows an effectiveness of the introduction of scaling. Through simple numerical experiments, we found that LARS-based soft-thresholding with scaling can improve both of sparsity and generalization performance compared to a naive soft-thresholding.",2016,Neurocomputing
Prediction of risk scores for colorectal cancer patients from the concentration of proteins involved in mitochondrial apoptotic pathway,"One of the major challenges in managing the treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients is to predict risk scores or level of risk for CRC patients. In past, several biomarkers, based on concentration of proteins involved in type-2/intrinsic/mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, have been identified for prognosis of colorectal cancer patients. Recently, a prognostic tool DR_MOMP has been developed that can discriminate high and low risk CRC patients with reasonably high accuracy (Hazard Ratio, HR = 5.24 and p-value = 0.0031). This prognostic tool showed an accuracy of 59.7% when used to predict favorable/unfavorable survival outcomes. In this study, we developed knowledge based models for predicting risk scores of CRC patients. Models were trained and evaluated on 134 stage III CRC patients. Firstly, we developed multiple linear regression based models using different techniques and achieved a maximum HR value of 6.34 with p-value = 0.0032 for a model developed using LassoLars technique. Secondly, models were developed using a parameter optimization technique and achieved a maximum HR value of 38.13 with p-value 0.0006. We also predicted favorable/unfavorable survival outcomes and achieved maximum prediction accuracy value of 71.64%. A further enhancement in the performance was observed if clinical factors are added to this model. Addition of age as a variable to the model improved the HR to 40.11 with p-value as 0.0003 and also boosted the accuracy to 73.13%. The performance of our models were evaluated using five-fold cross-validation technique. For providing service to the community we also developed a web server 'CRCRpred', to predict risk scores of CRC patients, which is freely available at https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/crcrpred.",2019,PLoS ONE
Bridge estimators and the adaptive lasso under heteroscedasticity,"In this paper we investigate penalized least squares methods in linear regression models with heteroscedastic error structure. It is demonstrated that the basic properties with respect to model selection and parameter estimation of bridge estimators, Lasso and adaptive Lasso do not change if the assumption of homoscedasticity is violated. However, these estimators do not have oracle properties in the sense of Fan and Li (2001) if the oracle is based on weighted least squares. In order to address this problem we introduce weighted penalized least squares methods and demonstrate their advantages by asymptotic theory and by means of a simulation study.",2012,Mathematical Methods of Statistics
Dynamic Screening: Accelerating First-Order Algorithms for the Lasso and Group-Lasso,"Recent computational strategies based on screening tests have been proposed to accelerate algorithms addressing penalized sparse regression problems such as the Lasso. Such approaches build upon the idea that it is worth dedicating some small computational effort to locate inactive atoms and remove them from the dictionary in a preprocessing stage so that the regression algorithm working with a smaller dictionary will then converge faster to the solution of the initial problem. We believe that there is an even more efficient way to screen the dictionary and obtain a greater acceleration: inside each iteration of the regression algorithm, one may take advantage of the algorithm computations to obtain a new screening test for free with increasing screening effects along the iterations. The dictionary is henceforth dynamically screened instead of being screened statically, once and for all, before the first iteration. We formalize this dynamic screening principle in a general algorithmic scheme and apply it by embedding inside a number of first-order algorithms adapted existing screening tests to solve the Lasso or new screening tests to solve the Group-Lasso. Computational gains are assessed in a large set of experiments on synthetic data as well as real-world sounds and images. They show both the screening efficiency and the gain in terms of running times.",2015,IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing

An evaluation of Food Net Cook and Taste courses in Birmingham,"Background:â€‚ Food Net, a part of the Birmingham Community Nutrition and Dietetic Department, has been running Cook and Taste courses since 2001, targeting areas of high deprivation. The aim of Food Net is to improve skills, knowledge and attitude, and thus reduce barriers to eating a diet that is likely to protect against cancer (World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute, 2007) and cardiovascular disease (Department of Health, 2000). The overall aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of these courses on eating behaviour, 7â€“12Â months after participation. 
 
Methods:â€‚ Subjects (nÂ =Â 41) were from a range of ethnicities and predominantly women (nÂ =Â 39 and were a subset of those who had attended a Cook and Taste course between January and June 2006). Qualitative methods were used to analyse comments collected from participants at the final session of each course (nÂ =Â 110), followed by a semi-structured, nonvalidated, telephone questionnaire 7â€“12 months after completing the course (nÂ =Â 41), and six in-depth interviews with a purposive sample. Participants were asked to report their fruit and vegetable intake on the previous day, and to rate their confidence to cook a healthy meal on a scale of 1â€“6, at the first and final sessions of the course, and again in the telephone interview. 
 
Results:â€‚ All subjects reported maintaining some positive changes to either their eating, cooking or shopping as a result of attending. At the final session of the course, participants reported an average increase in intake of fruit and vegetables of one portionÂ dayâˆ’1 (2.4â€“3.5) and an increase of one point in their confidence to cook (3.6â€“4.6 on a scale of 1â€“6), and this was maintained 7â€“12Â months later. Success was attributed by subjects to the practical approach and the attitudes of the Food Health Advisers who ran the sessions. The main motivation for participants to change their behaviour was for their children's benefit. 
 
Discussion:â€‚ These results suggest that this approach is effective for changing the eating behaviour of participants and their families. The Low Income, Diet and Nutrition Survey (Food Standards Agency, 2007) found that women in low-income groups consume an average of 2.4 portions of fruit and vegetables a day, which is comparable to the baseline in this study. The subjects in this study reported a higher average intake (3.5 portions) 7â€“12Â months after participating in a Cook and Taste course. This reported increase may lead to long-term health gain (Brunner et al., 2007). 
 
Conclusions:â€‚ Cook and Taste courses run by Food Net achieved reported beneficial changes to eating habits, which are maintained 7â€“12Â months after participation, suggesting this is an appropriate way of promoting nutritional health in this population.

Plasticity of Least Tern and Piping Plover nesting behaviors in response to sand temperature,"Abstract Birds that nest on the ground in open areas, like Piping Plovers (Charadrius melodus) and interior Least Terns (Sternula antillarum athalassos), are exposed to high temperatures in thermally stressful environments. As a result, some ground-nesting avian species have adapted behavioral strategies to maintain thermal regulation of eggs and themselves. We assessed the impact of sand temperature on shorebird nesting behaviors by installing video cameras and thermocouples at 52 Least Tern and 55 Piping Plover nests on the Missouri River in North Dakota during the 2014â€“2015 breeding seasons. Daily duration and frequency of shading behaviors exhibited a nonlinear relationship with temperature; therefore, we used segmented regressions to determine at what threshold temperature (mean temperatureâ€¯=â€¯25.7â¸°C for shading behavior daily frequency and mean temperatureâ€¯=â€¯25.1â¸°C for shading behavior daily duration) shorebird adults exhibited a behavioral response to rising sand temperatures.

Comparative Effectiveness and Safety of Bariatric Procedures for Weight Loss,"In the past decade, there has been a dramatic shift in surgical procedures performed for weight loss in the United States (1). Although Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) predominated through the late 2000s, sleeve gastrectomy (SG) has surpassed it in the number of procedures performed in the United States and worldwide (2, 3). The adjustable gastric banding (AGB) procedure was popular in the mid-to-late 2000s, but it now accounts for fewer than 10% of annual U.S. bariatric procedures (4). Despite this rapid shift, long-term data comparing the efficacy and safety of SG versus RYGB and AGB are lacking. At least 66 randomized controlled trials or observational studies have directly compared RYGB (n = 88672 total patients) and SG (n = 22100 total patients) (511). However, just 16 involved U.S. samples, and only 5 had at least 5 years of follow-up (n = 845 total SG patients and 867 total RYGB patients) (511). Thus, the long-term comparative effectiveness of SG, RYGB, and AGB is largely unknown, and there is no consensus in the medical community about the clinical utility of these procedures for weight loss (12), leading to unwarranted variation in insurance coverage and use of these procedures in the United States (1316). More data are needed in larger, more broadly representative samples with long-term follow-up to inform clinical and policy decisions about bariatric surgery. In 2016, the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute funded the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet) Bariatric Study (PBS) to demonstrate the utility of PCORnet in promoting evidence-based and patient-centered health care. The PBS aims to compare the safety and effectiveness of the most common bariatric procedures in the United States (16, 17) by examining electronic health record data from 11 geographically diverse PCORnet Clinical Data Research Networks (CDRNs) (18). In this article, we present findings on the comparative effectiveness of SG, RYGB, and AGB for weight loss among adults at 1, 3, and 5 years after surgery. We hypothesized that the procedures would lead to significantly different weight loss trajectories over 5 years. In addition, we leveraged the large sample size enabled by PCORnet to explore the effects of bariatric procedures in clinical subpopulations. These results could help patients, providers, and payers better understand how different bariatric procedures affect health. Methods Study Setting and Population The PBS cohort and protocol were previously described (16). The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute (lead site) and was approved or determined to be exempt from review by participating sites through individual IRB review or reliance agreements. The PBS is guided by a stakeholder advisory group (comprising patients, advocacy groups, adult and pediatric surgeons, obesity medicine providers, and payers) that helped identify relevant outcomes, prioritize analyses, advise on study design, and plan for dissemination of findings. We identified patients who had a primary bariatric procedure at health systems affiliated with participating CDRNs (Appendix Table 1) from 1 January 2005 through 30 September 2015. PCORnet uses a common data model to facilitate queries of standardized data (18). The PBS team collaborated with the PCORnet Coordinating Center to develop a bariatric case definition and query program. The cohort was identified using codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9); Current Procedural Terminology (CPT-4); and the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (Appendix Tables 2 and 3), which were extracted from the PCORnet common data model at each site. Appendix Table 1. Participating PCORnet CDRNs and Sites Contributing Data Appendix Table 2. Bariatric Surgery Procedure Codes Used as Inclusion Criteria* Appendix Table 3. Codes Used as Exclusion Criteria* Bariatric procedures were identified from more than 100 million patient records in 41 health systems from the 11 CDRNs. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are shown in Figure 1. For each patient, the first observed bariatric procedure was considered the index procedure; these had to occur in inpatient or ambulatory care encounters. We then excluded patients who were younger than 20 years or aged 80 years or older at the index procedure (n = 1809); those with multiple conflicting bariatric procedure codes on the same day (n = 1113); those with any revisional bariatric procedure code (n = 4576), gastrointestinal cancer diagnosis code (n = 4027), or fundoplasty (n = 119) in the year before the index procedure; those with an emergency department encounter on the day of the index procedure (n = 485); and those with no body mass index (BMI) data (n = 12510) or no BMI of 35 kg/m2 or greater (n = 1918) in the year before the procedure. We then excluded 18583 patients who did not have a BMI measurement at 1, 3, or 5 years after surgery, resulting in a final sample of 46510 adults with baseline and follow-up BMI measurements. Figure 1. Flow diagram for identification of the adult PCORnet Bariatric Study cohort in 11 CDRNs. BMI = body mass index; CDRN = Clinical Data Research Network; PCORnet = National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network. * Patients could be excluded for >1 reason. Data Extraction We used SAS queries developed by the PCORnet Coordinating Center to extract information on eligible patients from participating sites, including site identifier; year of surgery; age at the index procedure; sex; race/ethnicity; deidentified dates of all encounters; all measures of height, weight, BMI, and blood pressure; all repeated or revisional bariatric procedures; presence of relevant comorbidities (anxiety, deep venous thrombosis, depression, eating disorder, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hypertension, infertility, kidney disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, obstructive sleep apnea, lower-extremity osteoarthritis, polycystic ovarian syndrome, psychosis, pulmonary embolism, smoking, or substance use disorder); and all diagnoses and procedures related to pregnancy. We used information from the year before surgery to calculate the CharlsonElixhauser comorbidity index score for each patient (19). The CharlsonElixhauser index was developed to predict mortality in older adults, but we used it to help address potential confounding because patients with higher risk for death might be offered a lower-risk procedure. Diagnoses were identified through ICD-9-CM and Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine codes (available on request). Additional details on variable construction are provided in the Statistical Appendix section of the Supplement. Supplement. Supplementary Material Outcomes Our primary outcome was percent total weight loss (TWL) at 1, 3, and 5 years, calculated as follows: (weight in kilograms at each time pointweight in kilograms at surgery)/weight in kilograms at surgery100 (20). We used pairwise comparisons of percent TWL between procedures (RYGB vs. SG, SG vs. AGB, and RYGB vs. AGB) among patients with at least 1 weight measurement at 1 year (6 to 18 months), 3 years (30 to 42 months), and 5 years (54 to 66 months) after surgery. Follow-up for weight measurements began at the index procedure date and ceased at the end of the study period (30 September 2015) or when the patient switched to a different bariatric procedure. Because pregnancy affects body weight, we ignored anthropometric measurements during pregnancy, defined as the 9 months before and the 3 months after any code indicating full-term delivery, preterm delivery, miscarriage, or abortion. Data were cleaned to remove biologically implausible values for height (<4 or 8 ft), weight (<70 or 700 lb), and BMI (<15 or 90 kg/m2) (21). Secondary analyses examined the proportion of patients achieving TWL greater than 5%, 10%, 20%, and 30% at each time point. We also examined 30-day rates of major adverse events, defined as any death, reoperation, percutaneous or endoscopic intervention, venous thromboembolism, or failure to be discharged from the hospital within 30 days (22, 23), among 65093 patients who had complete information at baseline. Longer-term data on adverse events were not available. Statistical Analysis Weight Loss Outcomes Mean adjusted weight at 1, 3, and 5 years with each procedure was estimated using a linear mixed-effects (random-effects) model framework (24). For patients included in each pairwise comparison at each time point, all available postsurgery weight measures were used. Each model estimated a mean population-level time-varying curve for the trend in weight from the time of surgery to the end of the study and included random-effects terms for patient (intercept) and follow-up time (slope). For clinical relevance in presentation, we transformed mean adjusted weight to mean percent TWL and mean weight change, but all inferences were made on the mean weight estimates (including P values) and 95% CIs were transformed from those for mean weight. Additional details are provided in the Statistical Appendix section of the Supplement. Confounding To control for potential confounding variables, a propensity score model was constructed for each pairwise analysis and time point cohort. The propensity score estimated the probability of having a specific bariatric procedure given baseline (presurgery) covariates. In each cohort, variables were selected and parameters were estimated simultaneously using maximum penalized likelihood estimation and the LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) method (see the Statistical Appendix section of the Supplement for details) (25). In addition to adjusting for deciles of predicted propensity score, we included main effects for weight, sex, age, and all other baseline covariates in the outcome model (Table 1). Table 1.

Independently Interpretable Lasso for Generalized Linear Models,"Sparse regularization such as â„“1 regularization is a quite powerful and widely used strategy for high-dimensional learning problems. The effectiveness of sparse regularization has been supported practically and theoretically by several studies. However, one of the biggest issues in sparse regularization is that its performance is quite sensitive to correlations between features. Ordinary â„“1 regularization selects variables correlated with each other under weak regularizations, which results in deterioration of not only its estimation error but also interpretability. In this letter, we propose a new regularization method, independently interpretable lasso (IILasso), for generalized linear models. Our proposed regularizer suppresses selecting correlated variables, so that each active variable affects the response independently in the model. Hence, we can interpret regression coefficients intuitively, and the performance is also improved by avoiding overfitting. We analyze the theoretical property of the IILasso and show that the proposed method is advantageous for its sign recovery and achieves almost minimax optimal convergence rate. Synthetic and real data analyses also indicate the effectiveness of the IILasso.",2020,Neural Computation

Brazil or Germany - who will win the trophy? Prediction of the FIFA World Cup 2014 based on team-specific regularized Poisson regression,"In this article an approach for the analysis and prediction of soc- cer match results is proposed. It is based on a regularized Poisson regression model that includes various potentially influential covariates describing the national teams' success in previous FIFA World Cups. Additionally, sim- ilar to Bradley-Terry-Luce models, dierences of team-specific eects of the competing teams are included. It is discussed that within the gener- alized linear model (GLM) framework the team-specific eects can either be incorporated in the form of fixed or random eects. In order to achieve variable selection and shrinkage, we use tailored Lasso approaches. Based on the three preceding FIFA World Cups, two competing models for the prediction of the FIFA World Cup 2014 are fitted and investigated.

Smooth Bias Estimation for Multipath Mitigation Using Sparse Estimation,"Multipath remains the main source of error when using global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) in constrained environment, leading to biased measurements and thus to inaccurate estimated positions. This paper formulates the GNSS navigation problem as the resolution of an overdetermined system, which depends nonlinearly on the receiver position and linearly on the clock bias and drift, and possible biases affecting GNSS measurements. The extended Kalman filter is used to linearize the navigation problem whereas sparse estimation is considered to estimate multipath biases. We assume that only a part of the satellites are affected by multipath, i.e., that the unknown bias vector is sparse in the sense that several of its components are equal to zero. The natural way of enforcing sparsity is to introduce an $\ell_{1}$ regularization associated with the bias vector. This leads to a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) problem that is solved using a reweighted@ $\ell_{1}$ algorithm. The weighting matrix of this algorithm is designed carefully as functions of the satellite carrier to noise density ratio and the satellite elevations. The smooth variations of multipath biases versus time are enforced using a regularization based on total variation. An experiment conducted on real data allows the performance of the proposed method to be appreciated.",2018,2018 21st International Conference on Information Fusion (FUSION)
"Early Cretaceous Palynological Assemblages from the Wulangai Basin,inner Mongolia","The Wulangai Basin of Inner Mongolia extends within limits of about 117Â°6'â€”119Â°30'E longitude and 44Â°45'â€”45Â°56'N latitude,with a total area of 15 000 km2.A diverse and well preserved sporo-pollen grains from the Lower Cretaceous has been obtained by drills for coal and oil exploration.In this paper 143 morphological types from 77 genera and 2 species of fossil algae are identified.Two palynological assemblages are recognized.Detailed sporo-pollen and their average percentages of each assemblage are shown in the Chinese text(Table 1).1 Cyathidites-Cicatricosisporites-Podocarpidites AssemblageThis assemblage is obtained from the Lower Damoguaihe Formation.The assemblage consisting of 110 species in 61 genera and one species of fossil algae shows the following characteristics.The coniferous(59.71%â€”91.48%)is the dominant group in this assemblage.The pteridophyta spore(8.25%â€”58.70%)is comparatively lower.The angiosperm pollen is lacking.The spores of pteridophyta(29.53%)consist of 69 species,35 genera.Among them,spores related to Lygodiaceae(6.75%),Cyatheaceae(6.26%),Osmundaceae(3.96%),Selagiinellaceae(2.75%)and Lycopodiaceae(2.06%)are abundant in amount and composition,mainly including such genera as Cicatricosisporites(3.83%),Pilosisporites(1.80%),Impardecispora(0.67%),Cyathidites,Osmundacidites,Aequitriradites(1.61%)and Lycopodiumsporites(1.96%).The pollen of gymnosperm is characterized by new types of pollen(34.44%),such as Podocarpidites(3.9%),Pinuspollenites(11.85%),Piceaepollenites(7.12%),Abiespollenites(7.03%)and Cedripites(2.12%).A lot of palaeoconiferous types of pollen(24.21%),such as Pseudopicea(2.25%)and Protoconiferus(1.50%).The monocolpate types(including Bennettita and Ginkgoaceae)(0.42%)is very lower in content.Cheirolepidiaceae genus Classopollis(1.07%)is less.2 Cicatricosisporites-Appendicisporites-Pinuspollenites AssemblageThis assemblage is obtained from the Upper Damoguaihe Formation.The assemblage consists of 104 species in 65 genera and two species of fossil algae.Compared with the lower assemblage,the pteridophytic spore increases at diversity and content,the following genera come in to being for the first time:Appendicisporites,Crybelosporites.It is also similar in the main types,but different in the great increase of Lygodiaceae spores,which include mainly Appendicisporites(2.63%)and Cicatricosisporites(21.75%).The gymnospermous pollen of Disaccites is mainly new types of Pinuspollenites(15.42%),Piceaepollenites(7.56%)and Abiespollenites(3.4%).The angiosperms pollen occur but quite rarely.The present palynological assemblages are correlatable with those of Early Cretaceous from other parts of China.According to the chief forms,the present assemblages can roughly be compared with those palynological assemblages from the Jiufotang and Shahai formations in western Liaoning Province,the Saihantala Formation in Eren Basin,Inner Mongolia as well as the Damoguaihe Formatiom from Hailar Basin and Daxingan Mountain in NE China.",2010,
ST ] 2 3 Ju l 2 01 9 Sparse Regularization for Mixture Problems,"Abstract: This paper investigates the statistical estimation of a discrete mixing measure Î¼ involved in a kernel mixture model. Using some recent advances in l1regularization over the space of measures, we introduce a â€œdata fitting + regularizationâ€ convex program for estimating Î¼ in a grid-less manner, this method is referred to as Beurling-LASSO. Our contribution is two-fold: we derive a lower bound on the bandwidth of our data fitting term depending only on the support of Î¼ and its so-called â€œminimum separationâ€ to ensure quantitative support localization error bounds; and under a so-called â€œnondegenerate source conditionâ€ we derive a non-asymptotic support stability property. This latter shows that for sufficiently large sample size n, our estimator has exactly as many weighted Dirac masses as the target Î¼, converging in amplitude and localization towards the true ones. The statistical performances of this estimator are investigated designing a so-called â€œdual certificateâ€, which will be appropriate to our setting. Some classical situations, as e.g. Gaussian or ordinary smooth mixtures (e.g. Laplace distributions), are discussed at the end of the paper. We stress in particular that our method is completely adaptive w.r.t. the number of components involved in the mixture.",2019,
On the data-driven inference of modulatory networks in climate science: An application to West African rainfall,"Abstract. Decades of hypothesis-driven and/or first-principles research have been applied towards the discovery and explanation of the mechanisms that drive climate phenomena, such as western African Sahel summer rainfall~variability. Although connections between various climate factors have been theorized, not all of the key relationships are fully understood. We propose a data-driven approach to identify candidate players in this climate system, which can help explain underlying mechanisms and/or even suggest new relationships, to facilitate building a more comprehensive and predictive model of the modulatory relationships influencing a climate phenomenon of interest. We applied coupled heterogeneous association rule mining (CHARM), Lasso multivariate regression, and dynamic Bayesian networks to find relationships within a complex system, and explored means with which to obtain a consensus result from the application of such varied methodologies. Using this fusion of approaches, we identified relationships among climate factors that modulate Sahel rainfall. These relationships fall into two categories: well-known associations from prior climate knowledge, such as the relationship with the El Ninoâ€“Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and putative links, such as North Atlantic Oscillation, that invite further research.",2014,Nonlinear Processes in Geophysics

In literature usually onlyone single asymmetric (Alpha, Beta or Gamma) divergence is considered. We show inthis paper that there exist families of such divergences with the same consistent properties.Moreover, we establish links and correspondences among these divergences by applyingsuitable nonlinear transformations. For example, we can generate the Beta-divergencesdirectly from Alpha-divergences and vice versa. Furthermore, we show that a new wide classof Gamma-divergences can be generated not only from the family of Beta-divergences butalso from a family of Alpha-divergences. The paper bridges these divergences and showsalso their links to Tsallis and RÂ´enyi entropies.

Variability in relative importance of determinants of reef fish recruitment,"Multiple processes can act together to determine abundance of organisms and structure of communities. Recently, appreciation of this fact has motivated development of conceptual and statistical frameworks that quantitatively assess the relative importance of multiple causal factors. However, little consideration has been given to variability in the â€œimportanceâ€ of processes through space and time (i.e. robustness), which represents another facet of a processâ€™s importance. Here, I focused on populations of a coral reef fish (Thalassoma hardwicke) and used an existing analytical method to assess the relative importance of initial population inputs (larval supply) and subsequent juvenile mortality in determining the average abundances of juvenile fish populations in different locations and times. The relative importance of processes varied significantly both temporally and spatially across a range of scales, and indicate a need for future assessments of relative importance to incorporate this variability.",1999,Ecology Letters
New In-Depth Analytical Approach of the Porcine Seminal Plasma Proteome Reveals Potential Fertility Biomarkers.,"A complete characterization of the proteome of seminal plasma (SP) is an essential step to understand how SP influences sperm function and fertility after artificial insemination (AI). The purpose of this study was to identify which among characterized proteins in boar SP were differently expressed among AI boars with significantly different fertility outcomes. A total of 872 SP proteins, 390 of them belonging specifically to Sus Scrofa taxonomy, were identified (Experiment 1) by using a novel proteomic approach that combined size exclusion chromatography and solid-phase extraction as prefractionation steps prior to Nano LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis. The SP proteomes of 26 boars showing significant differences in farrowing rate (n = 13) and litter size (n = 13) after the AI of 10â€¯526 sows were further analyzed (Experiment 2). A total of 679 SP proteins were then quantified by the SWATH approach, where the penalized linear regression LASSO revealed differentially expressed SP proteins for farrowing rate (FURIN, AKR1B1, UBA1, PIN1, SPAM1, BLMH, SMPDL3A, KRT17, KRT10, TTC23, and AGT) and litter size (PN-1, THBS1, DSC1, and CAT).

Simultaneous Channel and Feature Selection of Fused EEG Features Based on Sparse Group Lasso,"Feature extraction and classification of EEG signals are core parts of brain computer interfaces (BCIs). Due to the high dimension of the EEG feature vector, an effective feature selection algorithm has become an integral part of research studies. In this paper, we present a new method based on a wrapped Sparse Group Lasso for channel and feature selection of fused EEG signals. The high-dimensional fused features are firstly obtained, which include the power spectrum, time-domain statistics, AR model, and the wavelet coefficient features extracted from the preprocessed EEG signals. The wrapped channel and feature selection method is then applied, which uses the logistical regression model with Sparse Group Lasso penalized function. The model is fitted on the training data, and parameter estimation is obtained by modified blockwise coordinate descent and coordinate gradient descent method. The best parameters and feature subset are selected by using a 10-fold cross-validation. Finally, the test data is classified using the trained model. Compared with existing channel and feature selection methods, results show that the proposed method is more suitable, more stable, and faster for high-dimensional feature fusion. It can simultaneously achieve channel and feature selection with a lower error rate. The test accuracy on the data used from international BCI Competition IV reached 84.72%.",2015,BioMed Research International
"Platinum-group minerals and gold in Arsenic-rich ore at the Thompson mine, Thompson Nickel Belt, Manitoba, Canada","SummaryPlatinum-group minerals (PGM) and native gold are reported in association with gersdorffite Â± nickeline from the Thompson mine, Thompson Nickel Belt, Manitoba, Canada. Four PGM-gold-bearing ore types are distinguished on the basis of mineral assemblages and host rocks: I. Irarsite in massive Ni sulphide ore hosted by metapelite; II. Gold, sudburyite, testibiopalladite-antimonian michenerite, unnamed PGM, and merenskyite in As-rich Ni ore hosted by metapelite from the T-1 mine; III. Gold with tellurides in As-rich Ni ore hosted by metapelite from the open pit; and, IV. Gold, majakite, kotulskite, merenskyite, and michenerite in As-rich Ni ore hosted by pegmatite from the T-1 mine. Limited whole-rock assays of II yielded Pt < 10 ppb, Pd 18 ppm, and Au 13 ppm. Native gold is argentian (Ag22-Ag32), and most Ag-rich in pegmatite-hosted samples. Testibiopalladite compositions straddle the previously inferred miscibility gap with michenerite. The unnamed PGM has a composition of (Pd, Ni)0.44(Te, Sb)0.56, and is distinctly anisotropic. Sporadic, minor amounts of PGE (Ru excepted) are present in gersdorffite and nickeline.All ore types are associated with a pervasive hydrothermal alteration of gangue minerals and host rocks, that is characterised by allanite (ubiquitously present in Thompson mine ores and up to 5 vol% in II), and high contents of Cl, in ferropyrosmalite, allanite, biotite, and amphibole. The PGE-Au-As mineralisation was deposited at 250â€“300Â°C, 3â€“4 kbar, from Cl-rich fluids, which locally remobilised rare-earth elements (REE). It may represent a late overprint on the Thompson mine ores during the late retrograde alteration event of the Trans-Hudsonian orogeny in the Thompson Nickel Belt.ZusammenfassungPlatingruppen-Minerale (PGM) und gediegenes Gold kommen mit Gersdorffit und Nickelin in Erzen der Thompson Mine, Thompson Nickel-GÃ¼rtel, Manitoba, Kanada vor. Auf der Basis von Mineralassoziationen und Nebengesteinen lassen sich vier PGM und Gold-fÃ¼hrende Erztypen unterscheiden: I. Irarsit in massiven Nickelsulfid-Erzen in Metapeliten. II. Gold, Sudburyit, Testibiopalladit-Antimon-Michenerit, ein unbenanntes PGM und Merenskyit in As-reichen Nickelerzen in Metapeliten der T-1 Mine. III. Gold mit Telluriden in Arsen-reichen Nickelerzen in Metapeliten aus dem Tagebau; und IV. Gold, Majakit, Kotulskit, Merenskyit und Michenerit in Arsen-reichen Nickelerzen in Pegmatiten der T-1 Mine. Gesamtgesteinsanalysen des Types II ergaben Pt < 10 ppb, Pd 18 ppm und Gold 13 ppm. Gediegenes Gold ist silberfÃ¼hrend (Ag22-Ag32) und zeigt die hÃ¶chsten Silbergehalte in Proben aus dem Pegmatit. Die Zusammensetzungen von Testibiopalladit liegen entlang der frÃ¼her vermuteten MischungslÃ¼cke mit Michenerit. Das noch nicht benannte PGM hat die Zusammensetzung (Pd, Ni)0.44(Te, Sb)0.56, und ist deutlich anisotrop. Gelegentlich kommen kleinere Mengen von PGE (mit Ausname von Ru) in Gersdorffit und Nickelin vor.Alle Erztypen sind mit einer intensiven hydrothermalen Umwandlung der Nebengesteine und der Gangarten verbunden.

Das Vorkommen der Zn-Spinelle in der BÃ¶hmischen Masse,"Zn-Spinelle wurden in der Bohmischen Masse in folgenden Mineralassoziationen festgestellt: peralische Beryllpegmatite, regionalmetamorphe sulfidische, in salischen kristallinen Schiefern vorkommende Zn-Erze, kristalline Kalksteine und rezente Stromsande. Die Zn-Spinelle der Pegmatite sind sehr Mg-arm, so das sie praktisch binare Mischungen des Gahnits und des Herzynits darstellen. Die regionalmetamorphen sulfidischen Zn-Erze in quarzhaltigen kristallinen Schiefern fuhren zinkreiche Spinelle; dies durfte durch die Instabilitat des mit Quarz assoziierten Mg-Spinells unter den Metamorphosebedingungen bedingt sein. In Marmoren und quarzfreien metamorphen Gesteinen variiert die Zusammensetzung der Zn-Spinelle in einem breitem Intervall. Im Kerne der Bohmischen Masse ist in den Stromsanden der Zn-Spinell sehr verbreitet, wahrend er im Erzgebirge sowie in den Sudeten fast ganzlich fehlt (die Nordabhange des Riesengebirges ausgenommen). Die grose Verbreitung der Zn-Spinelle im Kern der Bohmischen Masse ist wahrscheinlich durch den allgemein hohen Zn-Clarc dieses Gebietes bedingt.

Mechanism of focal atrial tachycardias occurring after pulmonary veins isolation,"Introduction: A proarrhythmic consequence of pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) to treat atrial fibrillation can be a persistent left atrial tachycardia (LAT). We previously described that focal LATs can occur; however it is unclear whether the mechanism of these focal arrhythmias is reentry, triggered activity, or abnormal automaticity. We performed detailed pacing and pharmacologic maneuvers to determine the mechanism of focal LATs occurring after PVI. Methods: PVI was performed by segmental ostial ablation guided by a circular mapping catheter (Lasso). Patients whose recurrent arrhythmia was a LAT that persisted for more then 8 weeks returned for mapping and ablation. Results: Of 15 pts with persistent LAT, three (age 66 14, all male) had focal LAT (cycle length 268 21 ms) that remained stable in response to pacing. Electroanatomic maps demonstrated focal areas of early activation at the septal aspect of the right lower (2 pts) or right upper (1 pt) PV. Adenosine caused transient AV block but no change in tachycardia cycle length (TCL). Entrainment from multiple LA sites (N 23) outside the PVs demonstrated long post-pacing-intervals (PPI) (mean PPI-TCL 73 27 ms, range 46-127 ms). Entrainment from multiple poles around the Lasso catheter had a wide range of PPIs (PPI-TCL 22 18 ms, range -3 to 50 ms), suggesting both isthmus sites and sites outside the circuit. Septal Lasso sites and not lateral sites had PPI TCL. A single beat resetting curve in 2 pts demonstrated a mixed flat-increasing curve, consistent with reentry. In one pt, burst atrial pacing terminated and reinitiated the same tachycardia. Recordings at the critical isthmus demonstrated mid diastolic potentials or a long fractionated signal suggesting slow conduction. Ablation at the site of mid diastolic electrograms or best PPI (PPI-TCL 2 6 ms) resulted in LAT termination. Conclusions: Focal left atrial tachycardias may occur after segmental PVI, particularly at the septal aspect of the right pulmonary veins. Detailed entrainment mapping and resetting confirm that the mechanism of the stable tachycardias we studied is reentry. RF application at the critical isthmus results in tachycardia termination.",2005,Heart Rhythm

Robust combination of model selection methods for prediction,"One important goal of regression analysis is prediction. In recent years, the idea of combining different statistical methods has attracted an increasing atten- tion. In this work, we propose a method, l1-ARM (adaptive regression by mixing), to robustly combine model selection methods that performs well adaptively. In numerical work, we consider the LASSO, SCAD, and adaptive LASSO in represen- tative scenarios, as well as in cases of randomly generated models. The l1-ARM automatically performs like the best among them and consequently provides a bet- ter estimation/prediction in an overall sense, especially when outliers are likely to occur.",2012,Statistica Sinica
Quantitative structure-(chromatographic) retention relationship models for dissociating compounds.,"The aim of this work was to develop mathematical models relating the hydrophobicity and dissociation constant of an analyte with its structure, which would be useful in predicting analyte retention times in reversed-phase liquid chromatography. For that purpose a large and diverse group of 115 drugs was used to build three QSRR models combining retention-related parameters (logkw-chromatographic measure of hydrophobicity, S-slope factor from Snyder-Soczewinski equation, and pKa) with structural descriptors calculated by means of molecular modeling for both dissociated and nondissociated forms of analytes. Lasso, Stepwise and PLS regressions were used to build statistical models. Moreover a simple QSRR equations based on lipophilicity and dissociation constant parameters calculated in the ACD/Labs software were proposed and compared with quantum chemistry-based QSRR equations. The obtained relationships were further used to predict chromatographic retention times. The predictive performances of the obtained models were assessed using 10-fold cross-validation and external validation. The QSRR equations developed were simple and were characterized by satisfactory predictive performance. Application of quantum chemistry-based and ACD-based descriptors leads to similar accuracy of retention times' prediction.",2016,Journal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis
Development and validation of an objective risk scoring system for assessing the likelihood of virus introduction in porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus-free sow farms in the US.,"The lack of validated tools to predict how 
long sow farms will remain PRRS virus-free following successful elimination of 
the virus has deterred veterinarians and producers from attempting to eliminate 
the PRRS virus from sow farms. The aim of this study was to use the database of 
PRRS Risk Assessments for the Breeding Herd in PADRAP to develop and validate 
an objective risk scoring system for predicting the likelihood of virus 
introduction in PRRS virus-free sow farms in the US. To overcome the 
challenges of dealing with a large number of variables, group lasso for 
logistic regression (GLLR) was applied to a retrospective dataset of PRRS Risk 
Assessment for the Breeding Herd surveys completed for 704 farms to develop the 
risk scoring system. The validity of the GLLR risk scoring system 
was then evaluated by testing its predictive ability on a dataset from a 
long-term prospective study of 196 sow farms to assess risk factors associated 
with how long PRRS virus-free sow farms remained PRRS virus-free. Receiver 
operator characteristic(ROC) curves were estimated to compare the performance 
of the GLLR risk scoring system to the risk scoring system based on expert 
opinion (EO), currently used in the PRRS Risk Assessment for the Breeding Herd, for 
predicting whether herds remained PRRS virus-free for 130 weeks. The GLLR risk 
scoring system (AUC, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.67 - 0.84) 
performed significantly better than the EO risk scoring system (AUC, 0.36; 95% 
CI, 0.27 - 0.46) for predicting whether to sow farms in the 
prospective study survived for 130 weeks (p 0.001). Dividing 
farms into 3 risk groups (low, medium and high) using a low and high cutoff 
values for the GLLR risk score was informative as the differences in the KM 
survival curves for the 3 groups were both clinically meaningful and 
statistically significant. The GLLR risk scoring system used in conjunction 
with the PRRS Risk Assessment for the Breeding Herd survey delivered through 
PADRAP appears to have the potential to help veterinarians predict the 
likelihood of virus introduction in PRRS virus-free sow farms in the US.",2013,Open Journal of Veterinary Medicine
Serological profile of hepatitis B in children after the introduction of its vaccination in Burkina Faso,"Viral hepatitis B is a public health issue. We establish the children serological profile of hepatitis B in Bobo-Dioulasso, six years after the introduction of hepatitis B vaccine into the Expanded Program on Immunization. This was a descriptive study of prospective data collection carried out in the Department of Pediatrics and the laboratory of virology of the Centre MURAZ of Bobo-Dioulasso between March 2013 and May 2013. Blood samples were made in search of the following hepatitis B serological markers: anti-HBcAb total, HBsAg, Ac anti-HBs, HBeAg, AcHBs, IgM anti-HBc total. The ELISA method with the Monolisa BIORAD reagents was used. A total of 2015 children were included, 1026 (50, 9%) boys and 989 (49.1%) girls, at an average age of 58Â±48 months. Out of these 2015 children, 53 (2.6%) were positive to HBsAg including 19 vaccinated cases, one child has received 3 doses plus 1 booster dose of hepatitis B vaccine. We found no statistically significant difference in the carriage of serologic markers of hepatitis B between the unvaccinated group and the vaccinated group. Large-scale studies should be carried out in Burkina Faso to see the real impact of vaccination on the health of our populations.",2019,Pediatric Reports
Radiomics score: a potential prognostic imaging feature for postoperative survival of solitary HCC patients,"BackgroundRadiomics is an emerging field in oncological research. In this study, we aimed at developing a radiomics score (rad-score) to estimate postoperative recurrence and survival in patients with solitary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).MethodsA total of 319 solitary HCC patients (training cohort: nâ€‰=â€‰212; validation cohort: nâ€‰=â€‰107) were enrolled. Radiomics features were extracted from the artery phase of preoperatively acquired computed tomography (CT) in all patients. A rad-score was generated by using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) logistic model. Kaplan-Meier and Coxâ€™s hazard regression analyses were used to evaluate the prognostic significance of the rad-score. Final nomograms predicting recurrence and survival of solitary HCC patients were established based on the rad-score and clinicopathological factors. C-index and calibration statistics were used to assess the performance of nomograms.ResultsSix potential radiomics features were selected out of 110 texture features to formulate the rad-score. Low rad-score positively correlated with aggressive tumor phenotypes, like larger tumor size and vascular invasion. Meanwhile, low rad-score was significantly associated with increased recurrence and reduced survival. In addition, multivariate analysis identified the rad-score as an independent prognostic factor (recurrence: Hazard ratio (HR): 2.472, 95% confident interval (CI): 1.339â€“4.564, pâ€‰=â€‰0.004;survival: HR: 1.558, 95%CI: 1.022â€“2.375, pâ€‰=â€‰0.039). Notably, the nomogram integrating rad-score had a better prognostic performance as compared with traditional staging systems. These results were further confirmed in the validation cohort.ConclusionsThe preoperative CT image based rad-score was an independent prognostic factor for the postoperative outcome of solitary HCC patients. This score may be complementary to the current staging system and help to stratify individualized treatments for solitary HCC patients.",2018,BMC Cancer
How News Organizations Paraphrase Their Stories on Social Media? Computational Text Analysis Approach,"Social media has become one of major sources of news. As information overload prevails, news organizations need to form social media strategies to reach news readersâ€™ limited attention (Lanham, 2006; Anderson & de Palma, 2013). This study aims to investigate one of news organizationsâ€™ potential strategies â€“ paraphrasing a news story on a social media post. 
Previous literature on the choice of news headlines found that commercial news media relying on advertising for their revenue tend to frame their news story as sensational in its headline (Reah 1998; Molek-Kozakowska, 2013). Similarly, recent studies on search engine optimization (SEO) show that news media carefully choose titles and keywords tagged in URL and HTML to maximize chances for their stories to be searched online monitoring their competitors (Dick, 2011). If these strategies are effective, news organizations are likely to adopt a similar strategy on social media. In particular, they may paraphrase their news information to make it: 
(a) concise enough to fit into a text limit on a social media platform, 
(b) informative enough to signal news content, 
(c) and appealing to the news demand. 
This strategy can influence news readersâ€™ perception of a news topic because news consumption via social media tends to be relatively instant and less-lasting (Mitchell, Jurkowitz & Olmstead, 2014). Many news readers may learn about a news topic from a social media post rather than an original news story, as they used to do with headlines and leads of traditional news (Andrew, 2007). This implies that how news organizations paraphrase news for social media may frame news readersâ€™ perception of a public issue. 
To reveal news organizationsâ€™ paraphrasing strategy, I apply computational information retrieval and text analysis methods. Previous studies based on hand-coding approaches often analyze only social media posts (Newman, 2011) due to the large amount of data from social media posts themselves, original news articles and relationships between the two. This approach targets only information after paraphrasing, but does not allow for looking at how the paraphrase is related to the original text. Instead, I crawled news articles from 117 news organizationsâ€™ websites and their official Twitter accounts for a week (Feb 27, 2017â€“Mar 5, 2017), which amount to 13,773 news stories and 61,219 tweets. Also, I could identify news articles shared in each social media post matching URLs from an article and from a tweet. 
I analyze how news organizations paraphrase their news articles by looking at which word in an original text is likely to make it on a social media post. This task can be carried out by discriminating words algorithms such as Logistic Lasso regression (Mitra & Gilbert, 2014) or Multinomial Inverse regression (Taddy, 2013) recently developed in statistics and machine learning fields. Unlike popular dictionary methods such as LIWC, these algorithms allow for words likely to be in a social media post to emerge as an outcome of the empirical analysis without pre-assigning psychological meanings to dictionary words.",2017,
In silico genomic mining reveals unexplored bioactive potential of rare actinobacteria isolated from Egyptian soil,"BackgroundAntibiotic resistance occurs rapidly and naturally. However, the misuse of antibiotics is accelerating the process. And therefore, exploring new antibiotics has been a great demand in order to save peopleâ€™s life. Actinobacteria have been the major source of antibiotics. In this study, we focused on rare types of actinobacteria which are hard to isolate from the environment by traditional methods. Fifty rare actinobacteria were isolated from Egyptian soils, and they were screened against some bacterial pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 10145, Klebsiella pneumonia CCM 4415, Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175, Escherichia coli O157:H7 ATCC 51659, and Salmonella enterica ATCC 25566). Illumina whole genome sequencing was performed for potent isolates. The whole genomes of selected rare actinobacteria were investigated via bioinformatics analysis using neighbor-joining phylogenetic analysis and Antibiotics and Secondary Metabolite Analysis SHell.ResultsIsolates Rc5 and Ru87 showed the highest inhibition activity against selected Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens. Neighbor-joining phylogenetic analysis confirmed that isolate Rc5 belonged to Micromonospora oryzae and Micromonospora harpali with 73% bootstrap value while isolate Ru87 was grouped with Streptomyces gingianensis and Streptomyces morales with 89% bootstrap value. Bioinformatics analysis using antiSMASH 3.0 predicted 33 and 19 secondary metabolite gene clusters in Micromonospora sp. Rc5 and Streptomyces sp. Ru87, respectively. Gene annotation predicted the presence of valuable biosynthetic gene clusters in both strains such as polyketides, non-ribosomal peptides, terpenes, siderophores, bacteriocin, lasso peptide, ectoine, and lantipeptide.ConclusionWe concluded that exploring cryptic and novel biosynthetic gene clusters via Illumina whole genome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis is a useful method. We confirmed that Egyptian soil is very rich in high potential biosynthetic of rare actinobacteria. Further genetic engineering manipulation of biosynthetic pathways would eventually lead to producing novel bioactive molecules.",2019,Bulletin of the National Research Centre
Resolving Transition Metal Chemical Space: Feature Selection for Machine Learning and Structure-Property Relationships.,"Machine learning (ML) of quantum mechanical properties shows promise for accelerating chemical discovery. For transition metal chemistry where accurate calculations are computationally costly and available training data sets are small, the molecular representation becomes a critical ingredient in ML model predictive accuracy. We introduce a series of revised autocorrelation functions (RACs) that encode relationships of the heuristic atomic properties (e.g., size, connectivity, and electronegativity) on a molecular graph. We alter the starting point, scope, and nature of the quantities evaluated in standard ACs to make these RACs amenable to inorganic chemistry. On an organic molecule set, we first demonstrate superior standard AC performance to other presently available topological descriptors for ML model training, with mean unsigned errors (MUEs) for atomization energies on set-aside test molecules as low as 6 kcal/mol. For inorganic chemistry, our RACs yield 1 kcal/mol ML MUEs on set-aside test molecules in spin-state splitting in comparison to 15-20Ã— higher errors for feature sets that encode whole-molecule structural information. Systematic feature selection methods including univariate filtering, recursive feature elimination, and direct optimization (e.g., random forest and LASSO) are compared. Random-forest- or LASSO-selected subsets 4-5Ã— smaller than the full RAC set produce sub- to 1 kcal/mol spin-splitting MUEs, with good transferability to metal-ligand bond length prediction (0.004-5 Ã… MUE) and redox potential on a smaller data set (0.2-0.3 eV MUE). Evaluation of feature selection results across property sets reveals the relative importance of local, electronic descriptors (e.g., electronegativity, atomic number) in spin-splitting and distal, steric effects in redox potential and bond lengths.",2017,The journal of physical chemistry.

Preventing Heterotopic Ossification in Combat Casualtiesâ€”Which Models Are Best Suited for Clinical Use?,"BackgroundTo prevent symptomatic heterotopic ossification (HO) and guide primary prophylaxis in patients with combat wounds, physicians require risk stratification methods that can be used early in the postinjury period. There are no validated models to help guide clinicians in the treatment for this common and potentially disabling condition.Questions/purposesWe developed three prognostic models designed to estimate the likelihood of wound-specific HO formation and compared them using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and decision curve analysis (DCA) to determine (1) which model is most accurate; and (2) which technique is best suited for clinical use.MethodsWe obtained muscle biopsies from 87 combat wounds during the first dÃ©bridement in the United States, all of which were evaluated radiographically for development of HO at a minimum of 2Â months postinjury. The criterion for determining the presence of HO was the ability to see radiographic evidence of ectopic bone formation within the zone of injury. We then quantified relative gene expression from 190 wound healing, osteogenic, and vascular genes. Using these data, we developed an Artificial Neural Network, Random Forest, and a Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) Logistic Regression model designed to estimate the likelihood of eventual wound-specific HO formation. HO was defined as any HO visible on the plain film within the zone of injury. We compared the models accuracy using area under the ROC curve (area under the curve [AUC]) as well as DCA to determine which model, if any, was better suited for clinical use. In general, the AUC compares models based solely on accuracy, whereas DCA compares their clinical utility after weighing the consequences of under- or overtreatment of a particular disorder.ResultsBoth the Artificial Neural Network and the LASSO logistic regression models were relatively accurate with AUCs of 0.78 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72â€“0.83) and 0.75 (95% CI, 0.71â€“0.78), respectively. The Random Forest model returned an AUC of only 0.53 (95% CI, 0.48â€“0.59), marginally better than chance alone. Using DCA, the Artificial Neural Network model demonstrated the highest net benefit over the broadest range of threshold probabilities, indicating that it is perhaps better suited for clinical use than the LASSO logistic regression model. Specifically, if only patients with greater than 25% risk of developing HO received prophylaxis, for every 100 patients, use of the Artificial Network Model would result in six fewer patients who unnecessarily receive prophylaxis compared with using the LASSO regression model while not missing any patients who might benefit from it.ConclusionsOur findings suggest that it is possible to risk-stratify combat wounds with regard to eventual HO formation early in the dÃ©bridement process. Using these data, the Artificial Neural Network model may lead to better patient selection when compared with the LASSO logistic regression approach. Future prospective studies are necessary to validate these findings while focusing on symptomatic HO as the endpoint of interest.Level of EvidenceLevel III, prognostic study.",2015,Clinical Orthopaedics and Related ResearchÂ®
"Mittelfristiges, relativ tumorstabiles Outcome eines erfolgreich interdisziplinÃ¤r lokal R0-resezierten, metastasierten Leiomyosarkoms der V. cava inferior mit multimodaler Behandlung","ZusammenfassungFortgeschrittenes Tumorwachstum muss nicht automatisch Nihilismus bedeuten, da mit den gegenwÃ¤rtigen multimodalen Therapieoptionen durchaus in AbhÃ¤ngigkeit von TumorentitÃ¤t, Befundkonstellation und Behandlerexpertise im ausgewÃ¤hlten Fall aussichtsreiche BehandlungsansÃ¤tze bestehen kÃ¶nnen, deren AusschÃ¶pfung die heutige interdisziplinÃ¤re Onkochirurgie/Onkologie gelegentlich bis hin zur Schwelle einer chronisch zu nennenden Tumorerkrankung zu leisten vermag. Das Ziel des fallassoziierten Reports besteht darin, die spezifischen patienten-, behandlungs-, verlaufs- und prognosebezogenen Aspekte von aufeinanderfolgenden multimodalen (operativ, radiologisch-interventionell & onkologisch-chemotherapeutisch) TherapieansÃ¤tzen eines initial erfolgreich interdisziplinÃ¤r (allgemein-, gefÃ¤ÃŸ-, viszeral- & spÃ¤terhin neurochirurgisch) lokal (caval & hepatisch) R0-resezierten, hepatisch & pulmonal (spÃ¤terhin vertebral) metastasierten Leiomyosarkoms der V. cava inferior darzustellen, die letztlich in einem mittelfristigen, relativ tumorstabilen Outcome resultierten.Eine 54-jÃ¤hrige Frau mit einem Leiomyosarkom der V. cava inferior wurde im initial bereits metastasierten Stadium erfolgreich lokal operativ mit Resektion und Ersatz einer Cavaprothese sowie simultaner Hemihepatektomie rechts und Resektion des Leber-Segmentes I versorgt. Die Weiterbehandlung erfolgte multimodalinterdisziplinÃ¤r, wobei mehrere systemische Chemotherapien, eine Thermoablation der Lebermetastasierung, wiederholte Brachytherapien (sowohl der Leber- als auch der pulmonalen Metastasen) sowie die Resektion mit anschlieÃŸender Bestrahlung einer Hirnmetastase durch die Neurochirurgie zum Einsatz kamen.
 Schlussfolgerungen Es konnte gezeigt werden, dass auch bei initial bereits metastasiertem Stadium ein mittelfristig stabiles Outcome trotz eines nicht komplikationslosen Verlaufes mit akzeptabler LebensqualitÃ¤t mÃ¶glich ist. Dieses selten in der Literatur beschriebene Krankheitsbild eines fortgeschrittenen Leiomyosarkoms wurde in einem Zeitraum von 5 Jahren und 6 Monaten beobachtet.SummaryProgredient tumor-growth does not mean necessarily nihilism since (because of the latest multimodal therapeutic options) it might be possible to convert the malignant disease into a chronic stage depending on tumor entity, specific tumor-associated findings and expertise of the interdisciplinary oncological/oncosurgical team to utilize available and potential therapeutic measures.The aim of this report on an unusual case (with its patient-associated, therapeutic and prognostic aspects) of a leiomyosarcoma of the inferior vena cava with advanced tumor growth (characterized initially by pulmonary and hepatic, later on by additional vertebral metastases) is to illustrate its changeful clinical course after and during multimodal treatment episodes comprising surgical (abdomino-/vascular-/cardio- and neurosurgicalâ€”locally, R0 resection status), radiological and chemotherapeutic measures. A relatively stable disease over a specific time period of 5 years and 6 months was achieved. The 54-year old female patient with metastasized leiomyosarcoma of the inferior vena cava underwent local tumor resection en bloc with inferior vena cava segmental resection (following vascularsurgical interposition of a prosthesis) and hemihepatectomy as well as resection of hepatic segment I. After recovery, a multistep and -modal treatment was initiated comprising of various protocols of systemic chemotherapy, thermoablation of recurrent hepatic metastases, various brachytherapy procedures (for hepatic and pulmonary metastases) and resection of a cerebral metastasis by a neurosurgeon including subsequent radiation.
 Conclusions The patient demonstrates impressively that even in case of advanced tumor stage with initial, novel and recurrent metastases, a relatively stable disease over an intermediate time period (of more than 5 years) with an acceptable quality of life was achieved despite several complications.",2012,Wiener Medizinische Wochenschrift
Modeling tumor evolutionary dynamics to predict clinical outcomes for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer: a retrospective analysis.,"Over 50% of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients develop resistance after a transient response to therapy. Understanding tumor resistance from an evolutionary perspective leads to better predictions of treatment outcomes. The objectives of this study were to develop a computational framework to analyze tumor longitudinal measurements and recapitulate the individual evolutionary dynamics in metastatic CRC (mCRC) patients. A stochastic modeling framework was developed to depict the whole spectrum of tumor evolution prior to diagnosis and during and after therapy. The evolutionary model was optimized using a non-linear mixed effect (NLME) method based on the longitudinal measurements of liver metastatic lesions from 599 mCRC patients. The deterministic limits in the NLME model were applied to optimize the stochastic model for each patient. Cox proportional hazards models coupled with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm were applied to predict patients' progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). The stochastic evolutionary model well described the longitudinal profiles of tumor sizes. The evolutionary parameters optimized for each patient indicated substantial inter-patient variability. The number of resistant subclones at diagnosis was found to be a significant predictor to survival, and the hazard ratios with 95% CI were 1.09 [0.79-1.49] and 1.54 [1.01-2.34] for patients with three or more resistant subclones. Coupled with several patient characteristics, evolutionary parameters strongly predict patients' PFS and OS. In conclusion, a stochastic computational framework was successfully developed to recapitulate individual patient evolutionary dynamics, which could predict clinical survival outcomes in mCRC patients.",2019,Cancer research
3.2 Regularization Methods for Categorical Predictors,The majority of regularization methods in regression analysis has been designed for metric predictors and can not be used for categorical predictors.

Which bridge estimator is optimal for variable selection?,"We study the problem of variable selection for linear models under the high-dimensional asymptotic setting, where the number of observations $n$ grows at the same rate as the number of predictors $p$. We consider two-stage variable selection techniques (TVS) in which the first stage uses bridge estimators to obtain an estimate of the regression coefficients, and the second stage simply thresholds this estimate to select the ""important"" predictors. The asymptotic false discovery proportion (AFDP) and true positive proportion (ATPP) of these TVS are evaluated. We prove that for a fixed ATPP, in order to obtain a smaller AFDP, one should pick a bridge estimator with smaller asymptotic mean square error in the first stage of TVS. Based on such principled discovery, we present a sharp comparison of different TVS, via an in-depth investigation of the estimation properties of bridge estimators. Rather than ""order-wise"" error bounds with loose constants, our analysis focuses on precise error characterization. Various interesting signal-to-noise ratio and sparsity settings are studied. Our results offer new and thorough insights into high-dimensional variable selection. For instance, we prove that a TVS with Ridge in its first stage outperforms TVS with other bridge estimators in large noise settings; two-stage LASSO becomes inferior when the signal is rare and weak. As a by-product, we show that two-stage methods outperform some standard variable selection techniques, such as LASSO and Sure Independence Screening, under certain conditions.",2017,ArXiv
"Commentary on ""Discretion, Rules and Volatility","D iscussions of rules vs. discretion have occupied a central place in the analysis of macroeconomic policies in dynamic models. Costas Azariadis and Vincenzo Galasso have presented a new model that shows how a discretionary policy regime can lead to a more volatile fiscal policy than one pursued under a constitutional rule. They set up a simple fiscal policy story and examine the potential for discretionary policy to produce cyclical or chaotic dynamics that they regard as a volatile outcome. I discuss their results by reasoning with analogy to games of tacit cooperation and bargaining. In particular, I argue that some classical insights of Thomas Schelling can help us understand the reason discretionary policies in the Azariadis and Galasso model can generate multiple equilibria and the appearance of a random fiscal policy, whereas a regime of rules does not. The Azariadis and Galasso model is based on the simplest overlapping generations model. The only policy variable in their framework is the choice of a social security transfer payment from the young generation to the old generation. Their model of discretionary policy is the determination of the level of the transfer by a median voter or majoritarian voting arrangement. Because the median voter can costlessly change the transfer at each time, this is a discretionary regime. This model has multiple equilibria that reflects a fundamental indeterminacy problem. Some of these equilibria can also be dynamically inefficient, although they are all individually rational and satisfy a subgame perfection constraint. Volatility takes the form of a potentially cyclic or chaotic transfer sequence. Fiscal policy can appear to be random even though it is generated by a deterministic dynamic process. In contrast, Azariadis and Galasso show that the constitutional rule produces a different result. The indeterminacy problem disappears, and the resulting equilibrium profile is dynamically efficient.",1997,
Barns religionsfrihet i fÃ¶rskolan : En kvalitativ intervjustudie,"AbstractMany opinions are divided on what religious freedom should protect and the area is unexploredin preschool. Is it the parents, the child or preschool teacher right? The aim of the studywas to investigate Maria klasson SundinÂ´s concept and theoretical models of religious freedomfor children through three Swedish preschool settings and also how three teachers interpretsand expresses children's freedom of religion. Through a qualitative interview study theaim was to investigate how the concepts of religion, autonomy and freedom is interpreted andexpressed by the teachers so a picture through this three concepts can categorise the teachersin a model; freedom of thought, tradition and life interpretation model so a broader picturecan be made to understand how the children's freedom of religion is expressed in the preschoolsetting and how the teachers work. The Result showed through the analysis that themodels fail to categorise the teachers in any theoretical model but on the other hand the understandingof preschool teacherâ€™s expression and interpretation of the concept of religion,autonomy and freedom showed both diversity and lack of knowledge on the subject mattersreligious freedom which fall within the child rights issues. Furthermore the analysis showsthat children in preschool lack religious freedom, it can be interpreted rather in terms of afreedom of parents and preschool teachers. Further research is needed in the area of children'srights and religious freedom for preschool children and their teachers in (e.g.) investigate differenceof public municipal and private preschools, religious, and non-religious.",2014,
The new LassoLoop360Â° technique for biomechanically superior tissue grip,"Suprapectoral tenodesis is a frequently used technique for treating pathologies of the long head of the biceps brachii (LHBB) tendon. However, so far, no Gold Standard treatment exist. Hence, the arthroscopic LassoLoop360 (LL360) technique is introduced aiming to provide secure fixation and improved biomechanical properties. It was hypothesized, that the LL360 technique would show superior biomechanical response to cyclic loading and ultimate load-to-failure testing compared to the commonly used simple Lasso Loop (SLL). Twenty-two porcine superficial flexor digitorum tendons were prepared using a No. 2 suture according to either the SLL or the LL360 technique. Displacement after cyclic loading (1.000 cycles) between 5 and 30 N, ultimate load-to-failure (ULTF), mode of failure as well as the construct stiffness were tested. Significantly less displacement was found in the LL360 group (SLL 2.25â€‰Â±â€‰0.51 mm; LL360 1.67â€‰Â±â€‰0.37 mm; pâ€‰=â€‰0.01). Ultimate Load to Failure was significantly higher in the LL360 (168.6â€‰Â±â€‰29.6 N) as compared to the SLL (124.1â€‰Â±â€‰25.8 N, pâ€‰=â€‰0.02). The LL360 also revealed a significant higher stiffness compared to the SLL (SLL 13.1â€‰Â±â€‰0.9 N/mm vs. LL360 19.1â€‰Â±â€‰1.0 N/mm, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). The most common mode of failure was the suture cutting through the tendon, with a significantly less suture cutting through for the LL360 compared with the SLL (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). The LassoLoop360-technique offers superior biomechanical characteristics regarding the tendon-suture-interface compared to the SLL. In the initial healing phase, the suture-tendon-interface is the most vulnerable part of the tendon-suture-anchor construct, the aim of this new technique is to reduce this weakest part of the chain (Ponce et al., Am J Sports Med 39:188â€“194, 2011). This technique may therefore be beneficial for arthroscopic suprapectoral biceps tenodesis at the entrance of the bicipital groove.",2019,"Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy"

Abstract 774: Proteogenomic characterization of high-grade serous ovarian cancer,"High grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) is a highly lethal gynecological malignancy, in large part because most patients develop resistance to the standard of care chemotherapy with platinum and taxanes. We performed deep proteomic and phosphoproteomic characterization on ovarian high-grade serous carcinomas (HGSC) previously characterized genomically by the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) as part of the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC; http://proteomics.cancer.gov/programs/cptacnetwork). We constructed an integrated proteogenomic landscape of HGSC and identified functional modules statistically associated with outcomes including platinum resistance and overall survival. Integration of genomic data such as copy number alterations (CNA) with global protein abundance data revealed several chromosomal regions that have significant trans effects on protein expression. These genetically affected proteins were used to construct statistical models capable of predicting survival outcomes. Trans-affected proteins were enriched in proliferation, cell motility and invasion, and immune regulation, hallmarks of cancer. We used statistical methods to identify functional pathways able to discriminate between short surviving and long surviving patients. We found that protein abundance and phosphorylation indicated pathway activity that was able to clearly discriminate between these two groups, but that transcriptional expression and CNAs were not. We integrated proteomic abundance and phosphorylation state to elucidate specific signaling interactions and pathways differentially active in tumors from patients with short overall survival as well as to predict novel kinase substrate relationships important in HGSC. Finally, we identified druggable pathways that are differentially active across proteomic subtypes. A key point arising from our multimodal analysis is that combining different types of molecular data from these tumors greatly increases the ability to identify biologically relevant differences between groups. Using a Lasso-based regression approach to integrate data we show that the most robustly predictive survival models can be obtained using integrated CNA, transcriptome, proteome, and phosphoproteome data than with any of the individual sources of data.

"Intravenous lidocaine and postoperative bowel motility in laparotomies for generalized acute peritonitis: double-blind randomized clinical trial at souro-sanou teaching hospital in Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso","Reducing the duration of postoperative paralytic ileus remains a major challenge for anesthetists in digestive surgery.

Measuring associations between the microbiota and repeated measures of continuous clinical variables using a lasso-penalized generalized linear mixed model,"BackgroundHuman microbiome studies in clinical settings generally focus on distinguishing the microbiota in health from that in disease at a specific point in time. However, microbiome samples may be associated with disease severity or continuous clinical health indicators that are often assessed at multiple time points. While the temporal data from clinical and microbiome samples may be informative, analysis of this type of data can be problematic for standard statistical methods.ResultsTo identify associations between microbiota and continuous clinical variables measured repeatedly in two studies of the respiratory tract, we adapted a statistical method, the lasso-penalized generalized linear mixed model (LassoGLMM). LassoGLMM can screen for associated clinical variables, incorporate repeated measures of individuals, and address the large number of species found in the microbiome. As is common in microbiome studies, when the number of variables is an order of magnitude larger than the number of samples LassoGLMM can be imperfect in its variable selection. We overcome this limitation by adding a pre-screening step to reduce the number of variables evaluated in the model. We assessed the use of this adapted two-stage LassoGLMM for its ability to determine which microbes are associated with continuous repeated clinical measures.We found associations (retaining a non-zero coefficient in the LassoGLMM) between 10 laboratory measurements and 43 bacterial genera in the oral microbiota, and between 2 cytokines and 3 bacterial genera in the lung. We compared our associations with those identified by the Wilcoxon test after dichotomizing our outcomes and identified a non-significant trend towards differential abundance between high and low outcomes. Our two-step LassoGLMM explained more of the variance seen in the outcome of interest than other variants of the LassoGLMM method.ConclusionsWe demonstrated a method that can account for the large number of genera detected in microbiome studies and repeated measures of clinical or longitudinal studies, allowing for the detection of strong associations between microbes and clinical measures. By incorporating the design strengths of repeated measurements and a prescreening step to aid variable selection, our two-step LassoGLMM will be a useful analytic method for investigating relationships between microbes and repeatedly measured continuous outcomes.",2018,BioData Mining
â„“1-penalization for mixture regression models,"We consider a finite mixture of regressions (FMR) model for high-dimensional inhomogeneous data where the number of covariates may be much larger than sample size. We propose an â„“1-penalized maximum likelihood estimator in an appropriate parameterization. This kind of estimation belongs to a class of problems where optimization and theory for non-convex functions is needed. This distinguishes itself very clearly from high-dimensional estimation with convex loss- or objective functions as, for example, with the Lasso in linear or generalized linear models. Mixture models represent a prime and important example where non-convexity arises.For FMR models, we develop an efficient EM algorithm for numerical optimization with provable convergence properties. Our penalized estimator is numerically better posed (e.g., boundedness of the criterion function) than unpenalized maximum likelihood estimation, and it allows for effective statistical regularization including variable selection. We also present some asymptotic theory and oracle inequalities: due to non-convexity of the negative log-likelihood function, different mathematical arguments are needed than for problems with convex losses. Finally, we apply the new method to both simulated and real data.",2010,TEST
Statistical Tests for Optimization Efficiency,"Learning problems, such as logistic regression, are typically formulated as pure optimization problems defined on some loss function. We argue that this view ignores the fact that the loss function depends on stochastically generated data which in turn determines an intrinsic scale of precision for statistical estimation. By considering the statistical properties of the update variables used during the optimization (e.g. gradients), we can construct frequentist hypothesis tests to determine the reliability of these updates. We utilize subsets of the data for computing updates, and use the hypothesis tests for determining when the batch-size needs to be increased. This provides computational benefits and avoids overfitting by stopping when the batch-size has become equal to size of the full dataset. Moreover, the proposed algorithms depend on a single interpretable parameter -the probability for an update to be in the wrong direction - which is set to a single value across all algorithms and datasets. In this paper, we illustrate these ideas on three L1 regularized coordinate descent algorithms: L1-regularized L2-loss SVMs, L1-regularized logistic regression, and the Lasso, but we emphasize that the underlying methods are much more generally applicable.",2011,
Dried blood spot HIV-1 RNA quantification using open real-time systems in South Africa and Burkina Faso.,"There is an urgent need to assess the accuracy/feasibility of using dried blood spots (DBS) for monitoring of HIV-1 viral load in resource-limited settings. A total of 892 DBS from HIV-1-positive pregnant women and their neonates enrolled in the Kesho Bora prevention of mother-to-child transmission trial conducted in Durban (South Africa) and Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina Faso) between May 2005 and July 2008 were tested for HIV-1 RNA. The combination Nuclisens extraction method (BioMÃ©rieux)/Generic HIV Viral Load assay (Biocentric) was performed using one DBS (in Durban) versus 2 DBS (in Bobo-Dioulasso) on 2 distinct open real-time polymerase chain reaction instruments. DBS HIV-1 RNA results were compared with plasma HIV-1 RNA and HIV serology results used as the gold standards. The limits of detection of assays on DBS were 3100 and 1550 copies per milliliter in Durban and Bobo-Dioulasso, respectively. DBS HIV-1 RNA values correlated significantly with plasma levels (n = 327; R = 0.7351) and were uniformly distributed according to duration of DBS storage at -20Â°C (median duration, 280 days). For early infant diagnosis, the sensitivity and specificity were 100% (95% confidence interval: 97.2 to 100.0 and 96.5 to 100.0, respectively). HIV-1 viral load kinetics in DNase-pretreated DBS were similar to those obtained in plasma specimens among 13 patients receiving antiretroviral treatment. HIV-1 RNA findings from serial infant DBS collected prospectively (n = 164) showed 100% concordance with HIV serology at 18 months of life. Our findings strongly advocate the implementation of DBS HIV-1 RNA testing in remote areas from low-income and middle-income countries.",2010,Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes
Ultrasound radimoics nomogram for predicting lymph node metastasis in papillary thyroid carcinoma,"Objective To establish an ultrasound (US) radimoics nomogram for predicting central neck lymph node metastasis (LNM) in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Method A training cohort of 300 patients and validation cohort of 143 patients were established from January to December 2017. US radiomics score was built by using radiomics to analyze ultrasound image of PTC lesion. A nomogram was established by logistic regression from selection of gender, age, thyroglobulin (TG), thyroglobulin antibodies (TGAB), thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAB), US radiomics score and US report LNM status. C-index was calculated to evaluate discrimination of this nomogram. Also, calibration curve was drawn to evaluate calibration of it. Results The positive rates of LNM in two cohorts were 29.7% and 34.6%, respectively. In this study, 23 predictive US radiomics features (26:1) were screened out from 609 cases in the training set, which were nonzero coefficients in the LASSO logistic regression model. US radiomics score yield a C-index of 0.802 (95% CI, 0.791 to 0.815) in training cohort and 0.809 (95% CI, 0.801 to 0.816). Through binary logistic regression, indexes were filtered as age, TPOAB, US radiomics score and US report LNM status. The area under curve, accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of this nomogram was 0.801, 0.812, 0.628 and 0861, respectively, from validation cohort. The C-index was 0.811 (95% CI, 0.804 to 0.818).

Generalized Sparse Regularization with Application to fMRI Brain Decoding,"Many current medical image analysis problems involve learning thousands or even millions of model parameters from extremely few samples. Employing sparse models provides an effective means for handling the curse of dimensionality, but other propitious properties beyond sparsity are typically not modeled. In this paper, we propose a simple approach, generalized sparse regularization (GSR), for incorporating domain-specific knowledge into a wide range of sparse linear models, such as the LASSO and group LASSO regression models. We demonstrate the power of GSR by building anatomically-informed sparse classifiers that additionally model the intrinsic spatiotemporal characteristics of brain activity for fMRI classification. We validate on real data and show how prior-informed sparse classifiers outperform standard classifiers, such as SVM and a number of sparse linear classifiers, both in terms of prediction accuracy and result interpretability. Our results illustrate the added-value in facilitating flexible integration of prior knowledge beyond sparsity in large-scale model learning problems.",2011,Information processing in medical imaging : proceedings of the ... conference
Total Variation Regularization Enhances Regression-Based Brain Activity Prediction,"While medical imaging typically provides massive amounts of data, the automatic extraction of relevant information in a given applicative context remains a difficult challenge in general. With functional MRI (fMRI), the data provide an indirect measurement of brain activity, that can be related to behavioral information. It is now standard to formulate this relation as a machine learning problem where the signal from the entire brain is used to predict a target, typically a behavioral variable. In order to cope with the high dimensionality of the data, the learning method requires a regularization procedure. Among other alternatives, l1 regularization achieves simultaneously a selection of the most predictive features. One limitation of the latter method, also referred to as Lasso in the case of regression, is that the spatial structure of the image is not taken into account, so that the extracted features are often hard to interpret. To obtain more informative and interpretable results, we propose to use the l1 norm of the image radient, a.k.a., the Total Variation (TV), as regularization. TV extracts few predictive regions with piecewise constant weights over the whole brain, and is thus more consistent with traditional brain mapping. We show on real fMRI data that this method yields more accurate predictions in inter-subject analysis compared to voxel-based reference methods, such as Elastic net or Support Vector Regression.",2010,2010 First Workshop on Brain Decoding: Pattern Recognition Challenges in Neuroimaging

The occurrence of these parasites was not limited to a specific area only. The two groups of parasites were found infecting the body of copepods. The first group is called Ellobiopsis chattoni and the second group is called Thalassomyces sp. which were found infecting many copepods namely Paracalanus aculeatus , Paracalanus crassirostris , Acartia danae , Temora discaudata . The infected organisms were found in reduced size, hence the biomass of plankton was also found less than that of the non infected copepods but the overall biodiversity of marine organisms were not found affected during the infection period.",2003,Journal of Arid Environments

Sparse Variable Selection on High Dimensional Heterogeneous Data with Tree Structured Responses,"We consider the problem of sparse variable selection on high dimension heterogeneous data sets, which has been taken on renewed interest recently due to the growth of biological and medical data sets with complex, non-i.i.d. structures and prolific response variables. The heterogeneity is likely to confound the association between explanatory variables and responses, resulting in a wealth of false discoveries when Lasso or its variants are na\""ively applied. Therefore, the research interest of developing effective confounder correction methods is growing. However, ordinarily employing recent confounder correction methods will result in undesirable performance due to the ignorance of the convoluted interdependency among the prolific response variables. To fully improve current variable selection methods, we introduce a model that can utilize the dependency information from multiple responses to select the active variables from heterogeneous data. Through extensive experiments on synthetic and real data sets, we show that our proposed model outperforms the existing methods.",2017,arXiv: Methodology

Evaluating the capabilities of Sentinel-2 and Tetracam RGB+3 for multi-temporal detection of thrips on capsicum,"Various pests and diseases can deteriorate the quality and yield of the capsicum. In order to control these losses, their timely detection is important. Thrips is one of the major pests in capsicum which is unable to detect in initial phase as the symptoms are not visible to naked eyes. Thrips not only causes plant damage but for the serious plant diseases it vectors. In this paper, we address the problem of detection of low infestation of thrips on capsicum leaves using multi-temporal hyperspectral remote sensing data simulated to multispectral sensors such as Sentinel-2 and Tetracam RGB+3. The reectance data from capsicum leaves with healthy and low infestations of thrips has been collected using handheld spectroradiometer. The hyperspectral remote sensing data is collected from 213 bands with wavelength ranging from 350 nm to 1052 nm and bandwidth varying from 3.22 nm to 3.346 nm during the period of 17 Mar to 13 Apr 2017. Variations observed in the spectral reflectance over time makes the detection based on multi-temporal data difficult. We have evaluated the performance of tuned random forest classifier for various set of features such as full feature set of 213 bands, features selected by Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) from 213 bands, features simulated to broad bands similar to Sentinel 2 and features simulated to multispectral bands similar to Tetracam RGB+3 (a camera which can be placed on drones). Results suggests that an overall classification accuracy of 92.81 % has been achieved on validation dataset using full feature set whereas accuracy slightly dips down to 90.3, 85.13 and 87.45 % when using selected features by LASSO, bands simulated to Sentinel-2 and Tetracam-RGB+3 respectively. Results imply that, Tetracam-RGB+3 and Sentinel-2 satellite can be effectively used for detection of low-infestation of thrips on capsicum.",2018,

En canvi, si que hem detectat una clara associacio de V600E amb lhipermetilacio de MLH1. A mes, analitzant els mateixos tumors per la metilacio dels gens p16, p14, RASSF1A, APC, MGMT i THBS1 hem associat BRAF-V600E i lhipermetilacio de MLH1 a un estat dhipermetilacio genomica. Duna altra banda, no hem trobat cap associacio de BRAF amb cap caracteristica clinico-patologica a excepcio de la localitzacio ja que BRAF-V600E es detecta significativament en els casos proximals. Tambe hem analitzat casos de CCR de pacients HNPCC, que tenen MSI per mutacions germinals enlloc de per metilacio. No hem detectat cap mutacio V600E de BRAF en aquests tumors, tant si tenen mutacions germinals a MLH1, MSH2 o MSH6 o no tenen mutacio coneguda pero compleixen criteris clinics com els dAmsterdam o els de Bethesda mes estrictes. Aixo confirma que V600E no es dona especificament als casos MSI sino en els casos amb hipermetilacio de MLH1, i que aquests solen tenir mes metilacio genomica que la resta de tumors.
Apart, tambe hem analitzat KRAS en casos de CCR MSS, MSI esporadics amb i sense hipermetilacio de MLH1 i HNPCC. Aixi, la frequencia de mutacions a KRAS es mes alta si no hi ha hipermetilacio de MLH1, independentment del seu origen esporadic o hereditari. No obstant, en els casos esporadics aquestes mutacions afecten sobretot al codo 12 mentre que en els casos hereditaris afecten al codo 12 i al 13 equitativament. A mes, els casos HNPCC amb mutacio a MLH1 tenen una frequencia de mutacions a KRAS menor que si la mutacio germinal te lloc a MSH2 o MSH6. Finalment, les diferencies mutacionals de KRAS i BRAF en CCR esporadic i hereditari suggereixen una modulacio diferent de la via Ras-Raf-MAPK aixi com una possible activacio daltres vies moleculars alternatives depenent de lestat en que es trobi el fons genetic i epigenetic del tumor. A mes, labsencia total de la mutacio V600E de BRAF a HNPCC la converteix en una eina fiable, rapida i de baix cost per al diagnostic molecular com a criteri dexclusio de cancer familiar.
"" SUMMARY:
The Ras-Raf-MAPK pathway regulates functions such as cell proliferation, transformation and apoptosis. In cancer activating mutations are present in the three Ras genes (KRAS, HRAS and NRAS) and in one Raf gene (BRAF). Moreover, Ras and Raf mutations hardly ever are found together in the same tumor suggesting that they activate the same pathway. In colorectal cancer (CRC) the BRAF hotspot mutation V600E is associated to microsatellite instability (MSI), which is characterised by insertion/deletion mutations in repetitive sequences. Here we have determined possible molecular or clinico-pathological associations of V600E to understand its higher tumorogenic capabilities in this subset of tumors.
We found that BRAF was not mutated in gastric cancer with MSI or without (MSS), although gastric and colorectal MSI tumors presented the same mutational patterns. Interestingly, gastric cancer only presented KRAS mutations in MSI tumors. Furthermore, in sporadic MSI CRC (which is usually caused by MLH1 hypermethylation) BRAF-V600E was not associated to KRAS, APC or p53 mutations but it was to MLH1 hypermethylation and to genomic hypermethylation after analysing p16, p14, RASSF1A, APC, MGMT and THBS1. In addition, V600E was associated significantly to tumors located in the proximal colon. Moreover, tumors from HNPCC (a hereditary form of MSI cancer caused by germline mutations in mismatch repair genes) never had V600E mutations.
We have also analysed KRAS in CRC showing MSS, sporadic MSI with or without MLH1 hypermethylation and HNPCC. We found that KRAS mutation frequency is higher if MLH1 is not hypermethylated, independently of its sporadic or hereditary origin. And although in sporadic tumors these mutations are located in codon 12, in the hereditary ones they are located in codons 12 or 13 equally. Furthermore, HNPCC tumors carrying germline MLH1 mutations have less KRAS mutations than tumors with germline mutations in MSH2 or MSH6. Finally, we concluded that KRAS and BRAF differences in sporadic and hereditary CRC suggest a different Ras-Raf-MAPK modulation and possible alternative activation pathways depending on the genetic and epigenetic background of the tumor. Moreover, V600E is a reliable, fast and cheap tool for HNPCC diagnosis to exclude a hereditary origin. """,2007,

"Early Cretaceous palynostratigraphy, palynofacies and palaeoenvironments of well sections in northeastern Tierra del Fuego, Argentina","Abstract Palynostratigraphic and palynofacies analyses of the Springhill and Pampa Rincon formations in Argentina and the Estratos con Favrella in Chile, studied in 30 core samples from nine wells in northeast Tierra del Fuego, yielded an Upper Valanginianâ€“Cenomanian(?) palynoflora. The occurrence of 71 terrestrial species (spores and pollen grains) and 39 species of organic-walled phytoplankton are considered in this paper. A correlation was made with the Upper Valanginianâ€“Lower Aptian Cyclusphaera psilata - Classopollis Zone (Neuquen Basin) and the Interulobites-Foraminisporis Assemblage Zone in the Austral Basin (Upper Valanginianâ€“Upper Hauterivian) owing to the presence of bryophytic species such as Interulobites spp. and Polycingulatisporites spp. and the incoming of Cyclusphaera psilata . Celyphus rallus and Balmeiopsis limbatus are also common in this zone. The Barremian tectifera-corrugatus Interval Zone (Austral Basin) was not recognized in the samples studied. The Antulsporites-Clavatipollenites Assemblage Zone of the Austral Basin (Aptian), which is characterized by the occurrence of early angiosperm pollen grains ( Clavatipollenites hughesii , Asteropollis asteroides ) and Cyclusphaera crassa , among others, was recorded. Near the Aptian/Albian boundary, the succession of angiosperms is characterized by the appearance of rare tricolpates. Heterosphaeridium heteracanthun and Isabelidinium sp. were identified in the Heterosphaeridium Superzone (Australia), indicating an age not older than Cenomanian. This corresponds to the nearshoreâ€“shallow marine facies of the Nueva Argentina Formation. Six types of palynofacies (1â€“6) were distinguished and, together with the composition of the palynomorph assemblages, were linked to depositional conditions, deltaic, shallow marine, nearshore and offshore environments being recognised.",2006,Cretaceous Research

Development of a novel score for the prediction of hospital mortality in patients with severe sepsis: the use of electronic healthcare records with LASSO regression,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE
There are several disease severity scores being used for the prediction of mortality in critically ill patients. However, none of them was developed and validated specifically for patients with severe sepsis. The present study aimed to develop a novel prediction score for severe sepsis.


RESULTS
A total of 3206 patients with severe sepsis were enrolled, including 1054 non-survivors and 2152 survivors. The LASSO score showed the best discrimination (area under curve: 0.772; 95% confidence interval: 0.735-0.810) in the validation cohort as compared with other scores such as simplified acute physiology score II, acute physiological score III, Logistic organ dysfunction system, sequential organ failure assessment score, and Oxford Acute Severity of Illness Score. The calibration slope was 0.889 and Brier value was 0.173.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
The study employed a single center database called Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III) MIMIC-III for analysis. Severe sepsis was defined as infection and acute organ dysfunction. Clinical and laboratory variables used in clinical routines were included for screening. Subjects without missing values were included, and the whole dataset was split into training and validation cohorts. The score was coined LASSO score because variable selection was performed using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) technique. Finally, the LASSO score was evaluated for its discrimination and calibration in the validation cohort.


CONCLUSIONS
The study developed the LASSO score for mortality prediction in patients with severe sepsis. Although the score had good discrimination and calibration in a randomly selected subsample, external validations are still required.",2017,Oncotarget
Equilibrium and collapse analysis of masonry bodies,"This paper gives a general formulation of the statics of the masonry continuum within the conceptual framework set up by J. Heyman in his fundamental and pioneering studies of masonry arches and vaults. Here the masonry body will be represented by an assemblage of rigid particles of stones, held together only by compressive forces, and liable to crack as soon as tensile stresses begin to develop. The very small size of the stones, compared to the overall dimensions of the body, permits a treatment in terms of a continuum.The admissible mechanism displacement and stress fields of the masonry body are analysed, and an appropriate formulation of the virtual work equation is given. A variational inequality, involving the sign of the work of external loads along the mechanisms-necessary and sufficient for the existence of the admissible equilibrium states-is then proved. The collapse of the body is then properly formulated and, finally, new versions of the kinematical and statical theorems of failure are proved.SommarioIl presente articolo fornisce una formulazione generale della statica del continuo murario, seguendo l'indirizzo concettuale espresso da Heyman nel suo fondamentale e pionieristico studio su archi e volte in muratura.Nel presente lavoro il solido murario viene schematizzato come un assemblaggio di elementi rigidi di pietra, tenuti insieme da forze di compressione e soggetti a frattura non appena si inneschino trazioni. Le dimensioni ridotte dei conci, in relazione alle dimensioni globali del corpo, consentono di trattare il problema nel continuo.Vengono quindi analizzati i possibili meccanismi, ed i campi di tensione e spostamenti associati, espressi secondo una appropriata formulazione del Principio dei lavori virtuali. Viene poi mostrato come una opportuna diseguaglianza variazionale-che coinvolge il segno del lavoro delle forze esterne lungo i meccanismi-costituisca condizione necessaria e sufficiente per l'esistenza degli stati ammissibili di equilibrio. Utilizzando tale condizione viene quindi fornita una nuova versione dei teoremi statico e cinematico di collasso.",1992,Meccanica
[Palliative operations for correction of claw fingers].,"Palliative treatment of palsy of intrinsic muscles of the four fingers classically aims at suppressing claw. But functional restoration is mainly ensured in setting up again the volar flexion, the stage preparing prehension. Three hundred and thirty seven hands have been operated. Each one of the utilized interventions has advantages and drawbacks that have to be known in order to select the best adapted technics, the more or less important stiffness of fingers being the most important criteria. Finally a simple choice is easy and possible, particularly for inexperienced surgeons in the treatment of those paralysis (that become rarer and rarer in the West on account of the success of nervous sutures facing a large number of leprotic hands to operate in endemic countries); it is the metacarpophalangeal stabilization test: the active interphalangeal extension obtained after passive manual stabilization, of metacarpophalangeal joint indicates the degree of proximal interphalangeal residual stiffness, and the indications come in function of these various types of stiffness. Loose PIP joint: residual flexion from 0 degree to 20 degrees: MP capsular shortening, H shaped, and flexor pulley advancement; ""Lasso"" operation: a single slip of FDS by finger or one FDS for two fingers; Bunnell-Litter's operation: one FDS for 4 fingers; Giraudeau's operation: FCR + fascia lata; Brand's operation: 1st (ECRL) or 2nd (ECRB) + tendon graft; Palande's operation: ECRB + many tailed fascia lata graft fixed at the muscle tendon junction.

Penalized Estimation of Panel Vector Autoregressive Models : A Panel LASSO Approach,"textabstractThis paper proposes LASSO estimation specific for panel vector autoregressive 
(PVAR) models. The penalty term allows for shrinkage for different lags, for shrinkage 
towards homogeneous coeficients across panel units, for penalization of lags of 
variables belonging to another cross-sectional unit, and for varying penalization across 
equations. The penalty parameters therefore build on time series and cross-sectional 
properties that are commonly found in PVAR models. Simulation results point towards 
advantages of using the proposed LASSO for PVAR models over ordinary least 
squares in terms of forecast accuracy. An empirical forecasting application with five 
countries support these findings.",2019,
A transcriptional metabolic gene-set based prognostic signature is associated with clinical and mutational features in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a common cancer with high mortality and poor prognosis partially owing to lack of application of predictive markers. Increasing evidence has suggested that metabolic dysregulation plays an important part in tumorigenesis. We aim to identify a prognostic metabolic pathway (MP) signature in HNSCC. Single sample gene-set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) was used in metabolic gene sets to develop a metabolism-based prognostic risk score (MPRS) for HNSCC using Cox regression analysis (univariate, LASSO, and stepwise multiple cox analysis), which was then validated in different subgroups, and association with clinical and mutational features was analyzed. Seventy-two dysregulated metabolic pathways were identified, and a six-MP signature (6MPS) was constructed which can effectively distinguish between the high- and low-risk patients in both training and testing sets, accompanied with high sensitivity and specificity (AUCâ€‰=â€‰0.7) in prognosis prediction. 6MPS was also applicable to patients of different subgroups. Furthermore, 6MPS is not only an independent prognostic predictor but also associated with clinicopathological and mutational features. Higher tumor stage and tumor mutation burden (TMB) have a higher MPRS. 6MPS functions not only as a promising predictor of prognosis and survival but also as potential marker for therapeutic schedule monitoring.",2020,Journal of Cancer Research and Clinical Oncology
Dynamic Edge Fabric EnvironmenT: Seamless and Automatic Switching among Resources at the Edge of IoT Network and Cloud,"The number of IoT devices at the edge of the network is increasing rapidly. Data from IoT devices can be analysed locally at the edge, or they may be sent to the cloud. Currently, the decision to deploy a task for execution at the edge or in the cloud is not decided as the data are received. Instead the decision is usually based on pre-defined system design and corresponding assumptions about locality and connectivity. However, the mobile environment has rapid, sometimes unpredictable changes and requires a system that can dynamically adapt to these changes. An intelligent platform is required that can discover available resources (both nearby and in the cloud) and autonomously orchestrate a seamless and transparent task allocation at runtime to help the IoT devices achieve their best performance given the available resources. We propose a new platform, DEFT (Dynamic Edge-Fabric environmenT), that can automatically learn where best to execute each task based on real-time system status and task requirements, along with learned behavior from past performance of the available resources. The task allocation decision in this platform is powered by machine learning techniques such as regression models (linear, ridge, Lasso) and ensemble models (random forest, extra trees). We have implemented this platform on heterogeneous devices and run various IoT tasks on the devices. The results reveal that choosing proper machine learning approaches based on the tasks properties and priorities can significantly improve the overall performance of selecting resources (either from the edge or cloud) dynamically at runtime.",2019,2019 IEEE International Conference on Edge Computing (EDGE)
Book Reviews: Introduction to Multivariate Statistical Analysis in Chemometrics,"Introduction to Multivariate Statistical Analysis in Chemometrics. Kurt Varmuza and Peter Filzmoser. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL, 2009. Pp: 321. Price: USD$119.95. ISBN 13 978-14200-5947-2. The new book by Kurt Varmuza, a chemometrician, and Peter Filzmoser, a statistician, takes the reader on a brisk walk though modern data analysis. The collaboration here gives a somewhat unconventional, integrated perspective on the treatment of multivariate data. Like the bookâ€™s coverâ€”a panorama of the Monument Valley area in the American Southwestâ€”the book provides a wide-ranging overview of many â€˜â€˜monumentsâ€™â€™ of chemometrics and modern multivariate statistics, without a tight focus on any one. The tone is introductory throughout. After a first chapter with extensive, up-to-date lists of other texts in chemometrics and multivariate statistics, the authors begin with introductory examples from near-infrared spectroscopy and archaeological glasses, followed by a brief examination of univariate statistical methods. In most cases, only a short discussion is provided, along with a brief mention of the R language object or an R command that performs the test. The use of R, while now common in statistical texts, is less frequent in chemometrics. Moving from this univariate approach to data pretreatment, the authors take on multivariate data pretreatment and outlier detection. Unlike many introductory texts in chemometrics, they cover data transformations and robust methodology here as well as the more conventional centering and scaling. As with univariate methods, the authors provide a brief mention of the R object for performing the task. This chapter shows their focus on graphical depiction of the methods, another attribute of the book that sets it apart from others available. The usual topics that are common to most texts in chemometrics follow: principal components analysis, calibration, classification, and cluster analysis. What is unusual is the inclusion of robust methods throughout, the extensive use of graphical representations of the methods to aid in understanding, and the software examples implementing the methods in R. Readers comfortable with R can follow along by obtaining the libraries and datasets for the examples from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN, at http://cran.r-project.org), as I did. They are all free, as is the R software to run them. While many of the topics covered in calibration and classification are standard, some of the topics considered are unconventional, possibly reflecting field-based differences in the authorsâ€™ perspectives. For example, in calibration, ridge regression gets more than the usual attention, along with the lasso method, as well as ordinary (classical) least squares (OLS) and canonical correlation. Given the recent resurgence of interest in OLS methods by spectroscopists, detailed discussion of OLS is both timely and highly useful. The treatment of the more conventional partial least squares (PLS) and allied methods is both substantial and upto-date: even the recent controversy over orthogonal-scores-based and orthogonal-loadings-based calculation of latent variables in PLS is covered here. When needed, the authors delve into some of the mathematical details, but most of the treatment is not heavily oriented to theory, a feature that those just starting out will surely appreciate. As noted above, classification is considered from a slightly different perspective. The linear discriminant is discussed in detail, but Gaussian mixture models, decision trees, support vector machines, and logistic regression share space with the more commonly presented k-NN and SIMCA classifiers that are routine in commercial chemometric software packages. Similarly, the chapter on clustering covers the usual hierarchical methods present in the commercial packages but also briefly examines fuzzy clustering. A chapter on data preprocessing ends the book. This chapter provides very brief coverage of basic methods such as differentiation, multiplicative scatter correction, and mass spectral normalization methods. It is somewhat less up to date than the other chapters. The authors mention but do not discuss wavelet processing, for example. With all of these methods receiving attention in the span of about 300 pages, readers should not expect comprehensive coverage of all of the popular topics. Some aspects of modern chemometrics donâ€™t make the list: multivariate curve resolution is not covered here, nor are other recent preprocessing methods that are implemented in some software packages, such as orthogonal signal correction. Higher-order methods receive only the briefest of treatment. The Appendices covering matrix algebra and the R language are also quite short; those needing help will likely find these too brief, but there is a good amount of web-based help available on these topics. The spectroscopist will find this a useful reference to modern chemometrics. The integration of chemometric methods with modern multivariate statistical methods should prove particularly useful. The motivated student seeking to gain experience in data analysis will find this a balanced, insightful, and accessible introduction to the field. Given the use of R software to implement the methods discussed in the text, and the high overlap of multivariate statistics and chemometrics in recent literature, this is a text that offers a good deal. It offers even more to the reader who invests a bit of time learning enough R to put the accompanying software library to use. There is a great deal of useful chemometrics available here for the price of a textbook. I highly recommend the book.",2010,Applied Spectroscopy
Convolutional Neural Network with Graphical Lasso to Extract Sparse Topological Features for Brain Disease Classification.,"The functional connectivity provides new insights into the mechanisms of the human brain at network-level, which has been proved to be an effective biomarker for brain disease classification. Recently, machine learning methods have played an important role in functional connectivity classification, among which convolutional neural network (CNN) based methods become a new hot topic since they can extract topological features in the brain network. However, the conventional CNN-based methods haven't taken sparse connectivity patterns (SCPs) of the human brain into consideration, which may lead to redundancy of the topological features, and limit their performance and generalization. To solve it, we propose a novel CNN-based model with graphical Lasso (CNNGLasso) to extract sparse topological features for brain disease classification. Firstly, we develop a novel graphical Lasso model for revealing the SCPs at group-level. Then, the SCPs are used to guide the topological feature extraction. Finally, the obtained sparse topological features are used to classify the patients from normal controls. The experiment results on the ABIDE dataset demonstrate that the CNNGLasso outperforms the others on various performances. Besides, the abnormal brain regions derived from the trained model are consistent with the previous investigations, which further proves the application prospect of the CNNGLasso.",2020,IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics
Oracle model selection for correlated data via residuals,"Abstract This paper concerns model selection for autoregressive time series when the observations are contaminated with trend. We propose an adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) type model selection method, in which the trend is estimated by B-splines, the detrended residuals are calculated, and then the residuals are used as if they were observations to optimize an adaptive LASSO type objective function. The oracle properties of such an adaptive LASSO model selection procedure are established; that is, the proposed method can identify the true model with probability approaching one as the sample size increases, and the asymptotic properties of estimators are not affected by the replacement of observations with detrended residuals. The intensive simulation studies of several constrained and unconstrained autoregressive models also confirm the theoretical results. The method is illustrated by two time series data sets, the annual U.S. tobacco production and annual tree ring width measurements.",2019,Communications in Statistics - Theory and Methods

A lasso based ensemble empirical mode decomposition approach to designing adaptive clutter suppression filters,"Accurate estimation of the blood flow velocity in ultrasound imaging is an important tool for medical diagnostics. In this paper, we adopt an improved empirical mode decomposition (EMD) framework called ensemble EMD (EEMD). To reduce the errors caused by the outliers in data when using a uniform weight in conventional EEMD, a regularized LASSO EEMD algorithm is proposed to solve for the multiple regression weights. An adaptive clutter rejection filter can then be designed to remove the clutter components. According to our simulation study, the proposed LASSO EEMD approach performs better than the state-of-the-art eigen-based and EMD method in estimating the blood flow velocity. Although the LASSO EEMD derived filter only achieves slightly better results than the cubic regression derived filters at most part of the simulated blood flow center frequencies, the proposed LASSO EEMD algorithm achieves much improved performance over cubic regression at extreme cases when the blood flow center frequency is close to or much higher than that of the clutter.",2012,"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)"
Identifying incident dementia by applying machine learning to a very large administrative claims dataset,"INTRODUCTION Alzheimerâ€™s disease and related dementias (ADRD) are highly prevalent conditions, and prior efforts to develop predictive models have relied on demographic and clinical risk factors using traditional logistical regression methods. We hypothesized that machine-learning algorithms using administrative claims data may represent a novel approach to predicting ADRD. METHODS Using a national de-identified dataset of more than 125 million patients including over 10,000 clinical, pharmaceutical, and demographic variables, we developed a cohort to train a machine learning model to predict ADRD 4-5 years in advance. RESULTS The Lasso algorithm selected a 50-variable model with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.693. Top diagnosis codes in the model were memory loss (780.93), Parkinsonâ€™s disease (332.0), mild cognitive impairment (331.83) and bipolar disorder (296.80), and top pharmacy codes were psychoactive drugs. DISCUSSION Machine learning algorithms can rapidly develop predictive models for ADRD with massive datasets, without requiring hypothesis-driven feature engineering. RESEARCH IN CONTEXT Systematic review: Previous attempts to predict incident dementia have relied on extensive clinical evaluations, cognitive testing, laboratory testing, neuro-imaging, genetic factors, demographics, and lifestyle variables. Applying machine learning to a large administrative claims dataset to identify individuals at increased likelihood for near-term diagnosis of dementia had not been tested. Interpretation: A 50-variable model to identify those at risk for near-term diagnosis of dementia was created and validated. Based on AUC analysis, the model compared favorably with other historical attempts at modeling more traditional forms of data. Future direction: Models, such as the one developed here, could be used to identify populations of higher prior probability for near-term diagnosis of dementia. These could then be subjected to more in-depth scrutiny for intervention or dementia-related research eligibility.",2018,bioRxiv
Penalized regression for interval-censored times of disease progression: Selection of HLA markers in psoriatic arthritis.,"Times of disease progression are interval-censored when progression status is only known at a series of assessment times. This situation arises routinely in clinical trials and cohort studies when events of interest are only detectable upon imaging, based on blood tests, or upon careful clinical examination. We consider the problem of selecting important prognostic biomarkers from a large set of candidates when disease progression status is only known at irregularly spaced and individual-specific assessment times. Penalized regression techniques (e.g., LASSO, adaptive LASSO, and SCAD) are adapted to handle interval-censored time of disease progression. An expectation-maximization algorithm is described which is empirically shown to perform well. Application to the motivating study of the development of arthritis mutilans in patients with psoriatic arthritis is given and several important human leukocyte antigen (HLA) variables are identified for further investigation.",2015,Biometrics

And as applications, we shall prove new existence theorems of equilibrium pairs for free n-person games. For these purposes, we have introduced the following proximity notations:",2007,Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications
In situ observations of Stygiomedusa gigantea in the Gulf of Mexico with a review of its global distribution and habitat,"Four individuals of the large scyphozoan jellyfish Stygiomedusa gigantea were observed in the northern Gulf of Mexico over 2005â€“2009 by industrial remotely operated vehicles as part of the SERPENT Project. One of these observations included the symbiotic bythitid fish Thalassobathia pelagica . Prior to these observations, neither S. gigantea nor T. pelagica had been observed in, or collected from the Gulf of Mexico. In order to summarize the available information on S. gigantea , we located 110 observations obtained over 110 years (1899â€“2009) representing 118 individual specimens of this species from around the world. The resulting dataset confirms that this species is cosmopolitan occurring with records from all oceans except the Arctic. While the depth-range of the four Gulf of Mexico specimens was bathypelagic, there appears to be a pattern of S. gigantea occurring in mesopelagic and epipelagic depth-zones at high latitudes, particularly in the Southern Ocean and mesopelagic and bathypelagic depths at mid- and low-latitudes. This pattern may be related to the meridional vertical distribution of temperature or perhaps avoidance of light levels that could degrade porphyrin pigments. There was no evidence that this species migrates vertically. Two of the individuals in the Gulf of Mexico appeared to be actively clinging to subsea structures and we speculate that this is a consequence of its normal mode of feeding, which may entail using its large oral lobes to hold on to, and trap prey.",2010,Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom
An e-mail environment with handwriting using the HandsDraw digital ink format,"This paper proposes a handwriting-based e-mail environment system, including the HandsDraw format, whose facilities include the reading and writing of handwritten massages, their transmission and reception, annotations or comments by recipients, confirmation of the author and time of writing, and reproduction of handwriting. The system has a user interface which is friendly even to a beginner, and can handle more expressive massages on the Internet. The system is regarded as an advanced mobile communication terminal of the kind which has been fashionable recently. Considering the advantages and disadvantages of pen input, encircling (lasso) selection and a button interface are used for dialogue. Users' opinions (collected by questionnaires, on the Internet, and from laboratory use of the system for 2 1/2 years) confirm all of the functions of the system. Some respondents have suggested the conversion of handwritten characters to a type font (rather than sending them directly) by using the character-recognition facility in this system.

A novel realâ€time computational framework for detecting catheters and rigid guidewires in cardiac catheterization procedures,"PURPOSE
Catheters and guidewires are used extensively in cardiac catheterization procedures such as heart arrhythmia treatment (ablation), angioplasty, and congenital heart disease treatment. Detecting their positions in fluoroscopic X-ray images is important for several clinical applications, for example, motion compensation, coregistration between 2D and 3D imaging modalities, and 3D object reconstruction.


METHODS
For the generalized framework, a multiscale vessel enhancement filter is first used to enhance the visibility of wire-like structures in the X-ray images. After applying adaptive binarization method, the centerlines of wire-like objects were extracted. Finally, the catheters and guidewires were detected as a smooth path which is reconstructed from centerlines of target wire-like objects. In order to classify electrode catheters which are mainly used in electrophysiology procedures, additional steps were proposed. First, a blob detection method, which is embedded in vessel enhancement filter with no additional computational cost, localizes electrode positions on catheters. Then the type of electrode catheters can be recognized by detecting the number of electrodes and also the shape created by a series of electrodes. Furthermore, for detecting guiding catheters or guidewires, a localized machine learning algorithm is added into the framework to distinguish between target wire objects and other wire-like artifacts. The proposed framework were tested on total 10,624 images which are from 102 image sequences acquired from 63 clinical cases.


RESULTS
Detection errors for the coronary sinus (CS) catheter, lasso catheter ring and lasso catheter body are 0.56Â Â±Â 0.28Â mm, 0.64Â Â±Â 0.36Â mm, and 0.66Â Â±Â 0.32Â mm, respectively, as well as success rates of 91.4%, 86.3%, and 84.8% were achieved. Detection errors for guidewires and guiding catheters are 0.62Â Â±Â 0.48Â mm and success rates are 83.5%.


CONCLUSION
The proposed computational framework do not require any user interaction or prior models and it can detect multiple catheters or guidewires simultaneously and in real-time. The accuracy of the proposed framework is sub-mm and the methods are robust toward low-dose X-ray fluoroscopic images, which are mainly used during procedures to maintain low radiation dose.",2018,Medical Physics
Measuring the Environmental Benefits from Transportation Electrification: Urban Electric Busesâˆ—,"We determine the environmental benefit of using electric buses rather than diesel for urban transit. For diesel we calculate air pollution damages using an integrated assessment model (AP3). For electric buses we initially use marginal damage estimates from the literature. The environmental benefit of operating an electric bus fleet (rather than diesel) is about $70 million per year in Los Angeles and above $9 million per year in five other MSAâ€™s. Thirteen MSAâ€™s have benefits which exceed 10/c per mile, and the benefit in Los Angeles exceeds 60/c per mile. We also explore three methods for determining more spatially disaggregated estimates of marginal damages from electricity consumption. Two of the methods use OLS, and one uses a machine learning technique (Lasso). Using data from Texas, which allows for a rich set of controls, we show these methods provide similar estimates for the three largest regions. Moreover, two of the methods may work reasonably well in other parts of the country for which detailed controls have not been available. Preliminary. Please do not cite or quote.

Quadro generale degli sviluppi: interventi senza precedenti per contrastare la crisi finanziaria mondiale,"Le preoccupazioni per la stabilita finanziaria sono ancora una volta tornate alla ribalta nel periodo tra fine agosto e fine novembre quando, allâ€™indomani del fallimento di Lehman Brothers a meta settembre, i mercati finanziari mondiali si sono praticamente bloccati, inaugurando una nuova e piu acuta fase della crisi. Allorche i fondi del mercato monetario e altri investitori si sono trovati costretti a stralciare dai propri portafogli gli investimenti collegati alla banca dâ€™affari statunitense, i timori per il rischio di controparte si sono intensificati e le richieste di riscatto dai fondi di investimento hanno raggiunto proporzioni ingenti. Lâ€™ondata di vendite che ne e risultata ha risparmiato soltanto le attivita piu sicure, pregiudicando il funzionamento di parti essenziali del sistema finanziario internazionale. Di fronte al congelamento di fatto dei mercati creditizi e monetari e al crollo dei corsi azionari, le banche e le altre societa finanziarie hanno visto deteriorarsi il loro accesso alle fonti di finanziamento e restringersi la loro base patrimoniale per lâ€™accumulo di perdite da svalutazione. Gli spread creditizi sono saliti a livelli record, le quotazioni azionarie sono precipitate e la volatilita ha subito unâ€™impennata in tutti i mercati, segnalando una situazione di estrema tensione finanziaria. I timori di recessione e gli investimenti rifugio hanno prevalso in misura crescente sullâ€™impatto del previsto aumento dei disavanzi pubblici, facendo diminuire i rendimenti dei titoli di Stato. Al tempo stesso si e accentuata lâ€™inclinazione positiva delle curve dei rendimenti, di riflesso ai ripetuti aggiustamenti al ribasso dei tassi ufficiali. La forte avversione al rischio e le pressioni che ne sono scaturite nei paesi industrializzati si sono propagate anche ai mercati finanziari delle economie emergenti, dove le attivita hanno subito perdite di valore generalizzate. Di fronte al crollo di fiducia nella capacita di sopravvivenza di parti importanti del sistema bancario internazionale, le autorita di vari paesi hanno intrapreso una serie senza precedenti di iniziative volte ad arrestare il collasso dei prezzi delle attivita e a contenere i rischi sistemici. Lâ€™evoluzione dei mercati nel periodo in rassegna ha attraversato quattro fasi abbastanza distinte. La prima, culminata con il fallimento di Lehman Brothers a meta settembre, e stata marcata dallâ€™acquisizione da parte delle autorita statunitensi delle due principali agenzie federali di credito immobiliare. Le implicazioni immediate del dissesto della banca dâ€™affari, e la crisi generalizzata di fiducia che ne e conseguita, si sono avvertite nella seconda",2008,
An Efficient Augmented Lagrangian Based Method for Constrained Lasso,"Variable selection is one of the most important tasks in statistics and machine learning. To incorporate more prior information about the regression coefficients, the constrained Lasso model has been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we present an inexact augmented Lagrangian method to solve the Lasso problem with linear equality constraints. By fully exploiting second-order sparsity of the problem, we are able to greatly reduce the computational cost and obtain highly efficient implementations. Furthermore, numerical results on both synthetic data and real data show that our algorithm is superior to existing first-order methods in terms of both running time and solution accuracy.",2019,ArXiv
