Improved channel estimation with partial sparse constraint for AF cooperative communication systems,"Accurate channel state information (CSI) is necessary for coherent detection in amplify and forward (AF) broadband cooperative communication systems. Based on the assumption of ordinary sparse channel, efficient sparse channel estimation methods have been investigated in our previous works. However, when the cooperative channel exhibits partial sparse structure rather than ordinary sparsity, our previous method cannot take advantage of the prior information. In this paper, we propose an improved channel estimation method with partial sparse constraint on cooperative channel. At first, we formulate channel estimation as a compressive sensing problem and utilize sparse decomposition theory. Secondly, the cooperative channel is reconstructed by LASSO with partial sparse constraint. Finally, numerical simulations are carried out to confirm the superiority of proposed methods over ordinary sparse channel estimation methods.",2012,2012 18th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications (APCC)
Commenti su Cole et al. (1992). IV. Le caldere del vulcano di Roccamorfina,"Lo stratocono del valicano di Roccamonfina presenta almeno quattro caldere: caldera principale (centrale sommita1e), caldera di Gli Stagli, caldera settentrionale e caldera di Valle. Lâ€™origine di queste caldere e indipendente dalle eruzioni delle ignimbriti (Tufo Leucitico Marrone, BLT, e Tufo Trachitico Bianco, WIT), ad eccezione forse della caldera settentrionale. Inedite datazioni attribuiscono alla caldera principale unâ€™eta fra 446.000 e 390.000 anni. La caldera di Gli Stagli interseca quella principale ed e quindi piu recente. Lungo il settore settentrionale della cinta della caldera di Gli Stagli le colate laviche di leucite-tefriti macrofiriche si alternano con sedimenti lacustri, suggerendo che eruzioni laviche e sedimentazione lacustre si alternarono nel tempo. Le leucite-tefriti macrofiriche datate costituenti la cinta della caldera settentrionale sono piu recenti di quelle delle altre cinte calderiche, suggerendo che la caldera settentrionale si formo successivamente alle altre due caldere. La vicinanza tra le eta della caldera settentrionale e quelle del BLT suggerisce la possibilita di uno stretto legame genetico tra la formazione della caldera e lâ€™eruzione del tufo. La caldera di Gli Stagli fu successivamente riempita da una potente sequenza di piroclastiti. Il successivo collasso determino il ringiovanimento della caldera stessa e la formazione della caldera di Valle.",1995,
Factorial Network Models To Improve P2P Credit Risk Management,"This paper investigates how to improve statistical-based credit scoring of SMEs involved in P2P lending. The methodology discussed in the paper is a factor network-based segmentation for credit score modeling. The approach first constructs a network of SMEs where links emerge from comovement of latent factors, which allows us to segment the heterogeneous population into clusters. We then build a credit score model for each cluster via lasso-type regularization logistic regression. We compare our approach with the conventional logistic model by analyzing the credit score of over 15000 SMEs engaged in P2P lending services across Europe. The result reveals that credit risk modeling using our network-based segmentation achieves higher predictive performance than the conventional model.",2019,

A preliminary study in aspects of structural continuity in Lasso's Penitential Psalms,"The Penitential Psalms is often referenced as Orlando di Lassoâ€™s most famous 
piece; however, it remains largely untouched by scholars, plagued by some of the 
same problems that typically impede research on Lassoâ€™s works: that is, bulk and 
musical variation. Although there have been a few comparative studies of the cycle 
with the most recent being Stefan Schulzeâ€™s study on modality in settings by 
Orlando di Lasso, Alexander Utendal and Jacob Reiner: Die Tonarten in Lassos 
â€œBusspsalmenâ€ (1984), this is the first study since Herrmann Bauerleâ€™s dissertation 
Musikphilologische Studie uber die Sieben Busspsalmen (1906), that deals 
exclusively with Lassoâ€™s Penitential Psalms from an analytical perspective. 
Because of the problems mentioned, analysis of the Penitential Psalms is very 
much a methodological challenge, due to its scope and use of varied musical style 
throughout the cycle. Structure was indubitably a primary concern in the 
composition of the Penitential Psalms, as shown in the title of the work published 
first in 1584 â€“ â€˜modis musicis redditiâ€™. In proving the hypothesis that Lasso, indeed, 
employs other musical elements, as well as mode, in such a capacity as to reinforce 
the structure of the cycle, there are two main lines of inquiry in the musical aspects 
that were analyzed in this study (motivicity and harmony): (1) To what extent do 
certain observed phenomena occur and what function does this serve? (2) To what 
degree are these phenomena used in the composition? The minor doxology was 
used as the underlying focus of this study to function as a type of control group. 
This was ideal since the text remains a constant throughout all seven settings, 
corresponding to each of the seven penitential psalms across the cycle. In 
demonstrated compositional patterns, both of the above lines of inquiry together 
form the basis for a more complete understanding of the psalms as well as the 
musical logic which gives the cycle a remarkable degree of coherence based on the 
interrelatedness of the phenomena observed.",2011,
"The palynological assemblages from the Jâ€“K boundary beds of the Bureya Basin, Russian Far East","Abstract Palynological assemblages were studied from the coal-bearing Upper Jurassic (Talanja Formation) to the Lower Cretaceous (Dublikan Formation) deposits of the Bureya Basin, Russia. The palynological assemblages from the upper part of the Talanja Formation are dominated by gymnosperms, mainly Ginkgocycadophytus (up to 40%) and conifers related to Pinaceae (up to 70%). The contribution of non-seed plants is not great, but their diversity is considerable. The miospore assemblages of the Talanja sequence are characterized by the last appearance of the spore taxa Staplinisporites pocockii , Camptotriletes cerebriformis , Camptotriletes nitida , and Cingulatisporites sanguinolentus . The palynological assemblage from the Dublikan Formation is dominated by ferns (up to 84%), represented mainly by Cyathidites and Duplexisporites . Among gymnosperms the role of Classopollis increases (making up about 20%). Another feature is the first appearance of the spore taxa Stereisporites bujargiensis , Neoraistrickia rotundiformis , Contignisporites dorsostriatus , Appendicisporites tricostatus , and Concavissimisporites asper .",2008,Palaeoworld
"Discovery of the Middle Jurassic Sporopollen Assemblage in the Chenjiawan Formation of Zigui Basin, Hubei and Its Significance","A spore and pollen assemblage was discovered from the Chenjiawan Formation in the Zigui Basin, Hubei, which can be referred to the Cyathidites minor-Classopollis-Callialasporites assemblage of Middle Jurassic. In general, the character of the Chenjiawan assemblage is consistent with the assemblages in the Xietan Formation and the Shaximiao Formation of Middle Jurassic in the Zigui Basin. But there is a little difference between the early and the middle-later assemblages. The vertical distribution of spore and pollen flora in the Jurassic indicates that the weather has transformed from high to low humidity. The Early Jurassic features sub-tropic and tropic, hot and humid, with flourishing plants. Later, drought appears but the wet climate is still dominant. The early time of Middle Jurassic enters half dry weather becoming progressively drier. The Late Jurassic is an extremely drought world with few species of plants where Cheirolepidiaceae are predominent.",2004,
Orthogonalizing Penalized Regression,"Since the penalized likelihood function of the smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) penalty is highly non-linear and has many local optima, finding a local solution to achieve the so-called oracle property is an open problem. We propose an iterative algorithm, called the OEM algorithm, to fill this gap. The development of the algorithm draws direct impetus from a missing-data problem arising in design of experiments with an orthogonal complete matrix. In each iteration, the algorithm imputes the missing data based on the current estimates of the parameters and updates a closed-form solution associated with the complete data. By introducing a procedure called active orthogonization, we make the algorithm broadly applicable to problems with arbitrary regression matrices. In addition to the SCAD penalty, the proposed algorithm works for other penalties like the MCP, lasso and nonnegative garrote. Convergence and convergence rate of the algorithm are examined. The algorithm has several unique theoretical properties. For the SCAD and MCP penalties, an OEM sequence can achieve the oracle property after sufficient iterations. For various penalties, an OEM sequence converges to a point having grouping coherence for fully aliased regression matrices. For computing the ordinary least squares estimator with a singular regression matrix, an OEM sequence converges to the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse-based least squares estimator.",2011,
"Multivalvulid Myxozoans from Eastern Australia: Three New Species of Kudoa from Scombrid and Labrid Fishes of the Great Barrier Reef, Queensland, Australia","Three new species of Kudoa, each having 6 polar capsules, are described from the somatic muscle of fishes collected on the Great Barrier Reef, Queensland, Australia. Kudoa grammatorcyni n. sp. was observed in the shark mackerel Grammatorcynus bicarinatus. Spores are stellate in apical view, width (all measurements in Î¼m) 8.62 (8.03â€“8.95); thickness 8.14 (7.63â€“ 8.68); suture width 7.7 (7.24â€“8.16); length 6.54 (6.32â€“6.71); polar capsule length 3.68 (3.55â€“3.82); polar capsule width 1.72 (1.65â€“1.84). Kudoa scomberomori n. sp. is described from the Spanish mackerel Scomberomorus commerson. Spores are stellate in apical view, width 7.56 (6.84â€“8.16); thickness 6.79 (6.18â€“7.63); suture width 5.92 (5.26â€“6.32); length 5.43 (5.00â€“6.18); polar capsule length 3.24 (3.03â€“3.55); polar capsule width 1.37 (1.25â€“1.51).

"Integrated, Co-located, Telemedicine-based Treatment Approaches for Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Management in Opioid Use Disorder Patients on Methadone.","Background and aims
Despite high hepatitis C virus (HCV) prevalence, opioid use disorder (OUD) patients on methadone rarely engage in HCV treatment. We investigated the effectiveness of HCV management via telemedicine in an opioid substitution therapy (OST) program.


Methods
OUD patients on methadone underwent biweekly telemedicine sessions between a hepatologist and physician assistant during the entire HCV treatment course. All pretreatment labs (HCV RNA, genotype and noninvasive fibrosis assessments) were obtained onsite and direct acting antivirals were co-administered with methadone using modified directly observed therapy. We used multiple correspondence analysis, LASSO, and logistic regression to identify variables associated with pursuit of HCV care.


Results
Sixty-two HCV RNA-positive patients (24% HIV-infected, 61% male, 61% black/African-American, 25.8% Hispanic) were evaluated. All patients were stabilized on methadone and all except 4 were HCV genotype 1-infected. Advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis was present in 34.5% of patients. Of the 45 treated patients, 42 (93.3%) achieved viral eradication. Of 17 evaluated patients who were not treated, 5 were discontinued from the drug treatment program or did not follow-up after the evaluation, 2 had HIV adherence issues, and 10 had insurance authorization issues. Marriage and a mental health diagnosis other than depression were the strongest positive predictors of treatment pursuit while being divorced, separated, or widowed was the strongest negative predictor.


Conclusion
HCV management via telemedicine integrated into an OST program is a feasible model with excellent virologic effectiveness. Psychosocial and demographic variables can assist in identification of subgroups with a propensity or aversion to pursue HCV treatment.",2018,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America
Inferring Microbial Interactions from Metagenomic Time-series Using Prior Biological Knowledge,"Due to the recent advances in modern metagenomics sequencing methods, it becomes possible to directly analyze the microbial communities within human body. To understand how microbial communities adapt, develop, and interact over time with the human body and the surrounding environment, a critical step is the inference of interactions among different microbes directly from sequencing data. However, metagenomics data is both compositional and highly dimensional in nature. Consequently, new approaches that can accurately and robustly estimate the interactions among various microbe species are needed to analyze such data. To this end, we propose a novel framework called Microbial Time-series Prior Lasso (MTPLasso) which integrates sparse linear regression with microbial co-occurrences and associations obtained from scientific literature and cross-sectional metagenomics data. We show that MTPLasso outperforms existing models in terms of precision and recall rates, as well as the accuracy in inferring the interaction types. Finally, the interaction networks we infer from human gut data demonstrate credible results when compared against real data.",2017,"Proceedings of the 8th ACM International Conference on Bioinformatics, Computational Biology,and Health Informatics"

Il monumento architettonico. Questioni di composizione architettonica e urbana nei progetti di Friedrich Gilly e Karl Friedrich Schinkel.,"Rivoluzioni a tutti i livelli della societa, nell'arte e nella cultura, nell'economia e nella politica, nelle scienze umane e nella tecnica, caratterizzano il periodo tra la fine del XVIII e la meta del XIX secolo. Illuminismo e rivoluzione industriale sono i due momenti chiave, la loro unione il motore, da cui scaturiscono quelle forze di rottura che in pochi decenni, tra il 1789 e il 1848, conducono l'Europa alle soglie del mondo moderno. Due rivoluzioni, come pietre migliari, marcano l'esistenza di questo periodo, dalla rivoluzione francese al 1848, separandola, come cesure, dal resto della storia e definendola, quasi, come un'epoca autonoma. Piu che un'epoca in senso stretto si potrebbe, dunque, definire una ""Zwischen Zeit"", un lasso di tempo, un periodo di transizione, che abbraccia poco piu di una generazione, e nella sua ambivalenza puo essere letta come una soglia, appunto, tra un prima e un dopo. Proprio questa sua autonomia, questo suo essere una sorta di parentesi, fluttuante tra due epoche definite, e uno dei caratteri particolari di questo momento: sfugge allo sviluppo storico e sembra esitere nel tempo, come una entita indipendente, con un principio, uno sviluppo e una fine. Di questa condizione e forse uno specchio la predilezione per le categorie assolute, l'amore per il grande e per l'eterno, che e uno dei tratti piu caratteristici dell'estetica dell'idealismo e del romanticismo, e che in architettura si esprime nell'idea del monumento, o meglio di una monumentalita primaria, come condizione elettiva, antecedente alle determinazioni stilistiche, necessaria per ritrovare il legame perduto tra funzione e significato dell'architettura. L'avanguardia della generazione nata intorno al 1770, alla quale apartengono Beethoven (1770- 1827), Holderlin (1770-1843) o Gilly (1772-1800), Hegel (1770-1831) o Schelling (1775-1854), e alla quale si possono ascrivere ancora Fichte (1762-1814) o Schiller (1759-1805), mobilita le proprie forze contro un progetto del moderno, nel quale l'illuminismo minacciava di trasformarsi in un processo unidimensionale di razionalizzazione. La protesta della giovane generazione, passionale e dalle tinte romantiche, e fondamentale per istaurare una sorta di inversione di tendenza, che riporta drammaticamente in primo piano l'unita di conoscenza e sensibilita, avviando un processo di ri-sensibilizzazione necessaria per lo sviluppo successivo. Anche in architettura. La generazione di Schinkel (1781-1841), quella di Brentano (1778-1842), Arnim (1781-1831), Schopenhauer (1778-1860), Carl Maria von Weber (1786-1826), di solo dieci anni piu vecchia, ha gia raggiunto una maturita artistica equilibrata e cosciente, che ha molto poco dell'avanguardia. Se i primi sono appassionati propugnatori di nuove idee, esaltati e militanti, i secondi sono lucidi realisti, promotori della trasformazione, si, ma dall'interno della struttura statale. Se la lezione dei primi non e metodica ne didascalica, ma piuttosto una esplosione poetica, quella degli altri cerca di ripristinare i canali istituzionali, primo tra tutti quello della scuola. Sono due momenti strettamente legati, conseguenti e necessari, entrambi, per comprendere e descrivere interamente l'evoluzione culturale di questo momento e il suo senso rispetto alla formazione del pensiero moderno. Cosi si spiega anche â€”al dila della dichiarazione di Schinkel di essere in tutto e per tutto debitore all'opera del suo maestro prematuramente scomparsoâ€” l'importanza di studiare Gilly e di Schinkel insieme: perche solo nella loro unita di intenti e di obiettvi e nella continuita del loro lavoro si riconosce per intero quel processo di rottura e di ricomposizione che investe e trasforma radicalmente anche il mondo dell'architettura. All'interno di questo processo di trasfromazione e rinnovamento sociale e artistico, che investe tutti i livelli del pensiero, la discussione sul monumento rappresenta, in architettura, e in particolare a Berlino, il tema piu significativo e originale, quello che incarna piu profondamente le tensioni di questo momento e ne disegna, rispetto alla tradizione, le linee di confine. Il lavoro si concentra dunque sullo studio delle architetture commemorative, e in particolare sulla vicenda del monumento a Fedrico il Grande, come strumento per affrontare in modo diretto e concreto il problema piu generale del significato dell'architettura e del suo valore evocativo, e definire, attraverso lo studio degli esempi e delle riflessioni teoriche che li accompagnano, la ""monumentalita"" come una condizione caratteristica, necessaria e intrinseca all'architettura, indipendentemente dalla sua destinazione. Data la complessita del tema e la difficolta a definirne i limiti, in senso terminologico, ma anche concettuale, si e scelto di affrontare la questione limitandola cronologicamente a un periodo determinato e di analizzarla esclusivamente attraverso l'esperienza considerata ""esemplare"" degli architetti berlinesi. La volonta e, dunque, quella di dare alla riflessione un carattere storico â€”di cui e specchio la raccolta documentaria che accompagna, in forma antologica, ogni capitoloâ€”, senza tuttavia perdere di vista l'obiettivo piu generale, cioe quello di formulare comunque un giudizio, che sia espressione di una operativita implicita nello studio e nella ricerca",1999,
Asymptotic properties of the residual bootstrap for Lasso estimators,"In this article, we derive the asymptotic distribution of the bootstrapped Lasso estimator of the regression parameter in a multiple linear regression model. It is shown that under some mild regularity conditions on the design vectors and the regularization parameter, the bootstrap approximation converges weakly to a random measure. The convergence result rigorously establishes a previously known heuristic formula for the limit distribution of the bootstrapped Lasso estimator. It is also shown that when one or more components of the regression parameter vector are zero, the bootstrap may fail to be consistent.",2010,

Acute Kidney Injury Risk Prediction in Patients Undergoing Coronary Angiography in a National Veterans Health Administration Cohort With External Validation,"BACKGROUND
Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs frequently after cardiac catheterization and percutaneous coronary intervention. Although a clinical risk model exists for percutaneous coronary intervention, no models exist for both procedures, nor do existing models account for risk factors prior to the index admission. We aimed to develop such a model for use in prospective automated surveillance programs in the Veterans Health Administration.


METHODS AND RESULTS
We collected data on all patients undergoing cardiac catheterization or percutaneous coronary intervention in the Veterans Health Administration from January 01, 2009 to September 30, 2013, excluding patients with chronic dialysis, end-stage renal disease, renal transplant, and missing pre- and postprocedural creatinine measurement. We used 4 AKI definitions in model development and included risk factors from up to 1 year prior to the procedure and at presentation. We developed our prediction models for postprocedural AKI using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and internally validated using bootstrapping. We developed models using 115 633 angiogram procedures and externally validated using 27 905 procedures from a New England cohort. Models had cross-validated C-statistics of 0.74 (95% CI: 0.74-0.75) for AKI, 0.83 (95% CI: 0.82-0.84) for AKIN2, 0.74 (95% CI: 0.74-0.75) for contrast-induced nephropathy, and 0.89 (95% CI: 0.87-0.90) for dialysis.


CONCLUSIONS
We developed a robust, externally validated clinical prediction model for AKI following cardiac catheterization or percutaneous coronary intervention to automatically identify high-risk patients before and immediately after a procedure in the Veterans Health Administration. Work is ongoing to incorporate these models into routine clinical practice.",2015,Journal of the American Heart Association: Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Disease

Role of m5C-related regulatory genes in the diagnosis and prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignancies globally, and is frequently associated with a poor prognosis. 5-methylcytosine (m5C) is a common epigenetic modification with many critical roles in eukaryotes. However, the expression and functional roles of m5C regulators are largely unknown. In this study, we utilized The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to determine the expression, gene signatures, and prognostic values of m5C-related genes. We confirmed that the frequency of mutation events of m5C regulatory genes was high in HCC (35/363). Dysregulation of m5C-related genes was also associated with a higher HCC stage. Moreover, a strong relationship was found between the expression of m5C regulatory genes and HCC patient survival. High expression of NSUN4 and ALYREF correlated significantly with survival outcome. We developed a two-gene signature of m5C regulators with HCC prognostic value based on the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and multivariate Cox regression models. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) results indicated that high expression of NSUN4 was associated with methylation and demethylation processes. Meanwhile, high expression of ALYREF was clearly related to cell cycle regulation and mitosis. In conclusion, our results revealed that m5C-related genes play an essential role in tumor progression in HCC. Further detection of m5C methylation could provide a novel method for HCC targeted therapy.",2020,American journal of translational research

Themechanism bywhichthepersistent infection isestablished ispoorly understood, inspite of almost twodecades ofintensive investigation. However, itis believed thatinitial infection bythevirusofindividuals destined todevelop SSPEoccurswhentheysuffer uncomplicated rubeola (3). Duringthis acuteinfection thevirus invades theCNS (18)and,by analogy toexperimental modelsofSSPE (12,25),undergoes a brief periodof complete replication. Then,thevirus assumes a persistent statethatischaracterized bya lackofvirion assembly (23) andan overall lowlevel ofviral gene product expression (16). The causes forthischangeininfection stateare unclear, butthetemporal correlation that hasbeenobserved between itandtheappearanceofviral-specific antibodies in serum suggests thatimmunemechanisms may beinvolved (12, 25). We havepreviously described an experimental system usingnewbornhamsters andtheLEC strain (5)ofSSPE virusthatmodelstheinduction ofnonproductive CNS infections bymeasles virus (11, 12,13a,13b). Findings with thissystemhavesuggested thattheestablishment ofthe cell-associated infection statearises fromtheselective elimination ofproductively infected CNS cells, whichleaves behindcells carrying nonproductive, cell-associated virus. Evidence forthisconclusion includes theobservation that LEC virusspontaneously interconverts betweencellassociated andproductive forms(11)andtheisolation of nonproductive, cell-associated viral variants frominfected CNS tissues throughout thecourseoftheinfection, includingtimesbefore theappearanceofantiviral antibodies (13a) even inanimals subjected inimmunosuppression bypassive",1987,
Old Age Support: Expectations and Experiences in a South Indian Village,"Future expectations of support in old age and current conditions of living among the elderly are analysed in the context of changing socio-economic structures in a South Indian village. Evidence shows that the traditional means of support â€“ sons â€“ are becoming less reliable. The experience of the elderly, on the other hand, shows that the elderly are in a worse economic situation than would be expected from the Indian cultural ideal. In particular, the poor and women are most affected in terms of old-age support. The evidence about the link between fertility and old-age support suggests a middle position in the Cain-Vlassoff debate. While existing living conditions make children the main source of support in old age, they are becoming less reliable as a result of recent economic and social changes.",1994,Population Studies-a Journal of Demography
Analyse PCR et rÃ©partition spatiale des trypanosomes infectÃ©s par des mouches tsÃ©-tsÃ© dans l'aire de Sideradougou (Burkina Faso),"A parasitological and entomological survey was conducted in the Sideradougou area (South of Bobo Dioulasso, Burkina Faso) in order to identify transmission factors of Africa animal trypanosomis. A total of 3600 tsetse flies (#Glossina tachinoides#, #Glossina palpalis gambiensis#) werere captured along 120 km of linear gallery forest and half were dissected, PCR analysis was undertaken on parasitologically positive flies (161 #G. tachinoides#, 92 #G. palpalis gambiensis) to characteize the different trypanosomes. All the results were integrated in a GIS (Geographical Information System). Spatial repartition of the characterized trypanosomes enabled to recognize different areas with specific patterns of infection. Relations with environmental factors are discussed.

"Regularization: sparsity, structure and computation","Regularization is a powerful yet versatile technique utilized by many successful modern methods in both machine learning and statistics community. This thesis makes contribution to the study of regularization in three major aspects. First, we introduce a family of penalty functions named Composite Absolute Penalties (CAP) that are highly customizable and through which one can incorporate structural information within the data into regularization in order to improve prediction and interpretation. Efficient computation algorithms are also provided for both computing the regularization path and selecting the amount of regularization. Secondly, we introduce a Booted Lasso (BLasso) algorithm that provides a conceptual link between the popular statistical method Lasso (Tibshirani, 1996) and the machine learning method Boosting (Freund, 1995). It also serves as a simple plug-in algorithm for tracing the regularization path of general convex loss functions with general convex penalties. Finally, we study the model selection consistency of the Lasso and gives an Irrepresentible Condition which is almost necessary and sufficient for Lasso to consistently select the correct model for both small p case and large p case. The proposed methods and works are supported with theories, simulations and experiments on real datasets.",2006,
Prediction Based on Mean Subset,"Shrinkage methods have traditionally been applied in prediction problems. In this article we develop a shrinkage method (mean subset) that forms an average of regression coefficients from individual subsets of the explanatory variables. A Bayesian approach is taken to derive an expression of how the coefficient vectors from each subset should be weighted. It is not computationally feasible to calculate the mean subset coefficient vector for larger problems, and thus we suggest an algorithm to find an approximation to the mean subset coefficient vector. In a comprehensive Monte Carlo simulation study, it is found that the proposed mean subset method has superior prediction performance than prediction based on the best subset method, and in some settings also better than the ridge regression and lasso methods. The conclusions drawn from the Monte Carlo study is corroborated in an example in which prediction is made using spectroscopic data.",2002,Technometrics

Regularization and Variable Selection with Copula Prior,"In this work, we show that under specific choices of the copula, the lasso, elastic net, and $g$-prior are particular cases of `copula prior,' for regularization and variable selection method. We present `lasso with Gauss copula prior' and `lasso with t-copula prior.' The simulation study and real-world data for regression, classification, and large time-series data show that the `copula prior' often outperforms the lasso and elastic net while having a comparable sparsity of representation. Also, the copula prior encourages a grouping effect. The strongly correlated predictors tend to be in or out of the model collectively under the copula prior. The `copula prior' is a generic method, which can be used to define the new prior distribution. The application of copulas in modeling prior distribution for Bayesian methodology has not been explored much. We present the resampling-based optimization procedure to handle big data with copula prior.",2017,arXiv: Methodology

Learning Transportation Mode Choice for Context-Aware Services with Directed-Graph-Guided Fused Lasso from GPS Trajectory Data,"Mobility profiles of users play a crucial role in a wide range of context-aware computing and services. Travel mode choice, as a representative feature of mobility profiles, is one of the important components in travel demand and future planning of transportation systems. Transportation mode choice has been widely studied based on the random utility model and decision making methods which haven't considered the correlation among features influencing transportation mode choice. This paper presents a data driven model to analyze transportation mode choice given transportation information. The contributions of this paper lie in the following two aspects. On one hand, we propose a travel mode choice model considering the correlation among influencing features of mode. And the relevant features related to the mode choice are redefined and considered to improve the final efficiency and effectiveness. On the other hand, we propose a directed-graph-guided fused lasso method to depict the correlation rules among features. The lasso method can reduce the redundant information to improve the speed of convergence and accuracy of analysis. Three different models namely standard lasso, graph-guided fused lasso and spatio-functionally weighted regression based models, are compared with our model and tested with the GPS trajectory data in Beijing. As a result, we achieved better performance than other compared models.",2017,2017 IEEE International Conference on Web Services (ICWS)
The proximal-proximal gradient algorithm,"We consider the problem of minimizing a convex objective which is the sum of a smooth part, with Lipschitz continuous gradient, and a nonsmooth part. Inspired by various applications, we focus on the case when the nonsmooth part is a composition of a proper closed convex function P and a nonzero affine map, with the proximal mappings of \tau P, \tau > 0, easy to compute. In this case, a direct application of the widely used proximal gradient algorithm does not necessarily lead to easy subproblems. In view of this, we propose a new algorithm, the proximal-proximal gradient algorithm, which admits easy subproblems. Our algorithm reduces to the proximal gradient algorithm if the affine map is just the identity map and the stepsizes are suitably chosen, and it is equivalent to applying a variant of the alternating minimization algorithm [35] to the dual problem. Moreover, it is closely related to inexact proximal gradient algorithms [29,33]. We show that the whole sequence generated from the algorithm converges to an optimal solution. We also establish an upper bound on iteration complexity. Our numerical experiments on the stochastic realization problem and the logistic fused lasso problem suggest that the algorithm performs reasonably well on large-scale instances.",2013,arXiv: Optimization and Control
Link-data-based approximation of path travel time distribution with Gaussian copula estimated through Lasso,"In this paper, we highlight the characteristics of floating car data, and extend our research on single link to pathes. By the law of total probability, we proposes to approximate the total path travel time distribution by the probability-weighted sum of a series of conditional path travel time distributions, conditioning on the sequence of entering time to the links of the path which is expressed as its corresponding (entering-time) lag vector.Any of such conditional distribution is the sum distribution of a sequence of link travel time distribution with specific dependence structure. The dependent structure is modeled by a lagged Gaussian copula while the marginal distributions are estimated by kernel method.The L1-constrain-minimization(Lasso) method is utilized to obtain an invertible covariance matrix of the Gaussian copula even for limited data. Compare to the iterative type procedure, this approach is efficient when the number of scenarios to visit is limited and it resolve the â€conditional distribution puzzleâ€ in the iterative formulas Keyword: Path Travel Time Distribution, Sum of Dependent Random Variables, Gaussian Copula,Lasso, Lagged Copula, Lag Vector",2009,
Current views on Ljungan virus and its relationship to human diabetes.,"The Ljungan virus (LV), a member of the Parechovirus genus and Picornaviridae family was isolated originally from its wild reservoir, the bank vole (Myodes glareolus) at the Ljungan River in central Sweden [Niklasson et al., 1999]. LV is associated with diseases such as myocarditis, encephalitis, pregnancy related diseases, and diabetes in several species of wild rodent [Niklasson et al., 2006a]. The same outcomes can be induced in mice under controlled laboratory conditions [Niklasson et al., 2006b]. Several mouse and rat animal models used to study diabetes have been found to carry LV naturally [Niklasson et al., 2007]. The role of the viruses in diabetes pathogenesis has been investigated by treating these animals with antiviral compounds [Holmberg et al., 2009]. 
 
 
 
Variation in the incidence of type 1 diabetes has been found to track the fluctuations in native rodent populations in central Sweden. Increased prevalence of antibodies to LV has been detected in Swedish type 1 diabetes cases. However, LV virus has not been isolated and its viral RNA has not been detected in type 1 diabetes. J.

Integrating Biological Knowledge Into Case-Control Analysis Through Iterated Conditional Modes/Medians Algorithm.,"Logistic regression is an effective tool in case-control analysis. With the advanced high throughput technology, a quest to seek a fast and efficient method in fitting high-dimensional logistic regression has gained much interest. An empirical Bayes model for logistic regression is considered in this article. A spike-and-slab prior is used for variable selection purpose, which plays a vital role in building an effective predictive model while making model interpretable. To increase the power of variable selection, we incorporate biological knowledge through the Ising prior. The development of the iterated conditional modes/medians (ICM/M) algorithm is proposed to fit the logistic model that has computational advantage over Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. The implementation of the ICM/M algorithm for both linear and logistic models can be found in R package icmm that is freely available on Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). Simulation studies were carried out to assess the performances of our method, with lasso and adaptive lasso as benchmark. Overall, the simulation studies show that the ICM/M outperform the others in terms of number of false positives and have competitive predictive ability. An application to a real data set from Parkinson's disease study was also carried out for illustration. To identify important variables, our approach provides flexibility to select variables based on local posterior probabilities while controlling false discovery rate at a desired level rather than relying only on regression coefficients.",2019,Journal of computational biology : a journal of computational molecular cell biology

Central double cross-validation for estimating parameters in regression models,"The ridge regression, lasso, elastic net, forward stagewise regression and the least angle regression require a solution path and tuning parameter, Î», to estimate the coefficient vector. Therefore, it is crucial to find the ideal Î». Cross-validation (CV) is the most widely utilized method for choosing the ideal tuning parameter from the solution path. CV is essentially the breaking down of the original sample into two parts. One part is used to develop the regression equation. The regression equation is then applied to the other part to evaluate the risk of every model. Consequently, the final model is the model with smallest estimated risk. However, CV does not provide consistent results because it has overfitting and underfitting effects during the model selection. In the present study, a new method for estimating parameter in best-subset regression called central double cross-validation (CDCV) is proposed. In this method, the CV is run twice with different number of folds. Therefore, CDCV maximizes the usage of available data, enhances the model selection performance and builds a new stable CV curve. The final model with an error of less than ?? standard error above the smallest CV error is chosen. The CDCV was compared to existing CV methods in determining the correct model via a simulation study with different sample size and correlation settings. Simulation study indicates that the proposed CDCV method has the highest percentage of obtaining the right model and the lowest Bayesian information criterion (BIC) value across multiple simulated study settings. The results showed that, CDCV has the ability to select the right model correctly and prevent the model from underfitting and overfitting. Therefore, CDCV is recommended as a good alternative to the existing methods in the simulation settings.",2016,
Studies on the Development of Allassostoma parvum Stunkard,"A little over a decade ago not a single life history was known for North American trematodes and up to the present time only ten, none of which concern amphistomes, have been experimentally established.

"Approximate Recovery in Changepoint Problems, from $\ell_2$ Estimation Error Rates","In the 1-dimensional multiple changepoint detection problem, we prove that any procedure with a fast enough $\ell_2$ error rate, in terms of its estimation of the underlying piecewise constant mean vector, automatically has an (approximate) changepoint screening property---specifically, each true jump in the underlying mean vector has an estimated jump nearby. We also show, again assuming only knowledge of the $\ell_2$ error rate, that a simple post-processing step can be used to eliminate spurious estimated changepoints, and thus delivers an (approximate) changepoint recovery property---specifically, in addition to the screening property described above, we are assured that each estimated jump has a true jump nearby. As a special case, we focus on the application of these results to the 1-dimensional fused lasso, i.e., 1-dimensional total variation denoising, and compare the implications with existing results from the literature. We also study extensions to related problems, such as changepoint detection over graphs.",2016,arXiv: Methodology
Professional Development Through STEM Integration: How Early Career Math and Science Teachers Respond to Experiencing Integrated STEM Tasks,"Teachers often struggle to utilize reform-based teaching strategies in their first few years of teaching for many reasons (Ball, Thames & Phelps, Journal of Teacher Education 59, 389â€“407, 2008; Berlin & White, International Journal of Science and Mathematics Education 8, 97â€“115, 2010; Frykholm & Glasson, School Science and Mathematics 105, 127â€“141, 2005; Lederman & Lederman, Science Teacher Education 24, 1237â€“1240, 2013). An important part of teachersâ€™ learning to implement these pedagogically ambitious strategies is for teachers to experience learning themselves through an immersive experience in the new strategy (Louks-Horsley, Stiles, Mundry, Love & Hewson, Designing professional development for teachers of science and mathematics, 2010). Building on this body of research and a host of recent national education standards documents, this paper explores the various dispositions early career high school science and math teachers from across the USA demonstrate when engaging together as learners in integrated science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) tasks. Embedded within a multi-year professional development program, teachers were engaged in two integrated STEM tasks during two separate professional development experiences. Following the tasks, teachers responded to writing prompts asking them to reflect on their experience during the tasks. Analysis of the reflections about the integrated STEM tasks fell into two broad categories of dispositions: engager and observer. The data suggest various strategies for professional development providers who are interested in providing professional development focused on integrated STEM instruction.",2018,International Journal of Science and Mathematics Education
The Horseshoe-Like Regularization for Feature Subset Selection,"Feature subset selection arises in many high-dimensional applications of statistics, such as compressed sensing and genomics. The l0 penalty is ideal for this task, the caveat being it requires the NP-hard combinatorial evaluation of all models. A recent area of considerable interest is to develop efficient algorithms to fit models with a non-convex lÎ³ penalty for Î³ âˆˆ (0,1), which results in sparser models than the convex l1 or lasso penalty, but is harder to fit. We propose an alternative, termed the horseshoe regularization penalty for feature subset selection, and demonstrate its theoretical and computational advantages. The distinguishing feature from existing non-convex optimization approaches is a full probabilistic representation of the penalty as the negative of the logarithm of a suitable prior, which in turn enables efficient expectation-maximization and local linear approximation algorithms for optimization and MCMC for uncertainty quantification. In synthetic and real data, the resulting algorithms provide better statistical performance, and the computation requires a fraction of time of state-of-the-art non-convex solvers.",2019,
Chemical versus structural defense against fish predation in two dominant soft coral species (Xeniidae) in the Red Sea,"Soft corals of the family Xeniidae are particularly abundant in Red Sea coral reefs. Their success may be partly due to a strong defense mechanism against fish predation. To test this, we conducted field and aquarium experiments in which we assessed the antifeeding effect of secondary metabolites of 2 common xeniid species, Ovabunda crenata and Heteroxenia ghardaqensis. In the field experiment, the metabolites of both investigated species reduced feeding on experimental food pellets in the natural population of Red Sea reef fishes by 86 and 92% for O. crenata and H. ghardaqensis, respectively. In the aquarium experiment, natural concentration of crude extract reduced feeding on experimental food pellets in the common reef fish Thalassoma lunare (moon wrasse) by 83 and 85%, respectively. Moon wrasse feeding was even reduced at extract concentrations as low as 12.5% of the natural concentration in living soft coral tissues. To assess the potential of a structural anti-feeding defence, sclerites of O. crenata were extracted and mixed into food pellets at natural, doubled and reduced concentration without and in combination with crude extract at 25% of natural concentration, and tested in an aquarium experiment. The sclerites did not show any effect on the feeding behavior of the moon wrasse indicating that sclerites provide structural support rather than antifeeding defense. H. ghardaqensis lacks sclerites. We conclude that the conspicuous abundance of xeniid soft coral species in the Red Sea is likely a consequence of a strong chemical defence, rather than physical defences, against potential predators.",2015,Aquatic Biology

Optimal Designs for Lasso and Dantzig Selector Using Expander Codes,"We investigate the high-dimensional regression problem using adjacency matrices of unbalanced expander graphs. In this frame, we prove that the â„“2-prediction error and â„“1-risk of the lasso, and the Dantzig selector are optimal up to an explicit multiplicative constant. Thus, we can estimate a high-dimensional target vector with an error term similar to the one obtained in a situation where one knows the support of the largest coordinates in advance. Moreover, we show that these design matrices have an explicit restricted eigenvalue. Precisely, they satisfy the restricted eigenvalue assumption and compatibility condition with an explicit constant. Eventually, we capitalize on the recent construction of unbalanced expander graphs due to Guruswami, Umans, and Vadhan, to provide a deterministic polynomial time construction of these design matrices.",2014,IEEE Transactions on Information Theory
Degrees of Freedom for Piecewise Lipschitz Estimators,"A representation of the degrees of freedom akin to Stein's lemma is given for a class of estimators of a mean value parameter in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Contrary to previous results our representation holds for a range of discontinues estimators. It shows that even though the discontinuities form a Lebesgue null set, they cannot be ignored when computing degrees of freedom. Estimators with discontinuities arise naturally in regression if data driven variable selection is used. Two such examples, namely best subset selection and lasso-OLS, are considered in detail in this paper. For lasso-OLS the general representation leads to an estimate of the degrees of freedom based on the lasso solution path, which in turn can be used for estimating the risk of lasso-OLS. A similar estimate is proposed for best subset selection. The usefulness of the risk estimates for selecting the number of variables is demonstrated via simulations with a particular focus on lasso-OLS.",2016,arXiv: Statistics Theory
Use of the Adaptive LASSO Method to Identify PM2.5 Components Associated with Blood Pressure in Elderly Men: The Veterans Affairs Normative Aging Study,"BACKGROUND
PM2.5 (particulate matter â‰¤ 2.5 Î¼m) has been associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes, but it is unclear whether specific PM2.5 components, particularly metals, may be responsible for cardiovascular effects.


OBJECTIVES
We aimed to determine which PM2.5 components are associated with blood pressure in a longitudinal cohort.


METHODS
We fit linear mixed-effects models with the adaptive LASSO penalty to longitudinal data from 718 elderly men in the Veterans Affairs Normative Aging Study, 1999-2010. We controlled for PM2.5 mass, age, body mass index, use of antihypertensive medication (ACE inhibitors, non-ophthalmic beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, diuretics, and angiotensin receptor antagonists), smoking status, alcohol intake, years of education, temperature, and season as fixed effects in the models, and additionally applied the adaptive LASSO method to select PM2.5 components associated with blood pressure. Final models were identified by the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).


RESULTS
For systolic blood pressure (SBP), nickel (Ni) and sodium (Na) were selected by the adaptive LASSO, whereas only Ni was selected for diastolic blood pressure (DBP). An interquartile range increase (2.5 ng/m3) in 7-day moving-average Ni was associated with 2.48-mmHg (95% CI: 1.45, 3.50 mmHg) increase in SBP and 2.22-mmHg (95% CI: 1.69, 2.75 mmHg) increase in DBP, respectively. Associations were comparable when the analysis was restricted to study visits with PM2.5 below the 75th percentile of the distribution (12 Î¼g/m3).


CONCLUSIONS
Our study suggested that exposure to ambient Ni was associated with increased blood pressure independent of PM2.5 mass in our study population of elderly men. Further research is needed to confirm our findings, assess generalizability to other populations, and identify potential mechanisms for Ni effects.

Defenses of Caribbean sponges against invertebrate predators. I. Assays with hermit crabs,"Hermit crabs (Decapoda: Anomura) are typically omnivorous and are common on Caribbean coral reefs. Sponges are sessile, fleshy, and high in protein and energy content, yet hermit crabs do not appear to prey on them. Assays were performed with the Caribbean reef hermit crab Paguristes punticeps to determine whether secondary metabolites or skeletal elements of Caribbean sponges that were incorporated into artificial foods affected feeding. Of 30 sponge species assayed, 26 (87 %) yielded organic extracts that deterred feedlng by P punticeps. There was substantial interspecific and intraspecific vanabllity in patterns of chemical deterrence. Sponges of the families Axinellidae, Agelasidae, Aplysinidae, Aplysinellidae, and Thorectidae typically yielded deterrent extracts. Three common sponge species, Mycale laevis, Callyspongla vaginalis, and Niphates erecta, were consistently non-deterrent, while other species, including Spheciospongja othella, Chondrilla nucula, Callyspongia plicifera. Niphates digitalis, and Xestospongia muta, were variably deterrent. These results are in general agreement with those of a previous survey of Caribbean sponge chemical defenses using the common reef fish Thalassoma bifasciatum. However, some results differed: Geodia neptuni and Iotrochota birotulata were consistently palatable to T. bifasciatum, but were deterrent to P. punticeps. Several species that were consistently deterrent to 7 bifasciatum were variably deterrent to P punticeps, including Aplysina caulifornus, Aplysina fulva, Ircinia strobilina, Amphimedon compressa, and Mycale laxjssima. Neither spicules (from Agelas clathrodes, Ectyoplasia feros, and Xestospongia muta) nor splculated spongin skeleton (from A. clathrodes and X. muta) deterred feeding by P, punticeps. Spicules and spiculated spongin were similarly non-deterrent to the fish T bifasciatum in a previous survey. The results of this study further suggest that chemical defenses are important in the ecology of Caribbean sponges, while skeletal components do not serve an antipredatory function.",2000,Marine Ecology Progress Series
Regularized Structural Equation Modeling.,"A new method is proposed that extends the use of regularization in both lasso and ridge regression to structural equation models. The method is termed regularized structural equation modeling (RegSEM). RegSEM penalizes specific parameters in structural equation models, with the goal of creating easier to understand and simpler models. Although regularization has gained wide adoption in regression, very little has transferred to models with latent variables. By adding penalties to specific parameters in a structural equation model, researchers have a high level of flexibility in reducing model complexity, overcoming poor fitting models, and the creation of models that are more likely to generalize to new samples. The proposed method was evaluated through a simulation study, two illustrative examples involving a measurement model, and one empirical example involving the structural part of the model to demonstrate RegSEM's utility.",2016,Structural equation modeling : a multidisciplinary journal
Markov chain Monte Carlo with the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation,"The Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) has established itself as a widely used method for approximate inference on Bayesian hierarchical models which can be represented as a latent Gaussian model (LGM). INLA is based on producing an accurate approximation to the posterior marginal distributions of the parameters in the model and some other quantities of interest by using repeated approximations to intermediate distributions and integrals that appear in the computation of the posterior marginals. INLA focuses on models whose latent effects are a Gaussian Markov random field. For this reason, we have explored alternative ways of expanding the number of possible models that can be fitted using the INLA methodology. In this paper, we present a novel approach that combines INLA and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The aim is to consider a wider range of models that can be fitted with INLA only when some of the parameters of the model have been fixed. We show how new values of these parameters can be drawn from their posterior by using conditional models fitted with INLA and standard MCMC algorithms, such as Metropolisâ€“Hastings. Hence, this will extend the use of INLA to fit models that can be expressed as a conditional LGM. Also, this new approach can be used to build simpler MCMC samplers for complex models as it allows sampling only on a limited number of parameters in the model. We will demonstrate how our approach can extend the class of models that could benefit from INLA, and how the R-INLA package will ease its implementation. We will go through simple examples of this new approach before we discuss more advanced applications with datasets taken from the relevant literature. In particular, INLA within MCMC will be used to fit models with Laplace priors in a Bayesian Lasso model, imputation of missing covariates in linear models, fitting spatial econometrics models with complex nonlinear terms in the linear predictor and classification of data with mixture models. Furthermore, in some of the examples we could exploit INLA within MCMC to make joint inference on an ensemble of model parameters.",2018,Statistics and Computing
Stromal Gene Expression is Predictive for Metastatic Primary Prostate Cancer.,"BACKGROUND
Clinical grading systems using clinical features alongside nomograms lack precision in guiding treatment decisions in prostate cancer (PCa). There is a critical need for identification of biomarkers that can more accurately stratify patients with primary PCa.


OBJECTIVE
To identify a robust prognostic signature to better distinguish indolent from aggressive prostate cancer (PCa).


DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS
To develop the signature, whole-genome and whole-transcriptome sequencing was conducted on five PCa patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models collected from independent foci of a single primary tumor and exhibiting variable metastatic phenotypes. Multiple independent clinical cohorts including an intermediate-risk cohort were used to validate the biomarkers.


OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
The outcome measurement defining aggressive PCa was metastasis following radical prostatectomy. A generalized linear model with lasso regularization was used to build a 93-gene stroma-derived metastasis signature (SDMS). The SDMS association with metastasis was assessed using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Performance was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC) for the receiver operating characteristic, and Kaplan-Meier curves. Univariable and multivariable regression models were used to compare the SDMS alongside clinicopathological variables and reported signatures. AUC was assessed to determine if SDMS is additive or synergistic to previously reported signatures.


RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS
A close association between stromal gene expression and metastatic phenotype was observed. Accordingly, the SDMS was modeled and validated in multiple independent clinical cohorts. Patients with higher SDMS scores were found to have worse prognosis. Furthermore, SDMS was an independent prognostic factor, can stratify risk in intermediate-risk PCa, and can improve the performance of other previously reported signatures.


CONCLUSIONS
Profiling of stromal gene expression led to development of an SDMS that was validated as independently prognostic for the metastatic potential of prostate tumors.


PATIENT SUMMARY
Our stroma-derived metastasis signature can predict the metastatic potential of early stage disease and will strengthen decisions regarding selection of active surveillance versus surgery and/or radiation therapy for prostate cancer patients. Furthermore, profiling of stroma cells should be more consistent than profiling of diverse cellular populations of heterogeneous tumors.",2018,European urology
Two new combinations in Persicaria sect. Echinocaulon (Polygonaceae: Persicarieae),"Persicaria (Linnaeus 1753: 360) Miller (1754) is a monophyletic genus including about 150 species mainly distributed in the northern temperate regions but also extends to tropical regions (Brandbyge 1993). The sect. Echinocaulon (Meisner 1832: 58) Gross (1913: 27), which is characterized in having recurved prickles on stems, petioles, and abaxial surfaces of major leaf veins, often scandent habit and hastate or sagittate leaf base (Galasso et al. 2009, Park 1988), was traditionally placed under Polygonum Linnaeus (1753: 360) (see e.g., Meisner 1856, Bentham & Hooker 1880, Dammer 1893, Steward 1930, Tutin et al. 1991, Li 1998, Li et al. 2003). On the basis of recent molecular studies (e.g., Kim & Donoghue 2008a, 2008b, Galasso et al. 2009, Sanchez et al. 2009, 2011), as well as morphological and anatomical investigations (Haraldson 1978, Ronse Decraene & Akeroyd 1988, Ronse Decraene et al. 2000), the taxon Echinocaulon has been confirmed to be placed in Persicaria .",2015,Phytotaxa
What explains health in persons with visual impairment?,"BackgroundVisual impairment is associated with important limitations in functioning. The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) adopted by the World Health Organisation (WHO) relies on a globally accepted framework for classifying problems in functioning and the influence of contextual factors. Its comprehensive perspective, including biological, individual and social aspects of health, enables the ICF to describe the whole health experience of persons with visual impairment. The objectives of this study are (1) to analyze whether the ICF can be used to comprehensively describe the problems in functioning of persons with visual impairment and the environmental factors that influence their lives and (2) to select the ICF categories that best capture self-perceived health of persons with visual impairment.MethodsData from 105 persons with visual impairment were collected, including socio-demographic data, vision-related data, the Extended ICF Checklist and the visual analogue scale of the EuroQoL-5D, to assess self-perceived health. Descriptive statistics and a Group Lasso regression were performed. The main outcome measures were functioning defined as impairments in Body functions and Body structures, limitations in Activities and restrictions in Participation, influencing Environmental factors and self-perceived health.ResultsIn total, 120 ICF categories covering a broad range of Body functions, Body structures, aspects of Activities and Participation and Environmental factors were identified. Thirteen ICF categories that best capture self-perceived health were selected based on the Group Lasso regression. While Activities-and-Participation categories were selected most frequently, the greatest impact on self-perceived health was found in Body-functions categories. The ICF can be used as a framework to comprehensively describe the problems of persons with visual impairment and the Environmental factors which influence their lives.ConclusionsThere are plenty of ICF categories, Environmental-factors categories in particular, which are relevant to persons with visual impairment, but have hardly ever been taken into consideration in literature and visual impairment-specific patient-reported outcome measures.",2014,Health and Quality of Life Outcomes
Lazy lasso for local regression,"Locally weighted regression is a technique that predicts the response for new data items from their neighbors in the training data set, where closer data items are assigned higher weights in the prediction. However, the original method may suffer from overfitting and fail to select the relevant variables. In this paper we propose combining a regularization approach with locally weighted regression to achieve sparse models. Specifically, the lasso is a shrinkage and selection method for linear regression. We present an algorithm that embeds lasso in an iterative procedure that alternatively computes weights and performs lasso-wise regression. The algorithm is tested on three synthetic scenarios and two real data sets. Results show that the proposed method outperforms linear and local models for several kinds of scenarios.",2012,Computational Statistics
Porous topologies of (im)perceptibilities as creative process,"Two reflections from theoretical cosmology provide the inspiration for this paper. The first is an acknowledgement that light is but a one-dimensional signal of (non)human knowability of the properties of the universe. The second is the claim that properties as-of-yet unknowable are mathematically thinkable, albeit in the absence of observational verification. Current cosmological debates concerning the (non)existence of manifold topologies of the multiverse (e.g. Smolin 2015) provide a rich context in which to both stay with and trouble claims for (un)knowability as a resource for tentatively grasping the radically insensible (Yusoff 2013). Indeed the deep recesses of the (non)existent multiverse promise to usefully probe further the very meanings of (non)human perceptibility. This paper will practice a recent interdisciplinary experiment between an artist, anthropologist and cosmologist as they exchange theoretical and material resources with which they individually and collectively trouble the limits of (im)perceptibility posed by the example given. Theoretical reflection on the status of mathematics as (non)human signal, will tentatively steer between accounts of mathematical ontology (Badiou, Meillassoux) and feminist materialist consideration of mathematics as human-nonhuman semiotic exchange (e.g. Kirby). We reflect upon the problem of seeking â€˜illuminationâ€™ of dark objects through the example of Art practice, where â€˜knowingâ€™ is deliberately postponed and a state of being â€˜in the darkâ€™ is essential to enriched understanding (Jones 2013).The paper will be framed by a wider-arching question concerning the possibilities of the utter (ir)relevance of such radically â€˜dark spacesâ€™ for anthropocenic thinking.",2015,

Performance of some variable selection methods when multicollinearity is present,"Abstract Variable selection is one of the important practical issues for many scientific engineers. Although the PLS (partial least squares) regression combined with the VIP (variable importance in the projection) scores is often used when the multicollinearity is present among variables, there are few guidelines about its uses as well as its performance. The purpose of this paper is to explore the nature of the VIP method and to compare with other methods through computer simulation experiments. We design 108 experiments where observations are generated from true models considering four factorsâ€“the proportion of the number of relevant predictors, the magnitude of correlations between predictors, the structure of regression coefficients, and the magnitude of signal to noise. Confusion matrix is adopted to evaluate the performance of PLS, the Lasso, and stepwise method. We also discuss the proper cutoff value of the VIP method to increase its performance. Some practical hints for the use of the VIP method are given as simulation results.",2005,Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems
Talasoterapia en la isla de Porto Santo del archipiÃ©lago de Madeira: hechos y perspectivas,"espanolLa talasoterapia por definicion es el uso de agua de mar, productos del mar (arena, barro, sal, algas, aerosoles...) y el clima costero como una forma de terapia. Sin embargo, la definicion real de la talasoterapia es mas precisa si se considera el uso combinado con fines preventivos y terapeuticos del agua de mar y los productos derivados del mar, bajo asesoramiento y supervision medica, dentro de las instalaciones adecuadas de los establecimientos ubicados cerca del mar. La talasoterapia es uno de los subproductos de los programas de Turismo de Salud y Bienestar que comprenden actividades saludables como: Termalismo / Crenoterapia (usando agua mineral natural y barro / peloide natural en los Centros termales como recursos saludables); Barroterapia / Peloterapia (utilizando barro / peloide, que en general puede ser de origen marino o de agua mineral natural, como recurso saludable); Psamoterapia o Arenoterapia (utilizando arenas naturales especiales derivada del mar, como recurso saludable); Haloterapia (usando sal marina como recurso saludable); y Climatoterapia (utilizando el clima marino como un recurso saludable). Todas estas actividades saludables, turisticas y economicas se llevan a cabo en centros termales y balnearios que, por regla general, ofrecen solo una actividad saludable especializada utilizando agua mineral natural o agua de mar o productos derivados del agua mineral natural o marina, como barro, arena y sal. El uso terapeutico de cualquiera de estos recursos naturales tiene indicaciones y contraindicaciones, por lo que debe contar con la participacion (diagnostico, prescripcion y supervision) de personal medico especializado, el control de seguridad sanitaria de los recursos naturales, las instalaciones y los equipamientos que tambien lo requieren. Tales condiciones son requisitos fundamentales para obtener la necesaria acreditacion y certificacion. La salud y el bienestar estan intrinsecamente conectados, y el turismo de salud y bienestar es fundamental en lo que se refiere a la atractividad y competitividad de los destinos turisticos. En Portugal, improbable en otros paises como Francia y Espana, no existe legislacion para los 6 (seis) centros de talasoterapia existentes, la legislacion (Decreto-Lei no 142/2004) que existe es para los 41 (cuarenta y uno) establecimientos balnearios. En Lo Pagan, Mar Menor, Murcia, Espana, talasoterapia y peloterapia se practican actualmente en el mismo centro, aunque en instalaciones separadas y adecuadas. En la Isla de Porto Santo del archipielago de Madeira, a escala mundial, es uno de los territorios mas raros, donde en el mismo Centro de Talasoterapia, el agua de mar y los productos derivados, arena, barro, algas, ... se pueden usar juntos, naturalmente, en Instalaciones adecuadas individuales y separadas. Sin embargo, actualmente las aplicaciones de agua de mar (inhalacion, bano y algas marinas) solo se aplicam en el Vila Baleira Hotel Resort & Thalasso Spa, mientras que los banos de arena solo se ofrecen en la clinica y spa del Porto Santo Hotel Geomedicine. EnglishThalassotherapy by definition is the use of seawater, sea products (sand, mud, salt, algae, aerosolsâ€¦) and seaside climate as a form of therapy. However, the actual definition of Thalassotherapy is more precise considering the combined use with preventive and therapeutic purposes of sea water and sea derived products, under counseling and medical supervision, inside the adequate facilities of establishments located near by the sea. Thalassotherapy is one of the by-products of Health and Wellness Tourism programs which comprise healthy activities such: Thermalism/Crenotherapy (using natural mineral water and natural mud/peloid in Thermal Resorts as healthy resources); Mudtherapy/Pelotherapy (using mud/peloid, that as a rule could be derived from the sea or from natural mineral water, as healthy resource); Psammotherapy or Arenotherapy (using special natural sands as a rule derived from the sea, as healthy resource); Halotherapy (using sea salt as healthy resource); and Climatotherapy (using seaside climate as healthy resource). All these healthy, touristic and economic activities take place in Health Resorts and spas that as a rule provide just one specialized healthy activity using or natural mineral water, or seawater, or sea and natural mineral water derived products such as mud, sand and salt. The therapeutic use of any of these natural resources has indications and contra-indications, reason why it should have the involvement (diagnosis, prescription and supervision) of specialized medical staff, the sanitary safety control of the natural resources, facilities and equipments being required too. Such conditions are fundamental requisites for getting the necessary accreditation and certification.

Frenelopsis (Coniferales: Cheirolepidiaceae) And Related Male Organ Genera From The Lower Cretaceous Of Spain,"Vegetative plant remains and microsporangiate cones, related to the fossil genera Frenelopsis and Classostrobus respectively, were studied in three localities from the Lower Cretaceous of the Pyrenees and Iberian Ranges (Spain). Sterile remains belong to three different species: F. Rubiesensis Barale, F. Ugnaensis sp. nov. and F. Turolensis sp. nov. The male cones Classostrobus ugnaensis sp. nov. and C. Turolensis sp. nov. are associated with the two latter species respectively, and C. Turolensis is found in connection with F. Turolensis. Internodes of F. Ugnaensis display small hemispherical papillae and long conical hairs covering the entire cuticle surface, while F. Turolensis has a strip of hairs near the leaf margin, in addition to more massive outer stomatal papillae and higher stomatal density. The tiny cones of C. Ugnaensis bear microsporophyll cuticles capped with vermiculate flattened papillae and a fringe of marginal hairs, while C. Turolensis has a central area of microsporophylls covered by long conical hairs. Sedimentological and taphonomic analyses show that the assemblages studied belong to a wide spectrum of habitats. These indicate that Spanish Lower Cretaceous frenelopsids were xeromorphic plants, able to adapt to helophytic and riparian habitats, and grew in brackish coastal marshes and fluvioâ€“lacustrine freshwater environments.",2002,Palaeontology
What is the US Comparative Advantage in Entrepreneurship? Evidence from Israeli Migration to the United States,"This paper investigates the underlying sources of the US entrepreneurial ecosystem's comparative advantage by assessing the benefits Israeli technology startups derive from migrating to the US. To address positive sorting into migration we adopt three complementary approaches, which include examining exogenous institutional constraints on the startups' ability to migrate, estimating a double-LASSO regression, and estimating a startup fixed-effects model exploiting across migrant variation in migration age. We show that migrants raise larger funding amounts and are more likely both to apply for a trademark and to be acquired than non-migrants. Conditional on an acquisition, migrants also achieve a higher transaction value. However, they do not hold more patents than non-migrants. We conclude that the US entrepreneurial ecosystemâ€™s comparative advantage vis-a-vis other innovative economies, such as Israel, arises from a multitude of sources that produce sizeable gains for startups. These sources are high investor availability, a large consumer market, and a developed market for acquisitions.",2019,

Estimating Influenza Outbreaks Using Both Search Engine Query Data and Social Media Data in South Korea,"BACKGROUND
As suggested as early as in 2006, logs of queries submitted to search engines seeking information could be a source for detection of emerging influenza epidemics if changes in the volume of search queries are monitored (infodemiology). However, selecting queries that are most likely to be associated with influenza epidemics is a particular challenge when it comes to generating better predictions.


OBJECTIVE
In this study, we describe a methodological extension for detecting influenza outbreaks using search query data; we provide a new approach for query selection through the exploration of contextual information gleaned from social media data. Additionally, we evaluate whether it is possible to use these queries for monitoring and predicting influenza epidemics in South Korea.


METHODS
Our study was based on freely available weekly influenza incidence data and query data originating from the search engine on the Korean website Daum between April 3, 2011 and April 5, 2014. To select queries related to influenza epidemics, several approaches were applied: (1) exploring influenza-related words in social media data, (2) identifying the chief concerns related to influenza, and (3) using Web query recommendations. Optimal feature selection by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) and support vector machine for regression (SVR) were used to construct a model predicting influenza epidemics.


RESULTS
In total, 146 queries related to influenza were generated through our initial query selection approach. A considerable proportion of optimal features for final models were derived from queries with reference to the social media data. The SVR model performed well: the prediction values were highly correlated with the recent observed influenza-like illness (r=.956; P<.001) and virological incidence rate (r=.963; P<.001).


CONCLUSIONS
These results demonstrate the feasibility of using search queries to enhance influenza surveillance in South Korea. In addition, an approach for query selection using social media data seems ideal for supporting influenza surveillance based on search query data.",2016,Journal of Medical Internet Research
Integrated analysis of DNA-methylation and gene expression using high-dimensional penalized regression: a cohort study on bone mineral density in postmenopausal women,"BackgroundUsing high-dimensional penalized regression we studied genome-wide DNA-methylation in bone biopsies of 80 postmenopausal women in relation to their bone mineral density (BMD). The women showed BMD varying from severely osteoporotic to normal. Global gene expression data from the same individuals was available, and since DNA-methylation often affects gene expression, the overall aim of this paper was to include both of these omics data sets into an integrated analysis.MethodsThe classical penalized regression uses one penalty, but we incorporated individual penalties for each of the DNA-methylation sites. These individual penalties were guided by the strength of association between DNA-methylations and gene transcript levels. DNA-methylations that were highly associated to one or more transcripts got lower penalties and were therefore favored compared to DNA-methylations showing less association to expression. Because of the complex pathways and interactions among genes, we investigated both the association between DNA-methylations and their corresponding cis gene, as well as the association between DNA-methylations and trans-located genes. Two integrating penalized methods were used: first, an adaptive group-regularized ridge regression, and secondly, variable selection was performed through a modified version of the weighted lasso.ResultsWhen information from gene expressions was integrated, predictive performance was considerably improved, in terms of predictive mean square error, compared to classical penalized regression without data integration. We found a 14.7% improvement in the ridge regression case and a 17% improvement for the lasso case. Our version of the weighted lasso with data integration found a list of 22 interesting methylation sites. Several corresponded to genes that are known to be important in bone formation. Using BMD as response and these 22 methylation sites as covariates, least square regression analyses resulted in R2=0.726, comparable to an average R2=0.438 for 10000 randomly selected groups of DNA-methylations with group size 22.ConclusionsTwo recent types of penalized regression methods were adapted to integrate DNA-methylation and their association to gene expression in the analysis of bone mineral density. In both cases predictions clearly benefit from including the additional information on gene expressions.",2018,BMC Medical Genomics
Fine structure of the leaf epidermis of Thalassodendron ciliatum (Forsk.) den Hartog,"Abstract Ultrastructural features of leaf blade epidermal cells of the marine angiosperm Thalassodendron ciliatum (Forsk.) den Hartog are described. The cells resemble transfer cells since they possess a highly invaginated plasmalemma with which numerous mitochondria are often associated. However, wall ingrowths as known in transfer cells of terrestrial plants, are absent. The plasmalemma is investigated around loosely-distributed fibrillar material present within a labyrinthine extracytoplasmic space. This material differs from the material that comprises the cell walls. The cytoplasm of the cells is rich in ribosomes. As in epidermal cells of other marine angiosperms, chloroplasts feature prominently. Other cytoplasmic components include microbodies, lipid droplets, unusual membrane-bound spherical osmiophilic bodies, and relatively few microtubules, dictyosomes and ER profiles. A thin, but distinct cuticle covers the leaf surface. The outer tangential cell wall is about twice as thick as the other walls and has an interesting structure; the innermost portion of this wall often stains more intensely than the rest of the wall; wall striations, adjacent to this intensely-staining layer, are more prominent here than in the other walls; certain layers of the striated portion of the wall appear to have a porous texture; and cavities, generally similar to the subcuticular cavities of the marine angiosperm Zostera capensis Setchell, occur in the midregion of the wall, as well as beneath the cuticle. An extremely small opening is found in the cuticle that overlies a subcuticular cavity. The presence of an enlarged plasmalemma, a fenestrated cuticle and a partially porous outer wall suggests that these cells probably participate in absorptive and/or secretory or excretory processes.",1982,Aquatic Botany
Machine Learning Prediction of Mortality and Hospitalization in Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction.,"OBJECTIVES
This study sought to develop models for predicting mortality and heart failure (HF) hospitalization for outpatients with HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) in the TOPCAT (Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure with an Aldosterone Antagonist) trial.


BACKGROUND
Although risk assessment models are available for patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction, few have assessed the risks of death and hospitalization in patients with HFpEF.


METHODS
The following 5 methods: logistic regression with a forward selection of variables; logistic regression with a lasso regularization for variable selection; random forest (RF); gradient descent boosting; and support vector machine, were used to train models for assessing risks of mortality and HF hospitalization through 3 years of follow-up and were validated using 5-fold cross-validation. Model discrimination and calibration were estimated using receiver-operating characteristic curves and Brier scores, respectively. The top prediction variables were assessed by using the best performing models, using the incremental improvement of each variable in 5-fold cross-validation.


RESULTS
The RF was the best performing model with a mean C-statistic of 0.72 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.69 to 0.75) for predicting mortality (Brier score: 0.17), and 0.76 (95%Â CI: 0.71 to 0.81) for HF hospitalization (Brier score: 0.19). Blood urea nitrogen levels, body mass index, and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) subscale scores were strongly associated with mortality, whereas hemoglobin level, blood urea nitrogen, time since previous HF hospitalization, and KCCQ scores were the most significant predictors of HF hospitalization.


CONCLUSIONS
These models predict the risks of mortality and HF hospitalization in patients with HFpEF and emphasize the importance of health status data in determining prognosis.

Identification of an energy metabolism-related gene signature in ovarian cancer prognosis,"Changes in energy metabolism may be potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for cancer as they frequently occur within cancer cells. However, basic cancer research has failed to reach a consistent conclusion on the function(s) of mitochondria in energy metabolism. The significance of energy metabolism in the prognosis of ovarian cancer remains unclear; thus, there remains an urgent need to systematically analyze the characteristics and clinical value of energy metabolism in ovarian cancer. Based on gene expression patterns, the present study aimed to analyze energy metabolismâ€‘associated characteristics to evaluate the prognosis of patients with ovarian cancer. A total of 39Â energy metabolismâ€‘related genes significantly associated with prognosis were obtained, and three molecular subtypes were identified by nonnegative matrix factorization clustering, among which the C1 subtype was associated with poor clinical outcomes of ovarian cancer. The immune response was enhanced in the tumor microenvironment. A total of 888Â differentially expressed genes were identified in C1 compared with the other subtypes, and the results of the pathway enrichment analysis demonstrated that they were enriched in the 'PI3Kâ€‘Akt signaling pathway', 'cAMP signaling pathway', 'ECMâ€‘receptor interaction' and other pathways associated with the development and progression of tumors. Finally, eight characteristic genes (tolloidâ€‘like 1 gene, type XVI collagen, prostaglandin F2Î±, cartilage intermediate layer proteinÂ 2, kinesin family member 26b, interferon inducible proteinÂ 27, growth arrestâ€‘specific geneÂ 1 and chemokine receptorÂ 7) were obtained through LASSO feature selection; and a number of them have been demonstrated to be associated with ovarian cancer progression. In addition, Cox regression analysis was performed to establish an 8â€‘gene signature, which was determined to be an independent prognostic factor for patients with ovarian cancer and could stratify sample risk in the training, test and external validation datasets (P<0.01; AUCÂ >0.8). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis results revealed that the 8â€‘gene signature was involved in important biological processes and pathways of ovarian cancer. In conclusion, the present study established an 8â€‘gene signature associated with metabolic genes, which may provide new insights into the effects of energy metabolism on ovarian cancer. The 8â€‘gene signature may serve as an independent prognostic factor for ovarian cancer patients.",2020,Oncology Reports
Penalized Single-Index Quantile Regression,"The single-index (SI) regression and single-index quantile (SIQ) estimation methods product linear combinations of all the original predictors. However, it is possible that there are many unimportant predictors within the original predictors. Thus, the precision of parameter estimation as well as the accuracy of prediction will be effected by the existence of those unimportant predictors when the previous methods are used. In this article, an extension of the SIQ method of Wu et al. (2010) has been proposed, which considers Lasso and Adaptive Lasso for estimation and variable selection. Computational algorithms have been developed in order to calculate the penalized SIQ estimates. A simulation study and a real data application have been used to assess the performance of the methods under consideration.",2013,International Journal of Statistics and Probability
Analysis of Genomic and Transcriptomic Variations as Prognostic Signature for Lung Adenocarcinoma.,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of the largest number of deaths worldwide and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common form of lung cancer. In this study, we carried out an integrated meta-analysis of the mutations including single-nucleotide variations (SNVs), the copy number variations (CNVs), RNA-seq and clinical data of patients with LUAD downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We integrated significant SNV and CNV genes, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and the DEGs in active subnetworks to construct a prognosis signature. Cox proportional hazards model (LOOCV) with Lasso penalty was used to identify the best gene signature among different gene categories. The patients in both training and test data were clustered into high-risk and low-risk groups by using risk scores of the patients calculated based on selected gene signature. We generated a 12-gene signature (DEPTOR, ZBTB16, BCHE, MGLL, MASP2, TNNI2, RAPGEF3, SGK2, MYO1A, CYP24A1, PODXL2, CCNA1) for overall survival prediction. The survival time of high-risk and low-risk groups was significantly different. This 12-gene signature could predict prognosis and they are potential predictors for the survival of the patients with LUAD.",2019,arXiv: Genomics
Development and validation of a panel of five proteins as blood biomarkers for early detection of colorectal cancer,"Objective
Reliable noninvasive biomarkers for early detection of colorectal cancer (CRC) are highly desirable for efficient population-based screening with high adherence rates. We aimed to discover and validate blood-based protein markers for the early detection of CRC.


Patients and methods
A two-stage design with a discovery and a validation set was used. In the discovery phase, plasma levels of 92 protein markers and serum levels of TP53 autoantibody were measured in 226 clinically recruited CRC patients and 118 controls who were free of colorectal neoplasms at screening colonoscopy. An algorithm predicting the presence of CRC was derived by Lasso regression and validated in a validation set consisting of all available 41 patients with CRC and a representative sample of 106 participants with advanced adenomas and 107 controls free of neoplasm from a large screening colonoscopy cohort (N=6018). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were conducted to evaluate the diagnostic performance of individual biomarkers and biomarker combinations.


Results
An algorithm based on growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15), amphiregulin (AREG), Fas antigen ligand (FasL), Fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt3L) and TP53 autoantibody was constructed. In the validation set, the areas under the curves of this five-marker algorithm were 0.82 (95% CI, 0.74-0.90) for detecting CRC and 0.60 (95% CI, 0.52-0.69) for detecting advanced adenomas. At cutoffs yielding 90% specificity, the sensitivities (95% CI) for detecting CRC and advanced adenomas were 56.4% (38.4%-71.8%) and 22.0% (13.4%-35.4%), respectively. The five-marker panel showed similar diagnostic efficacy for the detection of early- and late-stage CRC.


Conclusion
The identified most promising biomarkers could contribute to the development of powerful blood-based tests for CRC screening in the future.",2017,Clinical Epidemiology
"Sexual Selection and Male Characteristics in the Bluehead Wrasse, Thalassoma Bifasciatum: Mating Site Acquisition, Mating Site Defense, and Female Choice.","Through a series of replacement experiments with the bluehead wrasse, Thalassoma bifasciatum, we have identified male morphological characteristics that appear to be under phenotypic sexual selection. We were particularly interested in whether the various sources of sexual selection (male-male competition for unoccupied mating sites, defense of mating sites against small males, and female choice of males) were (1) independently associated with different phenotypic characteristics; (2) jointly affected the same characteristic in the same way; or (3) jointly affected the same characteristic in an antagonistic fashion. We replaced the resident large, brightly colored Terminal Phase (TP) males on a reef with the same number of TP males from other reefs. When transplanted, these males contest with each other to take over mating sites. The transplanted group of males were then scored for three components of fitness: (1) the quality of the site obtained through competition with other large males; (2) the male's ability to defend arriving females from small intruding males; and (3) changes in female visits to the site once the new male takes over. The first and second components are part of intrasexual selection; the third represents intersexual selection. We measured the opportunity for selection by partitioning variance in mating success, and measured the direct effects of sexual selection by estimating the covariance between morphology and fitness components. Opportunities for selection: Because females generally remain faithful to particular mating sites, most (54%) of the explainable variation in male mating success is due to the acquisition of a particular mating territory, which is the outcome of competition among TP males. There was less variation in mating success due to shifts in site use by females and defense of females against the intrusions of smaller males, but all components were significant. Effects of selection: Success in male-male competition among TP males, estimated by the quality of the territory acquired, was positively associated with body length and the relative length of the pectoral fin. Success in territorial defense against small males was primarily related to body length, with lesser contributions from body depth and the area of a white band on the flank. Contribution to fitness through female choice of males was positively associated with white band area. In the two instances where a character was associated with two fitness components, the direction of selection was the same. While body length was positively associated with winning intrasexual contests, it was not correlated to any behavioral measures of aggression. Similarly, the white band associated with attractiveness was not correlated with any aspect of courtship or aggression. Parasite load was uncorrelated with other morphological characters, and did not appear to affect any aspect of sexual selection. There was no evidence for stabilizing selection or significant additional contributions from second-order effects to the fitness surfaces. Fitness functions calculated using cubic splines were generally linear except for body length, which appeared sigmoid in its effect on site acquisition ability; this same feature tended to plateau in its effect on site defense. Analyses of the interactions of selection gradients with reef or experiment indicated that the effect of particular male characters on estimates of fitness was generally homogeneous in both time and space.",1992,Evolution; international journal of organic evolution
LAD-Lasso variable selection for doubly censored median regression models,"ABSTRACT A variable selection procedure based on least absolute deviation (LAD) estimation and adaptive lasso (LAD-Lasso for short) is proposed for median regression models with doubly censored data. The proposed procedure can select significant variables and estimate the parameters simultaneously, and the resulting estimators enjoy the oracle property.

Machine learning approach to reconstructing signalling pathways and interaction networks in biology,"In this doctoral thesis, I present my research into applying machine learning techniques for reconstructing species interaction networks in ecology, reconstructing molecular signalling pathways and gene regulatory networks in systems biology, and inferring parameters in ordinary differential equation (ODE) models of signalling pathways. Together, the methods I have developed for these applications demonstrate the usefulness of machine learning for reconstructing networks and inferring network parameters from data. The thesis consists of three parts. The first part is a detailed comparison of applying static Bayesian networks, relevance vector machines, and linear regression with L1 regularisation (LASSO) to the problem of reconstructing species interaction networks from species absence/presence data in ecology (Faisal et al., 2010). I describe how I generated data from a stochastic population model to test the different methods and how the simulation study led us to introduce spatial autocorrelation as an important covariate. I also show how we used the results of the simulation study to apply the methods to presence/absence data of bird species from the European Bird Atlas. The second part of the thesis describes a time-varying, non-homogeneous dynamic Bayesian network model for reconstructing signalling pathways and gene regulatory networks, based on LÃ¨bre et al. (2010). I show how my work has extended this model to incorporate different types of hierarchical Bayesian information sharing priors and different coupling strategies among nodes in the network. The introduction of these priors reduces the inference uncertainty by putting a penalty on the number of structure changes among network segments separated by inferred changepoints (Dondelinger et al., 2010; Husmeier et al., 2010; Dondelinger et al., 2012b). Using both synthetic and real data, I demonstrate that using information sharing priors leads to a better reconstruction accuracy of the underlying gene regulatory networks, and I compare the different priors and coupling strategies. I show the results of applying the model to gene expression datasets from Drosophila melanogaster and Arabidopsis thaliana, as well as to a synthetic biology gene expression dataset from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In each case, the underlying network is time-varying; for Drosophila melanogaster, as a consequence of measuring gene expression during different developmental stages; for Arabidopsis thaliana, as a consequence of measuring gene expression for circadian clock genes under different conditions; and for the synthetic biology dataset, as a consequence of changing the growth environment. I show that in addition to inferring sensible network structures, the model also successfully predicts the locations of iii changepoints. The third and final part of this thesis is concerned with parameter inference in ODE models of biological systems. This problem is of interest to systems biology researchers, as kinetic reaction parameters can often not be measured, or can only be estimated imprecisely from experimental data. Due to the cost of numerically solving the ODE system after each parameter adaptation, this is a computationally challenging problem. Gradient matching techniques circumvent this problem by directly fitting the derivatives of the ODE to the slope of an interpolant. I present an inference procedure for a model using nonparametric Bayesian statistics with Gaussian processes, based on Calderhead et al. (2008). I show that the new inference procedure improves on the original formulation in Calderhead et al. (2008) and I present the result of applying it to ODE models of predator-prey interactions, a circadian clock gene, a signal transduction pathway, and the JAK/STAT pathway. The material within this thesis is partly based on my published papers and book chapters: â€¢ Chapter 2, on reconstructing ecological networks, is based on Faisal et al. (2010). â€¢ Chapters 3 and 4, on reconstructing signalling pathways and gene regulatory networks with information sharing, are based on Dondelinger et al. (2010), Husmeier et al.

P199 Disparate Efficacy of Collagen Hydrolysate and Glucosamine on the Extracellular Matrix Metabolism of Articular Chondrocytes,"Purpose: Glucosamine has been used in the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) for several years. More recently, collagen fragments were shown to provide a positive effect on joint health. The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy of a specific type of collagen hydrolysate (CH) on the biosynthesis of ECM macromolecules in comparison with glucosamine sulfate (GS) and glucosamine hydrochloride (GH) in a chondrocyte culture model. Methods: Primary porcine articular chondrocytes and human femoral head chondrocytes were cultured under reduced oxygen conditions. The culture medium was supplemented with various concentrations of CH. In parallel experiments chondrocytes were treated with either GS or GH in various concentrations up to 2.5mM. At the end of the culture period the amount of cellassociated proteoglycans (PGs) and the extent of PG synthesis were quantified by measuring 35S-sulfate incorporation and by colorimetric assay. The amount of aggrecan accumulated in the ECM was determined by Western Blotting. In addition, type II collagen biosynthesis was quantified by means of ELISA technique. The results were confirmed by immunocytochemical detection of type II collagen and by analyzing the incorporation of 14C-proline into matrix proteins. Results: Supplementation of the culture medium with CH resulted in a statistically significant (p<0.05) increase of PG synthesis. The amount of cell-associated PGs was almost doubled after CH treatment, compared with the control cells. Administration of CH was also associated with increased aggrecan expression and a statistically significant (p<0.05) 1.5-fold increase of type II collagen biosynthesis. In contrast, the administration of GS or GH had no stimulatory effect on the type II collagen biosynthesis of the chondrocytes. Moreover, although slight differences could be observed between GS and GH, supplementation of glucosamine had no significant effect on the amount of cell-associated PGs, or total PG synthesis, compared to the controls. Conclusions: These results indicate a stimulatory effect of CH on the synthesis of PG and type II collagen. In contrast, GS and GH failed to stimulate the synthesis extracellular matrix (ECM) macromolecules by chondrocytes. These data suggest that CH may help reduce degenerative changes of the ECM by stimulating anabolic processes in cartilage tissue.",2006,Osteoarthritis and Cartilage

Spatial variation in larval growth and gut fullness in a coral reef fish,"Successful feeding and fast growth is thought to be critical for surviving the pelagic lar- val stage of benthic marine fishes, yet few measures of these processes are available for tropical reef fishes. We tested the hypothesis that larvae experience faster growth in more productive coastal waters due to increased prey availability. We examined spatial patterns in larval growth and gut full- ness for a common coral reef fish, the bluehead wrasse Thalassoma bifasciatum. During 2 ichthyo- plankton cruises (September 2003 and October 2004), larvae were collected using a coupled MOC- NESS at 17 stations along an 80 km east-west transect (25.5Â° N) across the Straits of Florida between Florida, USA, and the Bahamas. For a subsample of larvae collected at different distances along the transect, we examined sagittal otoliths to estimate growth rates and we inspected gut contents and estimated gut fullness for the same individuals. We also identified and enumerated the available prey of T. bifasciatum from a subsample of zooplankton samples collected simultaneously with the larvae. Larval T. bifasciatum collected at the western stations grew significantly faster, were larger-at-age, and had fuller guts than those collected at the central and eastern stations. Further, gut fullness of lar- vae was directly related to cross-straits prey abundance. Despite these repeatable patterns of growth and gut fullness, larval T. bifasciatum were consistently more abundant at the central and eastern stations, possibly reflecting particular transport processes or differential predation mortality. These results begin to bridge the gaps in our understanding of pelagic processes and the successful recruit- ment of nearshore populations.",2009,Marine Ecology Progress Series
Interventricular dyssynchrony due to unilateral atrioventricular conduction block in a patient with right atrial isomerism and twin atrioventricular nodes.,"gradually increasing the number of medications and doses. Oral amiodarone was administered for atrial arrhythmia. Subsequently, her cardiothoracic ratio improved from 70% to 65%. We performed cardiac catheterization and an electrophysiology study (EPS) to evaluate hemodynamics and arrhythmogenic substrates before surgical treatment. In cardiac catheterization, right ventricular (RV) end-diastolic volume index improved, from 255 to 128 ml/m 2 after optimal medical treatment. EPS 1 An EPS was performed with the patient under general anesthesia. For this intervention, a 4-mm-tip 7-F quadripolar catheter (Navistar, Biosense-Webster, Diamond Bar, California) was used for mapping and ablation. A steerable multipolar circular mapping catheter (Lasso, BiosenseWebster) was placed at the junction between the left superior caval veins and the left side of the atrium to serve as a reference for mapping. First, we mapped the area around the common AV ring to determine the location of the AV node during continuous atrial pacing. Two separate His bundle electrograms were recorded at the dorsal and inferior portions of the common AV ring (Figure 1). We detected an anterior AV node based on recording at the dorsal site of the AV ring, while a posterior AV node was recorded at the inferior site of the AV ring. During atrial pacing, 2 different QRS complexes were observed dependent on the pacing rate (Figure 2A). These QRS complexes did not show preexcitation, but QRS duration was prolonged dependent on the pacing rate. Figure 2A indicates 3 types of QRS complexes: (a) was recorded at rest and with lead I positive; (b) was recorded during atrial pacing, which was relatively rapid as compared with that at rest; and (c) was recorded during transient mechanical conduction block of the anterior AV node via catheter manipulation. Thus, QRS complexes at rest represented a fusion beat between the anterior and posterior AV nodes. No ventriculoatrial conduction was seen during ventricular pacing, even with isoproterenol infusion. Next, we initiated AT using atrial burst stimulation. The QRS complexes during AT (atrial tachycardia) (AT cycle length 450",2011,Heart rhythm
Efficient parallel linear scaling construction of the density matrix for Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics.,"We present an algorithm for the calculation of the density matrix that for insulators scales linearly with system size and parallelizes efficiently on multicore, shared memory platforms with small and controllable numerical errors. The algorithm is based on an implementation of the second-order spectral projection (SP2) algorithm [ Niklasson, A. M. N. Phys. Rev. B 2002 , 66 , 155115 ] in sparse matrix algebra with the ELLPACK-R data format. We illustrate the performance of the algorithm within self-consistent tight binding theory by total energy calculations of gas phase poly(ethylene) molecules and periodic liquid water systems containing up to 15,000 atoms on up to 16 CPU cores. We consider algorithm-specific performance aspects, such as local vs nonlocal memory access and the degree of matrix sparsity. Comparisons to sparse matrix algebra implementations using off-the-shelf libraries on multicore CPUs, graphics processing units (GPUs), and the Intel many integrated core (MIC) architecture are also presented. The accuracy and stability of the algorithm are illustrated with long duration Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics simulations of 1000 water molecules and a 303 atom Trp cage protein solvated by 2682 water molecules.",2015,Journal of chemical theory and computation
"Habitual sleep quality, plasma metabolites and risk of coronary heart disease in post-menopausal women.","Background
Epidemiologic studies suggest a strong link between poor habitual sleep quality and increased cardiovascular disease risk. However, the underlying mechanisms are not entirely clear. Metabolomic profiling may elucidate systemic differences associated with sleep quality that influence cardiometabolic health.


Methods
We explored cross-sectional associations between sleep quality and plasma metabolites in a nested case-control study of coronary heart disease (CHD) in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI; nâ€‰=â€‰1956) and attempted to replicate the results in an independent sample from the Nurses' Health Study II (NHSII; nâ€‰=â€‰209). A sleep-quality score (SQS) was derived from self-reported sleep problems asked in both populations. Plasma metabolomics were assayed using LC-MS with 347 known metabolites. General linear regression was used to identify individual metabolites associated with continuous SQS (false-discovery rate <0.05). Using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithms, a metabolite score was created from replicated metabolites and evaluated with CHD risk in the WHI.


Results
After adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, body mass index (BMI) and smoking, we identified 69 metabolites associated with SQS in the WHI (59 were lipids). Of these, 16 were replicated in NHSII (15 were lipids), including 6 triglycerides (TAGs), 4 phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs), 3 phosphatidylcholines (PCs), 1 diglyceride (DAG), 1 lysophosphatidylcholine and N6-acetyl-L-lysine (a product of histone acetylation). These metabolites were consistently higher among women with poorer sleep quality. The LASSO selection resulted in a nine-metabolite score (TAGs 45: 1, 48: 1, 50: 4; DAG 32: 1; PEs 36: 4, 38: 5; PCs 30: 1, 40: 6; N6-acetyl-L-lysine), which was positively associated with CHD risk (odds ratio per SD increase in the score: 1.16; 95% confidence interval: 1.05, 1.28; pâ€‰=â€‰0.0003) in the WHI after adjustment for matching factors and conventional CHD risk factors.


Conclusions
Differences in lipid metabolites may be an important pathogenic pathway linking poor habitual sleep quality and CHD risk.",2018,International journal of epidemiology

A radiomics approach to predict lymph node metastasis and clinical outcome of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma,"ObjectivesThis study was conducted in order to establish and validate a radiomics model for predicting lymph node (LN) metastasis of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IHC) and to determine its prognostic value.MethodsFor this retrospective study, a radiomics model was developed in a primary cohort of 103 IHC patients who underwent curative-intent resection and lymphadenectomy. Radiomics features were extracted from arterial phase computed tomography (CT) scans. A radiomics signature was built based on highly reproducible features using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was adopted to establish a radiomics model incorporating radiomics signature and other independent predictors. Model performance was determined by its discrimination, calibration, and clinical usefulness. The model was internally validated in 52 consecutive patients.ResultsThe radiomics signature comprised eight LN-statusâ€“related features and showed significant association with LN metastasis in both cohorts (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). A radiomics nomogram that incorporates radiomics signature and CA 19-9 level showed good calibration and discrimination in the primary cohort (AUC 0.8462) and validation cohort (AUC 0.8921). Promisingly, the radiomics nomogram yielded an AUC of 0.9224 in the CT-reported LN-negative subgroup. Decision curve analysis confirmed the clinical utility of this nomogram. High risk for metastasis portended significantly lower overall and recurrence-free survival than low risk for metastasis (both pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). The radiomics nomogram was an independent preoperative predictor of overall and recurrence-free survival.ConclusionsOur radiomics model provided a robust diagnostic tool for prediction of LN metastasis, especially in CT-reported LN-negative IHC patients, that may facilitate clinical decision-making.Key Pointsâ€¢ The radiomics nomogram showed good performance for prediction of LN metastasis in IHC patients, particularly in the CT-reported LN-negative subgroup.â€¢ Prognosis of high-risk patients remains dismal after curative-intent resection.â€¢ The radiomics model may facilitate clinical decision-making and define patient subsets benefiting most from surgery.",2019,European Radiology

Web Ontology Language (OWL) is one of the knowledge representation language for creating, manipulating and processing ontologies and is a W3C recommendation since May, 2004. This report is a study of the OWL API a java based API for semantic web ontologies. The WonderWeb group [6] produced the initial implementations of the API and the current development is supported by the CO-ODE group [7] which also provides the ProtÃ©gÃ© tool development. History: The history of OWL can be traced back to two independent works DAMLONT and OIL. OIL was a frame-based language developed by group of European researchers with RDFS based syntax and semantics described in terms of Descriptive Logics. DAML-ONT was developed largely by US based researchers which extended RDFS with constructs from object-oriented language and frame-based languages. The problems with DAML-ONT included problems with both human and machine interpretation. DAML+OIL language came into being with the merging of OIL and DAML-ONT which had a RDFS syntax based on Descriptive Logic. DAML+OIL was submitted to W3C for standardization which led to the Web Ontology Language (OWL). Ontology in Computer Science: An ontology is defined as an engineering artifact constituted by a specific vocabulary used to describe a certain reality and a set of explicit assumptions regarding the intended meaning of the vocabulary. Thus an ontology describes a formal specification of a certain domain that allows for shared understanding of a domain of interest and formal and machine manipulable model of a domain of interest. Ontology represents knowledge in terms of concepts defined by classes, properties and individuals and a set of axioms that assert how those concepts are to be interpreted. The building of a semantic web requires following : i) Annotation â€“ Associating metadata with resources ii) Integration â€“ Integrating information sources iii) Inference â€“ Reasoning over the information we have iv) Infrastructure Could be lightweight or Could be heavy-weight v) Interoperation and Sharing are key goals Semantics and Languages: Semantic Web is based on frame based modeling approaches that describes concepts in terms of classes, slots, fillers. The language constructs is derived from RDF, RDF(S) and includes logical foundation through which well-formed inference can be derived. The increased formality makes languages more amenable to machine processing. The formal semantics provides an unambiguous interpretation of the descriptions and well defined semantics are vital to support machine interpretability and to remove ambiguities in the interpretation of the descriptions. The work on Semantic Web has concentrated on the definition of a collection or â€œstackâ€ of languages namely XML, RDF, RDF(S), OWL. These languages provide basic machinery that we can use to represent the extra semantic information needed for the Semantic Web. OWL API Philosophy and Abstract Syntax: There are three variations of OWL existing currently: OWL Full, OWL DL and OWL Lite . The OWL API is targeted primarily at representing OWL-DL. An Ontology is represented as a collection of axioms that assert information about the classes, properties and individuals that are in the ontology. The API is build with the philosophy that a higher level data model can help to insulate us from the vagaries of concrete syntax, make it clear what is happening in terms of functionality, increase the likelyhood of interoperating applications and make it easy to write code spotting â€œinternal errorsâ€. The OWL abstract syntax provides a definition of the language in terms of the constructs and assertions allowed. Semantics are then defined in terms of this abstract syntax. OWL API data model is based largely on this abstract syntax presentation. OWL API Implementation: The OWL API implementation includes the following functionalities on an ontology: i) Modeling â€“ A set of data structures to represent OWL ontologies/documents ii) Parsing Taking some syntactic presentation, e.g. OWL-RDF and converting it to some (useful) internal data structure iii) Serializing Producing a syntactic presentation, e.g. OWL-XML from a local data structure iv) Manipulation/Change Being able to manipulate the underlying objects v) Inference Providing a representation that implements/understands the formal semantics of the language. The API provides classes to create, manipulate, parse, render and reason about those structures. The model data structures provide representations of the basic building blocks.The basic data structure represents the objects in the ontology and corresponds roughly to the abstract syntax of OWL. OWL Classes: OWL allows to describe a domain in terms of individuals, classes and properties and a collection of axioms describing how these classes, individuals, properties etc. should be interpreted. Some of the important classes in the API are :i) OWLOntology An OWLOntology represents an ontology and consists of a collection of OWLAxioms. The OWLOntology provides an explicit context within which we can assert information about classes and properties ii) OWLEntity OWLEntity is the fundamental building block of the ontology classes, properties, individuals and datatypes. iii) OWLClass â€“ OWLClass represents an OWL Class. The class itself is a lightweight object and axioms relating to the class are held by an OWOntology object iv) OWLProperty â€“ OWLProperty is the base class for OWLObjectProperty and OWLDataProperty. Properties can have associated domains and ranges. v) OWLObjectProperty Represents an Object Property that can be used to relate two individuals. vi) OWLDataProperty Represents an Object Property that can be used to relate an individual to a value. vii) OWLAxiom â€“ OWL Axiom class contains a collection of OWLAxioms namely Annotation Axioms, Declaration Axioms, Import Axioms, Logical Axioms The API also provides a collection of interfaces for inference services over the ontology model:i) OWLClassReasoner â€“ Checks for class satisfiability ii) OWLConsistencyChecker â€“ Checks for Ontology consistency iii) OWLIndividualReasoner Reasoning about individuals iv) OWLPropertyReasoner Reasoning about properties The Reasoner implementation is not a part of the OWL API but the API can make use of the following reasoner implemenatations:i) Pellet , Hermit â€“ Pure Java implementation and implements OWL API reasoner interfaces ii) FaCT++ C++ Implementation that acts as OWL API wrapper implementing OWL API interfaces. iii) Debuggers â€“ Reside on top of reasoner Ontology Management: The Management and creation of ontologies is controlled by an OWLOntologyManager class object. This replaces OWLConnection/OWLManager in the original OWL 1.1 implementation. The Manager is responsible for keeping track of the ontologies and concrete formats for storage of the ontologies. Pseudo-Code Examples: 1) The following code snippet shows loading of an ontology using a logical URI by creating a mapping of logical URI and physical URI ://create OntologyManager object for working with ontologies OWLOntologyManager manager = OWLManager.createOWLOntologyManager(); //Logical URI IRI ontologyIRI = IRI.create(""http://www.test.com/ontologies/testont.owl""); //Physical URI IRI documentIRI = IRI.create(""file:/C:/Users/Syed/Desktop/animal.owl""); //Create a mapping for logical and physical URI using SimpleIRIMapper class object SimpleIRIMapper mapper = new SimpleIRIMapper(ontologyIRI, documentIRI); manager.addIRIMapper(mapper); 2) The following pseudo-code shows how to create a class in the ontology://Create a OWLDataFactory object that actually contains reference to all entities in an ontology namely classes, individuals, properties OWLDataFactory factory = manager.getOWLDataFactory(); //Create a class using the OWLDataFactory object OWLClass animal = factory.getOWLClass(IRI.create(ontologyIRI + ""#animal"")); Or use a PrefixManager class create a class PrefixManager pm = new DefaultPrefixManager(""://www.test.com/ontologies/testont.owl #""); OWLClass animal = factory.getOWLClass("":animal"", pm); 3) The following pseudo-code creates an axiom that specifies one class as the subclass of another://Create two classes OWLClass animal = factory.getOWLClass(IRI.create(ontologyIRI + ""#animal"")); OWLClass herbivore = factory.getOWLClass(IRI.create(ontologyIRI + ""#herbivore"")); //Create the subclass axiom OWLAxiom axiom1 = factory.getOWLSubClassOfAxiom(herbivore,animal); //Save the axiom in the ontology by using applyChange() method of OWLOntologyManager AddAxiom addAxiom1 = new AddAxiom(ontology, axiom1); manager.applyChange(addAxiom1); 4) The following pseudo-code shows an ObjectProperty axiom :PrefixManager pm = new DefaultPrefixManager(""http://www.test.com/ontologies/testont.owl""); //Create two individuals of the class OWLIndividual lion = dataFactory.getOWLNamedIndividual("":lion"", pm); OWLIndividual cow = dataFactory.getOWLNamedIndividual("":herbivore"", pm); //Create the object property eats OWLObjectProperty eats = dataFactory.getOWLObjectProperty(IRI.create(animal + ""#eats"")); //Create the ObjectPropertyAssertionAxiom OWLObjectPropertyAssertionAxiom axiom1 = dataFactory.getOWLObjectPropertyAssertionAxiom(eats, lion, cow); manager.addAxiom(animal,axiom1); 5) The following pseudo-code shows how to create DataTypeProperty axiom ://Create a typed datatype object(of type integer) OWLDatatype integer = dataFactory.getIntegerOWLDatatype(); //Create an untyped datatype OWLLiteral hundred = dataFactory.getOWLLiteral(100); //Create a MIN_INCLUSIVE restriction on a ty",2011,
"Female choice of sites versus mates in a coral reef fish, Thalassoma bifasciatum","To understand the dynamics of sexual selection, one needs to identify the basis of female choice in mating. Daily censuses showed that most spawns of individual female bluehead wrasses, Thalassoma bifasciatum, occurred at one of several available mating sites, either in a group-spawning aggregation of small males or with a large territorial male. Most females were not located near their principal mating site during the non-spawning period of the day. Females were thus exposed to other males and sites and should have had the opportunity for choice. When a resident territorial male disappeared or was removed experimentally from a mating site, females did not alter their fidelity to that site. Furthermore, manipulations showed that when a territorial male changed the location of his mating activity to an adjacent site, females did not follow him but continued to mate at their customary site. Thus mating sites, rather than the males occupying them, appeared to be the objects of female choice. The bright coloration and courtship behaviour of larger males may demonstrate the safety of a particular site rather than indicating some aspect of male quality.",1987,Animal Behaviour

Flexibility of Bayesian LASSO under different genetic structure,"To evaluate the flexibility of the Bayesian LASSO six scenarios were simulated considering a trait controlled by 145 or 725 quantitative trait loci (QTL), where the QTL effects were sampled from three distributions: Normal, Gamma and Uniform. The population size was 4,500 animals and each of genetic structures were simulated 30 times. The posterior mean for additive genetic variance and heritability were close to the real value. Correlations between estimated and true genomic breeding values (GBV) were high and close in all simulated scenarios, indicating that the structure of the trait does not affect the predictive ability of the model. The Bayesian LASSO showed similar performance in terms of genetic parameters estimation and genomic breeding values predictions in spite of the underlying assumptions of genetic structure.",2014,
THE DISTINCTIVE FEATURES AND THE MAIN GOALS OF ATHENIAN IMPERIALISM IN THE 5 th CENTURY BC ( Ê»IMPERIAL â€™ POLICIES AND MEANS OF CONTROL IN THE MID 5,"The main priority of my paper will be to point out characteristic features and the most important objectives of Athenian â€œimperialismâ€ during the last two decades of the period called Pentekontaetia (the period of fifty years â€’ 479â€’431 BC.). I will try to characterize terms â€œimperialismâ€ and â€œempireâ€ in context of their application to the 5th century Athens in modern historiography, which I suggest is quite problematic and doesnâ€™t precisely define the true image of Athenian á¼€ÏÏ‡Î® (arche â€’ empire, realm, magistracy, office etc.).2 My other objective will be to describe how frequently and to what extent the Athenians used various kinds of policies and means of control in attempt to transform the first Athenian naval League, also known as the Delian ÏƒÏ…Î¼Î¼Î±Ï‡Î¯Î± (symmachia â€’ alliance, offensive and defensive), into their own thalassocratic empire and allies into their subjects. Finally, I will also focus my attention on how the lust for power and hegemony affected Athenian foreign policy and Athenian relationship with other Greeks, either allies or not, living in the Aegean and the eastern part of Mediterranean.",2013,
Efficient Feature Screening for Lasso-Type Problems via Hybrid Safe-Strong Rules,"The lasso model has been widely used for model selection in data mining, machine learning, and high-dimensional statistical analysis. However, due to the ultrahigh-dimensional, large-scale data sets collected in many real-world applications, it remains challenging to solve the lasso problems even with state-of-the-art algorithms. Feature screening is a powerful technique for addressing the Big Data challenge by discarding inactive features from the lasso optimization. In this paper, we propose a family of hybrid safe-strong rules (HSSR) which incorporate safe screening rules into the sequential strong rule (SSR) to remove unnecessary computational burden. In particular, we present two instances of HSSR, namely SSR-Dome and SSR-BEDPP, for the standard lasso problem. We further extend SSR-BEDPP to the elastic net and group lasso problems to demonstrate the generalizability of the hybrid screening idea. Extensive numerical experiments with synthetic and real data sets are conducted for both the standard lasso and the group lasso problems. Results show that our proposed hybrid rules substantially outperform existing state-of-the-art rules.",2017,arXiv: Machine Learning
$\chi^2$-confidence sets in high-dimensional regression,"Abstract We study a high-dimensional regression model. Aim is to construct a confidence set for a given group of regression coefficients, treating all other regression coefficients as nuisance parameters. We apply a one-step procedure with the square-root Lasso as initial estimator and a multivariate square-root Lasso for constructing a surrogate Fisher information matrix. The multivariate square-root Lasso is based on nuclear norm loss with l1-penalty. We show that this procedure leads to an asymptotically Ï‡2-distributed pivot, with a remainder term depending only on the l1-error of the initial estimator. We show that under l1-sparsity conditions on the regression coefficients Î² 0 the square-root Lasso produces to a consistent estimator of the noise variance and we establish sharp oracle inequalities which show that the remainder term is small under further sparsity conditions on Î²0 and compatibility conditions on the design.",2015,
Sliced Inverse Regression With Adaptive Spectral Sparsity for Dimension Reduction.,"Dimension reduction is an important topic in pattern analysis and machine learning, and it has wide applications in feature representation and pattern classification. In the past two decades, sliced inverse regression (SIR) has attracted much research efforts due to its effectiveness and efficacy in dimension reduction. However, two drawbacks limit further applications of SIR. First, the computation complexity of SIR is usually high in the situation of high-dimensional data. Second, sparsity of projection subspace is not well mined for improving the feature selection and model interpretation abilities. This paper proposes to compute the SIR projection vectors in the spectral space, then an approximated regression solution can be obtained with a faster speed. Moreover, the adaptive lasso is used to attain a sparse and globally optimal solution, which is important in variable selection. To complete the robust pattern classification task with corruptions, a correntropy-based and class-wise regression model is designed in this paper. It takes a smooth penalty instead of sparsity constraint in the regression coefficients, and it can be conducted in class-wise, thus it is more flexible in practice. Extensive experiments are conducted by using some real and benchmark data sets, e.g., high-dimensional facial images and gene microarray data, to evaluate the new algorithms. The new proposals attain competitive results and are compared with other state-of-the-art methods.",2017,IEEE transactions on cybernetics
Identification of race-associated metabolite biomarkers for hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with liver cirrhosis and hepatitis C virus infection,"Disparities in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) incidence and survival have been observed between ethnic groups including African-Americans (AA) and European-Americans (EA). The evaluation of the changes in the levels of metabolites in samples stratified by race could provide a snapshot of ethnically diverse disease related pathways and identify reliable biomarkers. In this study, we considered AA and EA to investigate metabolites that may be associated with HCC in a race-specific manner. The levels of 46 metabolites in plasma samples, collected from patients recruited at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, were analyzed by Agilent GC-qMS in selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode. A least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model was applied to select metabolites with significant changes in HCC vs. cirrhosis in three groups: (1) AA and EA combined; (2) AA separately; and (3) EA separately. In addition, metabolites that distinguish HCC cases from cirrhosis in these three groups were selected by excluding those without HCV infection. The performances of the metabolites selected by LASSO in each group were evaluated through a leave-one-out cross-validation. We identified race-specific metabolites that differentiated HCC cases from cirrhotic controls, yielding better area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve (AUC) compared to alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), the serological marker widely used for the diagnosis of HCC. This study sheds light on metabolites that could potentially be used as biomarkers for HCC by monitoring their levels in high-risk population of cirrhotic patients in a race-specific manner.",2018,PLoS ONE
Use of a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) model to selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS) analysis of exhaled breath to predict the efficacy of dialysis: a pilot study.,"Selected ion flow tube-mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS) provides rapid, non-invasive measurements of a full-mass scan of volatile compounds in exhaled breath. Although various studies have suggested that breath metabolites may be indicators of human disease status, many of these studies have included few breath samples and large numbers of compounds, limiting their power to detect significant metabolites. This study employed a least absolute shrinkage and selective operator (LASSO) approach to SIFT-MS data of breath samples to preliminarily evaluate the ability of exhaled breath findings to monitor the efficacy of dialysis in hemodialysis patients. A process of model building and validation showed that blood creatinine and urea concentrations could be accurately predicted by LASSO-selected masses. Using various precursors, the LASSO models were able to predict creatinine and urea concentrations with high adjusted R-square (>80%) values. The correlation between actual concentrations and concentrations predicted by the LASSO model (using precursor H3O+) was high (Pearson correlation coefficientâ€‰â€‰=â€‰â€‰0.96). Moreover, use of full mass scan data provided a better prediction than compounds from selected ion mode. These findings warrant further investigations in larger patient cohorts. By employing a more powerful statistical approach to predict disease outcomes, breath analysis using SIFT-MS technology could be applicable in future to daily medical diagnoses.",2016,Journal of breath research

Approximate Newton-based statistical inference using only stochastic gradients,"We present a novel inference framework for convex empirical risk minimization, using approximate stochastic Newton steps. The proposed algorithm is based on the notion of finite differences and allows the approximation of a Hessian-vector product from first-order information. In theory, our method efficiently computes the statistical error covariance in $M$-estimation, both for unregularized convex learning problems and high-dimensional LASSO regression, without using exact second order information, or resampling the entire data set. In practice, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on large-scale machine learning problems, that go even beyond convexity: as a highlight, our work can be used to detect certain adversarial attacks on neural networks.",2018,ArXiv
The Masses of William Byrd,"The Ordinary of the Mass was a principal genre in the Renaissance, and most Renaissance composers gave it considerable attention. The masses of William Byrd are among the most distinguished of the genre. The first polyphonic mass I ever sang was William Byrd's Mass for Five Voices. The first polyphonic mass I ever sang with the St. Ann Choir--which I now direct--was Byrd's Mass for Three Voices. This choir has sung the Mass for Four Voices at least twice a year for the last thirty-five years and the others occasionally. Having sung the Four-Voice Mass most frequently, I have always been surprised when singing one of the others to notice the close resemblances; I have often thought, ""Why, this is the same mass with different notes."" While this may be a slight exaggeration, it points to the unique position of the masses among Byrd's works in striking contrast with the works of the other prominent Renaissance composers. While Palestrina wrote over a hundred, Lasso nearly eighty, Victoria nearly twenty, and Josquin at least fifteen, Byrd wrote only three: simply one for each number of voices, three, four, and five. Why? Why not the amazing variety of the continental composers? What difference does it make? What sense does the difference make? The Renaissance Mass Ordinary is a paradoxical genre; it is comprised of diverse texts bound by a single musical style. This was not the case in the Middle Ages. At that time, each piece of the ordinary was a separate liturgical genre: litanies--Kyrie and Agnus Dei, hymns--Gloria and Sanctus, and profession of belief--Credo. And each of these genres had its own musical style. These movements, whose texts remained constant from service to service, were most likely to have been set to polyphonic music for practical reasons: the settings could be used on any day in contrast with the Propers of the Mass, which could be sung on only one or at most a few days of the year. Yet, there was little integration among the parts of the ordinary when they were set to polyphonic music. Even the mass of Guillaume de Machaut was probably compiled from separately existing movements; some of its movements were based upon chant melodies and some were not, and those that were used different chants for each movement. In the Renaissance, in contrast, there was a sense of artistic integration among those movements distinguished by polyphonic setting. The five movements of the ordinary were now composed as the pillars of the whole service, integrating and ordering the entire liturgy. They were in a consistent style from movement to movement, despite the diversity of their texts. Being all by a single composer, their consistent style created a kind of rondo-like musical structure in alternation with the other elements of the service, which were mostly chants in diverse styles and modes, written at varying times over the whole history. Since these mass compositions were numerous--Palestrina alone wrote 103--and were all on the same set of texts, there had to be a principle of differentiation. To imagine the difficulty for a composer setting about to write his hundredth mass upon the same texts, yet composing something original that had not been done in any of the previous settings, is to realize the necessity of a principle of differentiation between such numerous masses. How could each of these masses have a unique style and expression? The principle of differentiation was the use of borrowed material: each mass was based upon musical material--chants or polyphonic pieces, sacred or secular--that had its source outside the mass itself, ensuring that the mass based upon it sounded fundamentally different from others based upon other borrowed materials. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] There were striking differences in this use of borrowed materials between the fifteenth and the sixteenth centuries, what they borrowed and why they borrowed it. These differences relate to a difference between the aesthetics of the two centuries, a difference of the attitude to affect, or the emotion expressed by the music. â€¦",2009,Sacred Music
Geometric ergodicity of the Bayesian lasso,"Consider the standard linear model y = X +âœ , where the components of âœ are iid standard normal errors. Park and Casella [14] consider a Bayesian treatment of this model with a Laplace/Inverse-Gamma prior on (,). They introduce a Data Augmentation approach that can be used to explore the resulting intractable posterior density, and call it the Bayesian lasso algorithm. In this paper, the Markov chain underlying the Bayesian lasso algorithm is shown to be geometrically ergodic, for arbitrary values of the sample size n and the number of variables p. This is important, as geometric ergodicity provides theoretical justification for the use of Markov chain CLT, which can then be used to obtain asymptotic standard errors for Markov chain based estimates of posterior quantities. Kyung et al [12] provide a proof of geometric ergodicity for the restricted case n p, but as we explain in this paper, their proof is incorrect. Our approach is different and more direct, and enables us to establish geometric ergodicity for arbitrary n and p.",2013,Electronic Journal of Statistics

Gather and Conquer: Region-Based Strategies to Accelerate Safe Screening Tests,"In this paper, we propose new methodologies to decrease the computational cost of safe screening tests for LASSO. We first introduce a new screening strategy, dubbed â€œjoint screening test,â€ which allows the rejection of a set of atoms by performing one single test. Our approach enables to find good compromises between complexity of implementation and effectiveness of screening. Second, we propose two new methods to decrease the computational cost inherent to the construction of the (so-called) â€œsafe region.â€ Our numerical experiments show that the proposed procedures lead to significant computational gains as compared to standard methodologies.",2019,IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing
Generalized information criterion for model selection in penalized graphical models,"This paper introduces an estimator of the relative directed distance between an estimated model and the true model, based on the Kulback-Leibler divergence and is motivated by the generalized information criterion proposed by Konishi and Kitagawa. This estimator can be used to select model in penalized Gaussian copula graphical models. The use of this estimator is not feasible for high-dimensional cases. However, we derive an efficient way to compute this estimator which is feasible for the latter class of problems. Moreover, this estimator is, generally, appropriate for several penalties such as lasso, adaptive lasso and smoothly clipped absolute deviation penalty. Simulations show that the method performs similarly to KL oracle estimator and it also improves BIC performance in terms of support recovery of the graph. Specifically, we compare our method with Akaike information criterion, Bayesian information criterion and cross validation for band, sparse and dense network structures.",2014,arXiv: Methodology
Wearable sensor based multimodal human activity recognition exploiting the diversity of classifier ensemble,"Effectively utilizing multimodal information (e.g., heart rate and acceleration) is a promising way to achieve wearable sensor based human activity recognition (HAR). In this paper, an activity recognition approach MARCEL (<u>M</u>ultimodal <u>A</u>ctivity <u>R</u>ecognition with <u>C</u>lassifier <u>E</u>nsemble) is proposed, which exploits the diversity of base classifiers to construct a good ensemble for multimodal HAR, and the diversity measure is obtained from both labeled and unlabeled data. MARCEL uses neural network (NN) as base classifiers to construct the HAR model, and the diversity of classifier ensemble is embedded in the error function of the model. In each iteration, the error of the model is decomposed and back-propagated to base classifiers. To ensure the overall accuracy of the model, the weights of base classifiers are learnt in the classifier fusion process with sparse group lasso. Extensive experiments show that MARCEL is able to yield a competitive HAR performance, and has its superiority on exploiting multimodal signals.",2016,Proceedings of the 2016 ACM International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing

Arthroskopische Refixation proximaler Ausrisse des vorderen Kreuzbands,"ZusammenfassungDie arthroskopisch gestÃ¼tzte Refixation einer akuten proximalen Ruptur des vorderen Kreuzbands (VKB) hat das Ziel, die anatomische und biomechanische IntegritÃ¤t des VKB wiederherzustellen. Banderhaltende Verfahren haben in den letzten Jahren wieder neuen Aufwind bekommen. Neben der Weiterentwicklung von Naht- bzw. Refixationsmaterialien und der operativen Technik hat sich aber auch die Indikationsstellung als entscheidender Faktor fÃ¼r das postoperative Ergebnis herausgestellt. Indikationen stellen akute, proximale VKB-Rupturen mit intakter Ligamentsubstanz dar. Entsprechend kann die abschlieÃŸende Entscheidung zur Ankerrefixation erst intraoperativ erfolgen. Hierbei wird unter arthroskopischer Sicht die intakte Ligamentstruktur mittels Fiberwire-FÃ¤den armiert und an der femoralen Insertion des VKB mit einem knotenlosen Anker refixiert. AnschlieÃŸend kann additiv eine Mikrofrakturierung erfolgen. Erste Studien zeigen gute klinische Ergebnisse; die Versagensrate liegt derzeit bei bis zu 15â€‰%.AbstractThe aim of arthroscopically assisted refixation combined with microfracturing of acute proximal anterior cruciate ligament ruptures (ACL) is to restore the anatomical and biomechanical properties of the native ACL. Due to several reasons ACL repair techniques have gained new interest. In addition to the newly developed suture materials, arthroscopic repair techniques and aÂ better patient selection, favored indications are acute proximal ACL tears with good tissue quality of the residual ligament. Therefore, the final decision on treatment is possible during intraoperative arthroscopic examination of the ACL with aÂ probe. After debridement of the femoral ACL insertion, aÂ curved lasso is used to place a suture through the ACL. AÂ drill guide is used to ensure positioning of the anchor in the center of the ACL insertion zone. Microfracturing holes around the femoral footprint are made with an awl to enhance healing properties of the ACL. Initial clinical studies have shown good results and the revision rate is currently approximately 15%.",2017,Arthroskopie

Innate Immune Mechanism of Platelet-Neutrophil Aggregation Dependent Vaso-occlusion in Sickle Cell Disease,"Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is an autosomal-recessiveâ€“genetic-disorder that affects 100,000 in the U.S. and millions worldwide. Sickle cell anemia, the most common form of SCD results from a single nucleotide polymorphism in the Î²-globin gene that causes the hemoglobin to polymerize under deoxygenated conditions. Hemoglobin polymerization leads to sickling of erythrocytes, exposure of adhesion molecules on the erythrocyte membrane, and hemolysis. Hemolysis releases erythrocyte derived danger-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs) that activate leukocytes, platelets and endothelium and enable interactions with sickle erythrocytes and promote vaso-occlusion (VOC). VOC is the predominant pathophysiology responsible for acute systemic vaso-occlusive crisis, the leading cause of emergency medical care among SCD patients. VOC is also believed to contribute to progression of other morbidities such as pulmonary hypertension, stroke, and acute chest syndrome, however, the cellular, molecular and biophysical mechanisms that enable VOC in SCD patients remain incompletely understood. 
To determine the mechanisms that promote VOC in SCD patients, we developed quantitative microfluidic fluorescence microscopy (qMFM), a novel fluorescence imaging approach that utilizes PDMS-based microfluidic devices to visualize single-cell interactions in SCD human blood. Using qMFM, neutrophils were observed to roll, arrest and capture freely flowing platelets leading to formation of large platelet-neutrophil aggregates that occluded microfluidic flow channels. Quantitative analysis revealed that platelet-neutrophil interactions in SCD patient blood were not only more numerous but also significantly longer in duration than those in control blood. These platelet-neutrophil interactions were enabled by platelet P-selectin and GPIbÎ± binding to neutrophil PSGL-1 and Mac-1, respectively and were abolished following blockade of these interactions. qMFM revealed for the first time that platelets in SCD blood form P-selectin expressing â€œhair-likeâ€ membrane tethers that promote platelet-neutrophil interactions by shielding the bonds from the hydrodynamic shear forces of blood. Hair-like tethers act like a â€˜lassoâ€™ that allows circulating platelets to interact more efficiently with neutrophils within the vasculature. Inhibition of platelet TLR4 or NLRP3 inflammasome dependent signaling abolished â€œhair-likeâ€ platelet tethers and attenuated platelet-neutrophil aggregation in SCD human blood. This study highlights the potential of therapeutic inhibition of platelet P-selectin or NLRP3 inflammasome pathway in preventing VOC in SCD patients.",2018,

Hellenic Integrative Psychotherapy: A Total Holistic Approach,"An integrative psychotherapy model is described which proposes that the basic â€œschoolsâ€ of psychotherapy, that is the psychodynamic, behavioral, humanistic/existential, systemic and biological approaches can be synthesized into a new improved paradigm. This total holistic approach is not in conflict with any of the contributing models which are perceived as complementary to each other. Moreover, there is ample scientific evidence that all traditional psychotherapies share the same common therapeutic factors. Hellenic integrative psychotherapy comprises a new idealistic approach which has different improved properties in the same way that Water differs from its constituents Oxygen and Hydrogen. Elements of ancient Greek philosophy, mythology, history, literature, ethics, values, reasoning, mentality and way of life are considered to be an important constituent of Hellenic Integrative Psychotherapy. Hippocratic diet, Bodily exercises that enhance physical wellness and brain function, Therapeutic thermal and cold baths, Thalassotherapy, Exposure to sunlight, Music therapy, Theater therapy, Art therapy, Therapeutic architecture and the exposure to a Therapeutically beautiful physical environment constitute important integral elements of the presented total holistic approach. Last but not least, Neurofeedback (training of the EEG) and Event Related Potentials (ERPs) will be employed.",2018,Psychology
LASSO: an intelligent computer-based tutorial in sixteenth-century counterpoint,"The LASSO tutorial in sixteenth-century counterpoint is a software system intended to provide an efficient learning environment. The project was undertaken in order to answer the need for new means of building skills in the compositional discipline of counterpoint (Newcomb 1983). There is no substitute for training that requires neophyte composers to deal with the problem of multiple voices according to rules that (1) ensure an agreeable motion and form within each voice, (2) maintain a balance of importance among all the voices, (3) keep all voices in independent motion, and (4) set the voices free from slavish dependency on prearranged chord changes. It is emphatically not the purpose of the LASSO system to imbue undergraduates with an appreciation for systematic musicology, or to turn students into composers of irrelevant sixteenth-century music. The purpose is not even necessarily to give them an absolutely accurate account of sixteenthcentury style, although the rules are intended to do that as much as is consistent with the overriding objective of simplicity and consistency of the judging criteria. The proper purpose of sixteenthcentury counterpoint instruction in the twentieth century is to acquaint young composers with one kind of intellectual exercise that Western composers have found valuable for centuries. The best way of providing this kind of training is still through the use of some version of the venerable ""species"" counterpoint method first introduced in the early eighteenth century (Fux 1725). Like Fux's Gradus ad Parnassum, LASSO is a latter-day attempt to make instructional sense of the style by codifying its elements in a fashion that a scholarly composer or musicologist might feel amounts to an oversimplification, or even a misrepresentation. Several problems are commonly encountered by music teachers who provide species counterpoint instruction. LASSO is intended to answer or at least ameliorate the issues discussed in the following paragraphs. First, few professional composers (or musicologists, for that matter) can agree on a particular species counterpoint text, and they generally end up choosing a text they consider the best of a bad lot. It is quite difficult to write a textbook on species counterpoint; problems result from the conflict between the intended purpose of counterpoint instruction (to develop compositional skill) and the normal academic procedure used when teaching any historical subject (examination of original sources, such as the works of Palestrina, Victoria, Lassus, et al.). Some scholarly texts tend to be long on historical examples and short on simple advice for students (e.g., Jeppeson 1939); others, presumably in the interest of conciseness and clarity, fail to account for all the possibilities (e.g., Krenek 1959). The Schoenberg text (1963), while having the virtue of communicating the general features of the style by means of hierarchies of stylistic acceptability, can be a nightmare for a student trying to make a list of rules by which he can pass a course. While in many respects the Soderlund (1947) text appears the most useful for classroom purposes, students sometimes find even it confusing and self-contradictory, due to the fact that some of the general considerations outlined in the introductory section do not apply to certain species that are introduced later. Regardless of which text is being used, for each homework assignment the instructor must explain to the class what will be accepted and what will be rejected in student exercises despite (or in addition to) what is written in the text; to fail to do so is to Computer Music Journal, Vol. 9, No. 4, Winter 1985, C 1985 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",1985,Computer Music Journal
"High-dimensional regression in practice: an empirical study of finite-sample prediction, variable selection and ranking","Penalized likelihood approaches are widely used for high-dimensional regression. Although many methods have been proposed and the associated theory is now well developed, the relative efficacy of different approaches in finite-sample settings, as encountered in practice, remains incompletely understood. There is therefore a need for empirical investigations in this area that can offer practical insight and guidance to users. In this paper, we present a large-scale comparison of penalized regression methods. We distinguish between three related goals: prediction, variable selection and variable ranking. Our results span more than 2300 data-generating scenarios, including both synthetic and semisynthetic data (real covariates and simulated responses), allowing us to systematically consider the influence of various factors (sample size, dimensionality, sparsity, signal strength and multicollinearity). We consider several widely used approaches (Lasso, Adaptive Lasso, Elastic Net, Ridge Regression, SCAD, the Dantzig Selector and Stability Selection). We find considerable variation in performance between methods. Our results support a ""no panacea"" view, with no unambiguous winner across all scenarios or goals, even in this restricted setting where all data align well with the assumptions underlying the methods. The study allows us to make some recommendations as to which approaches may be most (or least) suitable given the goal and some data characteristics. Our empirical results complement existing theory and provide a resource to compare methods across a range of scenarios and metrics.",2020,Statistics and Computing
Innovation-based sparse estimation of functional connectivity from multivariate autoregressive models,"One of the main limitations of functional connectivity estimators of brain networks is that they can suffer from statistical reliability when the number of areas is large and the available time series are short. To estimate directed functional connectivity with multivariate autoregressive (MVAR) model on sparse connectivity assumption, we propose a modified Group Lasso procedure with an adapted penalty. Our procedure includes the innovation estimates as explaining variables. This approach is inspired by two criteria that are used to interpret the coefficients of the MVAR model, the Directed Transfer Function (DTF) and the Partial Directed Coherence (PDC). A causality measure can be deduced from the output coefficients which can be understood as a synthesis of PDC and DTF. We demonstrate the potential of our method and compare our results with the standard Group Lasso on simulated data.",2015,
Lassoing the HAR Model: A Model Selection Perspective on Realized Volatility Dynamics,"Realized volatility computed from high-frequency data is an important measure for many applications in finance, and its dynamics have been widely investigated. Recent notable advances that perform well include the heterogeneous autoregressive (HAR) model which can approximate long memory, is very parsimonious, is easy to estimate, and features good out-of-sample performance. We prove that the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) recovers the lags structure of the HAR model asymptotically if it is the true model, and we present Monte Carlo evidence in finite samples. The HAR model's lags structure is not fully in agreement with the one found using the Lasso on real data. Moreover, we provide empirical evidence that there are two clear breaks in structure for most of the assets we consider. These results bring into question the appropriateness of the HAR model for realized volatility. Finally, in an out-of-sample analysis, we show equal performance of the HAR model and the Lasso approach.",2016,Econometric Reviews
Nomogram for predicting overall survival in stage IIâ€III colorectal cancer,"PURPOSE
The overall survival (OS) of patients diagnosed with stage II-III colorectal cancer (CRC) can vary greatly, even between patients with the same tumor stage. We aimed to design a nomogram to predict OS in resected, stage II-III CRC and stratify patients with CRC into different risk groups.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
Based on data from 873 patients with CRC, we used univariate Cox regression analysis to select the significant prognostic features, which were subjected to the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression algorithm for feature selection. Cross-validation was used to confirm suitable tuning parameters (Î») for LASSO logistic regression. Then, the nomogram was used to estimate 3- and 5-year OS based on the multivariable Cox regression model. The survival curves of the two groups were produced using the Kaplan-Meier method. Risk group stratification was performed to assess the predictive capacity of the nomogram.


RESULTS
Preoperative mean platelet volume, preoperative platelet distribution width, monocytes, and postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy were identified as independent prognostic factors by LASSO regression and integrated for the construction of the nomogram. The nomogram provided good discrimination, with C-indices of 0.67 and 0.69 for the training and validation sets, respectively. Calibration plots illustrated excellent agreement between the nomogram predictions and actual observations for 3- and 5-year OS. Moreover, a significant difference in OS was shown between patients stratified into different risk groups (PÂ <Â .001).


CONCLUSION
We constructed and validated an original predictive nomogram for OS in patients with CRC after surgery, facilitating physicians to appraise the individual survival of postoperative patients accurately and identify high-risk patients who need more aggressive treatment and follow-up strategies.",2020,Cancer Medicine
Structure of the substrate complex of thymidine kinase from Ureaplasma urealyticum and investigations of possible drug targets for the enzyme,"Thymidine kinases have been found in most organisms, from viruses and bacteria to mammals. Ureaplasma urealyticum (parvum), which belongs to the class of cell-wall-lacking Mollicutes, has no de novo synthesis of DNA precursors and therefore has to rely on the salvage pathway. Thus, thymidine kinase (Uu-TK) is the key enzyme in dTTP synthesis. Recently the 3D structure of Uu-TK was determined in a feedback inhibitor complex, demonstrating that a lasso-like loop binds the thymidine moiety of the feedback inhibitor by hydrogen bonding to main-chain atoms. Here the structure with the substrate deoxythymidine is presented. The substrate binds similarly to the deoxythymidine part of the feedback inhibitor, and the lasso-like loop binds the base and deoxyribose moieties as in the complex determined previously. The catalytic base, Glu97, has a different position in the substrate complex from that in the complex with the feedback inhibitor, having moved in closer to the 5â€²-OH of the substrate to form a hydrogen bond. The phosphorylation of and inhibition by several nucleoside analogues were investigated and are discussed in the light of the substrate binding pocket, in comparison with human TK1. Kinetic differences between Uu-TK and human TK1 were observed that may be explained by structural differences. The tight interaction with the substrate allows minor substitutions at the 3 and 5 positions of the base, only fluorine substitutions at the 2â€²-Ara position, but larger substitutions at the 3â€² position of the deoxyribose.",2005,FEBS Journal
Prey preferences in captivity of the freshwater crab Potamonautes lirrangensis from Lake Malawi with special emphasis on molluscivory,"Freshwater crabs play an important role for the diversification of shell morphologies in freshwater gastropods. For example, the radiation of the freshwater crab genus Platythelphusa in Lake Tanganyika is thought to have driven shell diversification of the lakeâ€™s snail fauna, promoting the evolution of thalassoid shells. No comparable thalassoid snails are known from Lake Malawi. Accordingly, it was hypothesized that the lakeâ€™s only freshwater crab, Potamonautes lirrangensis, is not a snail predator. We tested this hypothesis using feeding experiments with specimens caught in the southern part of Lake Malawi. Individual crabs were held in experimental containers offshore and were presented with various food items overnight, after which ingestion frequency was recorded. Potamonautes lirrangensis can be characterized as a scavenger that is opportunistically carnivorous. A preference for fish and snail flesh could be observed, indicating a bias toward carnivory. We observed occasional cracking of the shell in different snail species, with frequent ingestion of artificially crushed specimens, suggesting that crabs do attempt to feed on snails. However, the investigated Lake Malawi gastropods appear to be partly protected against crab predation through thick-walled and low-spired shells (especially Lanistes and Bellamya), obviating the evolution of thalassoid shells carrying rims, ridges, or spines.",2013,Hydrobiologia

"Characterization of pyrene degradation by halophilic Thalassospira sp. strain TSL5-1 isolated from the coastal soil of Yellow Sea, China","Abstract High molecular weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (HMW-PAHs) are more persistent and less bioavailable because of their poorer solubility in saline environments. In this study, a new halophilic bacterium capable of degrading various HMW-PAHs was isolated from the coastal soil of Yellow Sea, China. It was identified as Thalassospira sp. strain TSL5-1 based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and biochemical tests. Influences of salinity, pH and additional nutrients on pyrene degradation by TSL5-1 were investigated. The pyrene degradation could occur at salinity ranging from 0.5% to 19.5%, with optimal value kept between 3.5% and 5%. The degradation activity was affected greatly by pH fluctuation. Yeast could efficiently promote pyrene removal while peptone had the opposite effect. GCâ€“MS analysis revealed that the pyrene was degraded to generate a series of intermediates such as phenanthrene-4-carboxylic acid methyl ester, 2-hydroxy-2-H-benzo[h]chromene-2-carboxylic acid, 2-carboxylbenzaldehyde, phthalic acid and salicylic acid. Particularly, identification of phthalic acid and salicylic acid showed that phthalate and salicylic acid routes were simultaneously contained in the pyrene degradation, which was remarkably different from those for other pyrene-degraders. To our knowledge, it was the first time to propose a metabolic pathway of pyrene degradation by Thalassospira strains.",2016,International Biodeterioration & Biodegradation
Developing of predictive models for pneumonitis with forward variable selection and LASSO logistic model for breast cancer patients treated with 3D-CRT,"Abstract Purpose: To develop a multiple logistic regression model as normal tissue complication probability model by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) technique in breast cancer patients treated with three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT), we focused on the changes of pulmonary function tests to achieve the optimal predictive parameters for the occurrence of symptomatic radiation pneumonitis (SRP). Materials and methods: Dosimetric and spirometry data of 60 breast cancer patients were analyzed. Pulmonary function tests were done before RT, after completion of RT, 3, and 6 months after RT. Multiple logistic regression model was used to obtain the effective predictive parameters. Forward selection method was applied in NTCP model to determine the effective risk factors from obtained different parameters. Results: Symptomatic radiation pneumonitis was observed in five patients. Significant changes in pulmonary parameters have been observed at six months after RT. The parameters of mean lung dose (MLD), bridge separation (BS), mean irradiated lung volume (ILVmean), and the percentage of the ipsilateral lung volume that received dose of 20 Gy (IV20) introduced as risk factors using the LASSO technique for SRP in a multiple normal tissue complication probability model in breast cancer patients treated with 3D-CRT. The BS, central lung distance (CLD) and ILV in tangential field have obtained as 23.5 (20.9-26.0) cm, 2.4 (1.5-3.3) cm, and 12.4 (10.6-14.3) % of lung volume in radiation field in patients without pulmonary complication, respectively. Conclusion: The results showed that if BS, CLD, and ILV are more than 23 cm, 2 cm, and 12%, respectively, so incidence of SRP in the patients will be considerable. Our multiple NTCP LASSO model for breast cancer patients treated with 3D-CRT showed that in order to have minimum probability of SRP occurrence, parameters of BS, IV20, ILV and especially MLD would be kept in minimum levels. Considering dose-volume histogram, the mean lung dose factor is most important parameter which minimizing it in treatment planning, minimizes the probability of SRP and consequently improves the quality of life in breast cancer patients.",2018,Polish Journal of Medical Physics and Engineering

Prostate Segmentation in CT Images via Spatial-Constrained Transductive Lasso,"Accurate prostate segmentation in CT images is a significant yet challenging task for image guided radiotherapy. In this paper, a novel semi-automated prostate segmentation method is presented. Specifically, to segment the prostate in the current treatment image, the physician first takes a few seconds to manually specify the first and last slices of the prostate in the image space. Then, the prostate is segmented automatically by the proposed two steps: (i) The first step of prostate-likelihood estimation to predict the prostate likelihood for each voxel in the current treatment image, aiming to generate the 3-D prostate-likelihood map by the proposed Spatial-COnstrained Transductive LassO (SCOTO), (ii) The second step of multi-atlases based label fusion to generate the final segmentation result by using the prostate shape information obtained from the planning and previous treatment images. The experimental result shows that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods on prostate segmentation in a real prostate CT dataset, consisting of 24 patients with 330 images. Moreover, it is also clinically feasible since our method just requires the physician to spend a few seconds on manual specification of the first and last slices of the prostate.",2013,2013 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

Distributionally Robust Formulation and Model Selection for the Graphical Lasso,"Building on a recent framework for distributionally robust optimization in machine learning, we develop a similar framework for estimation of the inverse covariance matrix for multivariate data. We provide a novel notion of a Wasserstein ambiguity set specifically tailored to this estimation problem, from which we obtain a representation for a tractable class of regularized estimators. Special cases include penalized likelihood estimators for Gaussian data, specifically the graphical lasso estimator. As a consequence of this formulation, a natural relationship arises between the radius of the Wasserstein ambiguity set and the regularization parameter in the estimation problem. Using this relationship, one can directly control the level of robustness of the estimation procedure by specifying a desired level of confidence with which the ambiguity set contains a distribution with the true population covariance. Furthermore, a unique feature of our formulation is that the radius can be expressed in closed-form as a function of the ordinary sample covariance matrix. Taking advantage of this finding, we develop a simple algorithm to determine a regularization parameter for graphical lasso, using only the bootstrapped sample covariance matrices, meaning that computationally expensive repeated evaluation of the graphical lasso algorithm is not necessary. Alternatively, the distributionally robust formulation can also quantify the robustness of the corresponding estimator if one uses an off-the-shelf method such as cross-validation. Finally, we numerically study the obtained regularization criterion and analyze the robustness of other automated tuning procedures used in practice.",2019,ArXiv
