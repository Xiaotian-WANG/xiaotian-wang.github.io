Pathwise Coordinate Optimization,"We consider â€œone-at-a-timeâ€ coordinate-wise descent algorithms for a class of convex optimization problems. An algorithm of this kind has been proposed for the L1-penalized regression (lasso) in the literature, but it seems to have been largely ignored. Indeed, it seems that coordinate-wise algorithms are not often used in convex optimization. We show that this algorithm is very competitive with the well-known LARS (or homotopy) procedure in large lasso problems, and that it can be applied to related methods such as the garotte and elastic net. It turns out that coordinate-wise descent does not work in the â€œfused lasso,â€ however, so we derive a generalized algorithm that yields the solution in much less time that a standard convex optimizer. Finally, we generalize the procedure to the two-dimensional fused lasso, and demonstrate its performance on some image smoothing problems. 1. Introduction. In this paper we consider statistical models that lead to convex optimization problems with inequality constraints. Typically, the optimization for these problems is carried out using a standard quadratic programming algorithm. The purpose of this paper is to explore â€œone-at-a-timeâ€ coordinate-wise descent algorithms for these problems. The equivalent of a coordinate descent algorithm has been proposed for the L1-penalized regression (lasso) in the literature, but it is not commonly used. Moreover, coordinate-wise algorithms seem too simple, and they are not often used in convex optimization, perhaps because they only work in specialized problems. We ourselves never appreciated the value of coordinate descent methods for convex statistical problems before working on this paper. In this paper we show that coordinate descent is very competitive with the wellknown LARS (or homotopy) procedure in large lasso problems, can deliver a path of solutions efficiently, and can be applied to many other convex statistical problems such as the garotte and elastic net. We then go on to explore a nonseparable problem in which coordinate-wise descent does not workâ€”the â€œfused lasso.â€ We derive a generalized algorithm that yields the solution in much less time that a standard convex optimizer. Finally, we generalize the procedure to",2007,The Annals of Applied Statistics
Only a town planner would run a toxic- waste pipeline through a recreational area Planning and planners in the British press,"Given the many planning reforms underway, including the increasing emphasis on public participation, and the many high-profi le issues to which planning can be linked, it is an important time to refl ect on the media image of planning and planners. This paper draws on the results of a survey of newspaper coverage in British national and local papers in 2003â€04 to illustrate how planning and planners are being represented and framed in the media. The results of the survey suggest a frequently stereotypical and critical image in the national print media, with more of a focus on planning in action in the local press. A similar survey of the professional journal Planning suggests a mismatch in public and professional images of planning. Taken together, these results give cause for concern as to how planning is represented in the public press and it is argued that such â€˜planning pessimismâ€™ highlights the need for greater attention to media representations of planning and planners. Planning skills are in high demand in contemporary Britain, with the Egan Review (Egan, 2004) highlighting the central place of planning and planners in the creation of so-called â€˜Sustainable Communitiesâ€™. Yet, despite this renaissance for planning, Durning and Glasson (2004) highlight a 2001 Local Government Association survey which found that 87 per cent of English local authorities had experienced problems regarding the recruitment and retention of planning staff . They point to the poor image of the planning profession among the general public as a major cause of this problem.",2006,
Abstract 18245: Identifying Novel Predictors for Incident Heart Failure Using Statistical Learning Techniques in the Womenâ€™s Health Initiative (WHI) Cohort,"Introduction: Machine learning (statistical learning) techniques applied to high-dimensional health data may aid in identifying novel predictors of heart failure (HF). We used machine learning to identify novel predictors of HF in post-menopausal women and compared these models to an established HF risk model. Methods: After performing minimum-necessary data cleaning on all baseline WHI variables, 1227 variables remained. Without a priori input, we separately applied the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) technique with cross-validation, and Classification and Regression Trees (CART) to select sets of variables that are predictive for our primary outcome of incident heart failure hospitalization. We built Cox Proportional Hazards models using each set of predictors and using published predictors from the Atherosclerosis risk in Communities (ARIC) cohort. Model discrimination was compared using Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC). Results: Total sample size was 44,173; there were 2,355 outcomes and the median time to event was 8.7 years. LASSO and CART identified 12 and 9 significant predictors, respectively. The highest correlation between selected variables was 0.56. Selected novel predictors include physical function, Hodgkinâ€™s Lymphoma, prior pulmonary embolism, Medicare insurance, and use of cardiotonic, antiarrhythmic and mineral supplement medication among others. Other variables reflected known risk factors for HF (Table). In ROC analysis the model using CART variables had the highest C-statistic (0.794), followed by LASSO (0.775) and ARIC (0.712). Conclusions: When applied in the WHI, machine learning techniques can identify novel sets of variables without a priori input that yield risk prediction models with improved discrimination as compared to an established HF risk model. Both the models and the novel predictors provide a basis for hypothesis generation and future investigation.",2016,Circulation
49 In vitro dynamics of chromatin organization and migration,"The organization of eukaryotic chromatin is not static but changes as a function of cell status during processes such as proliferation, differentiation and migration. One major task of cell biologists is to develop technology and methodology for studying the chromatin organization without perturbing its function. A living cell is a dynamic object and conventional biochemical analyses do not provide spatial and temporal information. DNA quantification has not been extensively used to investigate chromatin dynamics in combination with cellular migration. In this context, an optimized, DNA specific, non perturbant method has been deve lopped for s tudying chromat in organization, using the fluorescent vital bisbenzimidazole probe Hoechst 33342 (Ho342, Paillasson et al, 1995). Computer-assisted image analysis was used to follow migratory activity and chromatin organization on living L929 fibroblasts. This approach is of interest for investigating: i) cell-extracellular matrix interactions, by using different substrates, ii) migratory response to chemotactic factors, and iii) in vitro wound assay, based on the ability of cells to migrate into a denuded scrapped off area. This model will provide efficient tools for functional and structural analysis of cell behavior. It is also interesting in order to gain a better understanding about drag action. It allows in situ xenobiotic action monitoring under varying living conditions. This work is supported by grants from Rdgion Rhone-Alpes, Universitd Joseph Fourier and the Association pour la Recherche sur le Cancer (ARC) and by a fellowship to A. Doisy from the Ligue Rdgionale Franfaise Contre le Cancer (LRFCC).",2004,Cell Biology and Toxicology
Comparison of machine learning algorithms for soil salinity predictions in three dryland oases located in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XJUAR) of China,"ABSTRACT Many different machine learning approaches have been applied for various purposes. However, there has been limited guidance regarding which, if any, machine learning models and covariate sets might be optimal for predicting soil salinity across different oases in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XJUAR) of China. This study aimed to compare five machine learning algorithms, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Multiple Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Random Forest tree ensembles (RF), and Stochastic Gradient Treeboost (SGT), to predict soil salinity in three geographically distinct areas (the Qitai, Kuqa, and Yutian oases). A total of 21 data sets from three oases were used to evaluate the performance of the algorithm and to screen the optimal variables. The results show the following indices are considered to be important indicators for quantitative assessment of soil salinity: EEVI, CSRI, EVI2, GDVI, SAIO, and SIT. Comparison results show that SGT is the most suitable algorithm for predicting soil salinity in arid areas. This study provides a comprehensive comparison of machine learning techniques for soil salinity prediction and may assist in the modeling and variable selection of digital soil mapping in the XJUAR of China.",2019,European Journal of Remote Sensing
Mortality risk factors in patients with gastric cancer using Bayesian and ordinary Lasso logistic models: a study in the Southeast of Iran,"Aim
The aim of this study was to apply two types of statistical models to determine the factors that influence the mortality rate in patients with gastric cancer.


Background
In Iran, gastric cancer ranks the first and second most prevalent among men and women, respectively. It is the first cause of death in Iran in both gendersival.


Methods
In this retrospective study, data were obtained from 339 (216 male) patients diagnosed with gastric cancer in the city of Kerman (South-East of Iran) during 2001-2015. In this study, ordinary and Bayesian Lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) logistic regression models, with goodness-of-fit indices, were compared and the models' risk factors were also determined.


Results
The mean age of the participants was 62.84 Â±14.53 years, and 12.4% of them were younger than 45 years. Also, the mortality rate was 57.7%. Gender, morphology of the tumor, and time of diagnosis were found to be significant factors in the mortality of the patients in both models. This study found that the Bayesian Lasso model had better fitness.


Conclusion
The high mortality rate of gastric cancer and its high prevalence at age below 45 years are alarming. Thus, great attention should be paid to prevention, early diagnosis, especially in females, and adenocarcinoma to improve the survival of patients with gastric cancer.",2020,Gastroenterology and Hepatology From Bed to Bench
"The Funeral in the Village: Urbanitesâ€™ Shifting Imaginations of Belonging, Mobility, and Community","Throughout Africa, the continuing involvement of urbanites with the village of originâ€”for some time, seen as a special trait of urbanization in the continentâ€”seems to be under heavy strain. For the Yoruba area, where urbanization has a relatively long history, Dan Aronson spoke in 1971 of â€œa single-role systemâ€ still uniting city and village, with people constantly moving to and fro between the two poles in different phases of their lives. In the same year, Joseph Gugler suggested for the Igbo, with their powerful â€œTribal Unions,â€ that urbanites lived in â€œa dual systemâ€ between city and village (1971). From quite a different perspective, Claude Meillassoux (1975) and Samir Amin (1973) characterized wage-laborers in Africa as â€œsemi-proletariansâ€ because most of them retained a footing in the village economy; this would be the explanation why wages in the capitalist sectors could remain relatively low as the costs of the reproduction of labor were borne by the village economy.",2014,
Asymptotic Analysis of MAP Estimation via the Replica Method and Applications to Compressed Sensing,"The replica method is a nonrigorous but well-known technique from statistical physics used in the asymptotic analysis of large, random, nonlinear problems. This paper applies the replica method, under the assumption of replica symmetry, to study estimators that are maximum a posteriori (MAP) under a postulated prior distribution. It is shown that with random linear measurements and Gaussian noise, the replica-symmetric prediction of the asymptotic behavior of the postulated MAP estimate of an -dimensional vector â€œdecouplesâ€ as scalar postulated MAP estimators. The result is based on applying a hardening argument to the replica analysis of postulated posterior mean estimators of Tanaka and of Guo and VerduÌ. The replica-symmetric postulated MAP analysis can be readily applied to many estimators used in compressed sensing, including basis pursuit, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), linear estimation with thresholding, and zero norm-regularized estimation. In the case of LASSO estimation, the scalar estimator reduces to a soft-thresholding operator, and for zero norm-regularized estimation, it reduces to a hard threshold. Among other benefits, the replica method provides a computationally tractable method for precisely predicting various performance metrics including mean-squared error and sparsity pattern recovery probability.",2012,IEEE Transactions on Information Theory
Use of tropical cleaner fish to control the ectoparasite Neobenedenia melleni (Monogenea: Capsalidae) on seawater-cultured Florida red tilapia,"Abstract The juvenile bluehead wrasse ( Thalassoma bifasciatum ), the neon goby ( Gobiosoma oceanops ) and the cleaning goby ( Gobiosoma genie ) were evaluated for their abilities to remove ectoparasitic monogeneans ( Neobenedenia melleni ) from seawater-cultured Florida red tilapia. Initial and final infection levels (number of monogeneans/fish) were monitored for individual tilapia maintained with and without cleaner fish in three 8-day trials. Initial infection levels varied widely among trials, with averages (Â± s.e.) of 412 Â± 103, 103 Â± 45 and 291 Â± 130 in trials 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Final infection levels on tilapia maintained without cleaners (controls) were significantly ( P P P > 0.05). The results demonstrate that cleaner fish, particularly the gobies, may be a viable biological method for controlling monogenean parasitosis in seawater-cultured tilapia.",1993,Aquaculture
L'invenzione del SestriÃ¨re,"II tema centrale di questa ricerca consiste nella ricostruzione e nell'analisi delle vicende che hanno portato alla formazione della piu importante localita turistica invernale piemontese, Sestriere. Nel breve lasso di tempo che va dal 1931 al 1939 si consuma il ""miracolo"" della trasformazione di un colle alpino a 2000 metri di altitudine: dove prima c'era solo un piccolo hotel circondato da pascoli, sorgono funivie, alberghi e tutte le attrezzature necessarie al funzionamento di una moderna stazione sciistica. La modernita irrompe all'improvviso nella fissita secolare della montagna. 
Questa tesi, che si riferisce specificatamente al primo decennio di vita della stazione, avrebbe potuto essere intitolata La nascita di Sestriere o La fondazione di Sestriere, invece e stato adottato il termine invenzione. La scelta deriva da una serie di valutazioni. Prima di tutto, su questo valico di collegamento tra la val Chisone e l'alta vai Susa si inventa un nuovo luogo, si costruisce concretamente un insediamento che prima non c'era. Ma l'invenzione del Sestriere va oltre questa banale considerazione: e l'invenzione di un nuovo modo di concettualizzare, vivere e costruire la montagna, estrema conseguenza di una modernita in divenire che nasce nelle possibilita offerte dagli sviluppi dell'ultima fase della rivoluzione industriale, dallo sport, dal consumo del tempo libero. E' l'invenzione di una stazione integrata senza esempi ne precedenti, pianificata per la pratica dello sci alpino: per la prima volta l'insediamento viene concepito in relazione alle piste di discesa, insieme al domarne skiable. E' l'invenzione di un modo moderno di gestione della localita turistica: acquisto delle aree, progettazione, costruzione, organizzazione alberghiera e sportiva, promozione, sono aspetti complementari delle capacita di un unico gruppo dirigente di stampo manageriale. Ancora, e l'invenzione di una citta di fondazione basata sulla mobilita automobilistica: le strade, i parcheggi, le autorimesse, lo sgombero meccanizzato della neve sono parte fondamentale del progetto complessivo. Ma e anche l'invenzione di un diverso approccio architettonico allo spazio montano: lo stile della tradizione viene abbandonato a favore di forme schiettamente moderne, razionali e funzionali, prodotti della cultura urbana e industriale che le ha concepite. E' l'invenzione di un insolito paesaggio alpino in cui l'artificiale si inserisce in antitesi con la natura, come segno forte e caratterizzante, quasi metafisico, creando un nuovo panorama, un nuovo scenario simbolico. Questo studio si propone di far emergere tale complessita di valori e significati, analizzando le ragioni e le modalita della costruzione di Sestriere. Da una parte vi e dunque un interesse storico nel tentativo di colmare un vuoto, ordinare gli avvenimenti, restituire un nome e un ruolo ai protagonisti; dall'altra si cerca di valutare e riflettere su un episodio fondamentale nel lungo processo di scoperta e conquista delle Alpi operato dalla civilta urbana durante le diverse fasi della modernita.",2010,

Surface influences of glass substrates on lattice parameters and phase transition temperature of evaporated Ge thin films,"The substrate temperature Ts during evaporation of Ge thin films highly determines the preparation of amorphous or polycrystalline films. In between these â€œphasesâ€ there exist characteristically sharp and different amorphous-polycrystalline transition temperatures Tst on Duran 50 and Menzel HW glass substrates which are 135 and 235 Â°C, respectively. It is demonstrated that these transition temperatures of Ge films on glass depend on the kind of glass and its surface properties. The results are deduced by X-ray analysis of the crystallites in the polycrstalline films and are checked out by electron microscopic studies of the glass and film surfaces.

A Study on the Current Situation of English Education for Military Aviation Personnel,"The purpose of this study is to present the current English education programs available in the Republic of Korea Air Force, identify any potential problems, and suggest improvements to develop a customized ESP aviation English course. A total of 39 students (15 pilots and 24 air traffic controllers) and three English teachers of the school participated in the study. The data sources in this study included two classobservations, a survey questionnaire, and personal interviews with three English teachers. The questionnaire given to the students composed of 14 items, and four interview questions were given to the three English teachers. The findings were discussed in the following categories: general perceptions of the course, specific job-related needs, and suggestions for the programâ€™s improvement.

14 Improving Human-Robot Interaction through Interface Evolution,"In remote robot operations, the human operator(s) and robot(s) are working in different locations that are not within line of sight of each other. In this situation, the humanâ€™s knowledge of the robotâ€™s surroundings, location, activities and status is gathered solely through the interface. Depending on the work context, having a good understanding of the robotâ€™s state can be critical. Insufficient knowledge in an urban search and rescue (USAR) situation, for example, may result in the operator driving the robot into a shaky support beam, causing a secondary collapse. While the robotâ€˜s sensors and autonomy modes should help avoid collisions, in some cases the human must direct the robotsâ€˜ operation. If the operator does not have good awareness of the robotâ€™s state, the robot can be more of a detriment to the task than a benefit. The humanâ€™s comprehension of the robotâ€™s state and environment is known as situation awareness (SA). Endsley developed the most generally accepted definition for SA: â€œThe perception of elements in the environment within a volume of time and space [Level 1 SA], the comprehension of their meaning [Level 2 SA] and the projection of their status in the near future [Level 3 SA]â€ (Endsley, 1988). Drury, Scholtz, and Yanco (2003) redefined this definition of situation awareness to make it more specific to robot operations, breaking it into five categories: human-robot awareness (the humanâ€™s understanding of the robot), human-human awareness, robot-human awareness (the robotâ€™s information about the human), robot-robot awareness, and the humansâ€™ overall mission awareness. In this chapter, we focus on two of the five types of awareness that relate to a case in which one human operator is working with one robot: human-robot awareness and the humanâ€™s overall mission awareness. Adams (2007) discusses the implications for human-unmanned vehicle SA at each of the three levels of SA (perception, comprehension, and projection). In Drury, Keyes, and Yanco (2007), human-robot awareness is further decomposed into five types to aid in assessing the operatorâ€™s understanding of the robot: location awareness, activity awareness, surroundings awareness, status awareness and overall mission awareness (LASSO). The two types that are primarily addressed in this chapter are location awareness and surroundings awareness. Location awareness is the operatorâ€™s knowledge of where the robot is situated on a larger scale (e.g., knowing where the robot is from where it started or that it is at a certain point on a map). Surroundings awareness is the knowledge the operator has of the robotâ€™s circumstances in a local sense, such as when there is an",2018,
Prevention of mosquito nuisance among urban populations in Burkina Faso.,"This paper addresses the problems of mosquito control in urban areas of Burkina Faso. The main objectives are to examine relevant socio-cultural aspects in relation to a mosquito control intervention using a biolarvicide with main emphasis on local perceptions of mosquito nuisance and existing practices of mosquito control, including the cost of protective measures at household level. This is the report of an inter-disciplinary research project carried out in the two major towns of Burkina Faso, Bobo-Dioulasso and Ouagadougou, in 1999 and 2000, respectively. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used in the ethnographic part of the study. Two questionnaire surveys were conducted in both study areas: one prior to the intervention (n=1083) and the other after the intervention of the treatments with bio-larvicide (n=956). In addition, 70 in-depth interviews and 17 focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted. The findings show that mosquitoes are considered an important problem in the urban areas, both as a nuisance and a health risk and that the local population is very active in applying mosquito control measures at the household level. The intervention project was received positively by the local population with a decline in the perceived level of annoyance. The causal relationship between mosquitoes and malaria is clear, but the explanatory framework of the relationship between mosquitoes and other diseases is still under debate. The most common prevention methods are mosquito coils and aerosol spray, even though bed nets are perceived to be the most efficient and effective method. The investments in coils and aerosol sprays alone would mean an increase of 40% in the national figures for health expenditure at household level.",2004,Social science & medicine
"Halocynthiibacter namhaensis gen. nov., sp. nov., a novel alphaproteobacterium isolated from sea squirt Halocynthia roretzi","Abstract
A Gram-negative, non-motile and rod-shaped bacterial strain, designated RA2-3T, was isolated from a sea squirt (Halocynthia roretzi) collected from the South Sea, Korea, and its taxonomic position was investigated by using a polyphasic approach. Strain RA2-3T was observed to grow optimally at 25Â Â°C, at pH 7.0â€“7.5 and in the presence of 2Â % (w/v) NaCl. Strain RA2-3T exhibited the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity values to the type strains of Litoreibacter meonggei (95.7Â %), Planktotalea frisia (95.6Â %), Thalassobius gelatinovorus (95.5Â %) and Pelagicola litoralis (95.4Â %). A neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain RA2-3T clustered with the type strains of Planktotalea frisia, Pelagicola litoralis, Pacificibactermaritimus and Roseovariusmarinus. Strain RA2-3T was found to contain Q-10 as the predominant ubiquinone and C18:1Ï‰7c as the major fatty acid. The major polar lipids detected in strain RA2-3T were phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylglycerol, one unidentified aminolipid and one unidentified lipid. The DNA G+C content of strain RA2-3T was 52.9Â mol%. On the basis of the phylogenetic, chemotaxonomic and phenotypic properties, strain RA2-3T is considered to represent a new genus and species within the family Rhodobacteraceae, for which the name Halocynthiibacter namhaensis gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of H. namhaensis is RA2-3T (=KCTC 32362T=NBRC 109999T).",2014,Antonie van Leeuwenhoek

Nonnegative adaptive lasso for ultra-high dimensional regression models and a two-stage method applied in financial modeling,"Abstract This paper proposes the nonnegative adaptive lasso method for variable selection both in the classical fixed p setting (OLS initial estimator) and the ultra-high dimensional setting (root-n-consistent initial estimator). This method is an extension of the adaptive lasso with nonnegative constraint on the coefficients. It is shown to have asymptotic unbiasedness, asymptotic normality and variable selection consistency and its mean squared error decays fast too. Comparing with other procedures, nonnegative adaptive lasso satisfies oracle properties and can select the true variables under fewer assumptions. To get the solution of the nonnegative adaptive lasso, we extend the multiplicative approach for computing. This algorithm is valid for the general framework where the number of regression parameters p is allowed to very large. Simulations are performed to illustrate above results. The constrained index tracking problem in the stock market without short sales is studied in the empirical part. A two-stage method, nonnegative adaptive lasso + nonnegative LS, is applied in the financial modeling. The tracking results indicate that nonnegative adaptive lasso and the two-stage method can both get small tracking error and is successful in assets selection.",2016,Journal of Statistical Planning and Inference
The prognostic value of a seven-microRNA classifier as a novel biomarker for the prediction and detection of recurrence in glioma patients,"Glioma is often diagnosed at a later stage, and the high risk of recurrence remains a major challenge. We hypothesized that the microRNA expression profile may serve as a biomarker for the prognosis and prediction of glioblastoma recurrence. We defined microRNAs that were associated with good and poor prognosis in 300 specimens of glioblastoma from the Cancer Genome Atlas. By analyzing microarray gene expression data and clinical information from three random groups, we identified 7 microRNAs that have prognostic and prognostic accuracy: microRNA-124a, microRNA-129, microRNA-139, microRNA-15b, microRNA-21, microRNA-218 and microRNA-7. The differential expression of these miRNAs was verified using an independent set of glioma samples from the Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University. We used the log-rank test and the Kaplan-Meier method to estimate correlations between the miRNA signature and disease-free survival/overall survival. Using the LASSO model, we observed a uniform significant difference in disease-free survival and overall survival between patients with high-risk and low-risk miRNA signature scores. Furthermore, the prognostic capability of the seven-miRNA signature was demonstrated by receiver operator characteristic curve analysis. A Circos plot was generated to examine the network of genes and pathways predicted to be targeted by the seven-miRNA signature. The seven-miRNA-based classifier should be useful in the stratification and individualized management of patients with glioma.",2016,Oncotarget
Structured Detection of Interactions with the Directed Lasso,"When considering low-dimensional geneâ€“treatment or geneâ€“environment interactions, we might suspect groups of genes to interact with treatment or environment in a similar way. For example, genes associated with related biological processes might interact with an environmental factor or a clinical treatment in its effect on a phenotype correspondingly. We use the idea of a structured interaction model together with penalized regression to limit the model complexity in a model in which we believe the interactions might behave in a similar way. We propose the directed lasso, a regression modeling strategy using a pairwise fused lasso penalty to encourage interaction model simplicity through fusion of effect size. We compare the performance of the directed lasso to the lasso and other methods in a simulation study and on data sampled from a breast cancer clinical trial.",2017,Statistics in Biosciences

Body mass estimation in xenarthra: a predictive equation suitable for all quadrupedal terrestrial placentals?,"The Magnorder Xenarthra includes strange extinct groups, like glyptodonts, similar to large armadillos, and ground sloths, terrestrial relatives of the extant tree sloths. They have created considerable paleobiological interest in the last decades; however, the ecology of most of these species is still controversial or unknown. The body mass estimation of extinct species has great importance for paleobiological reconstructions. The commonest way to estimate body mass from fossils is through linear regression. However, if the studied species does not have similar extant relatives, the allometric pattern described by the regression could differ from those shown by the extinct group. That is the case for glyptodonts and ground sloths. Thus, stepwise multiple regression were developed including extant xenarthrans (their taxonomic relatives) and ungulates (their size and ecological relatives). Cases were weighted to maximize the taxonomic evenness. Twenty-eight equations were obtained. The distribution of the percent of prediction error (%PE) was analyzed between taxonomic groups (Perissodactyla, Artiodactyla, and Xenarthra) and size groups (0-20 kg, 20-300 kg, and more than 300 kg). To assess the predictive power of the functions, equations were applied to species not included in the regression development [test set cross validation, (TSCV)]. Only five equations had a homogeneous %PE between the aforementioned groups. These were applied to five extinct species. A mean body mass of 80 kg was estimated for Propalaehoplophorus australis (Cingulata: Glyptodontidae), 594 kg for Scelidotherium leptocephalum (Phyllophaga: Mylodontidae), and 3,550.7 kg for Lestodon armatus (Phyllophaga: Mylodontidae). The high scatter of the body mass estimations obtained for Catonyx tarijensis (Phyllophaga: Mylodontidae) and Thalassocnus natans (Phyllophaga: Megatheriidae), probably due to different specializations, prevented us from predicting its body mass. Surprisingly, although obtained from ungulates and xenarthrans, these five selected equations were also able to predict the body mass of species from groups as different as rodents, carnivores, hyracoideans, or tubulidentates. This result suggests the presence of a complex common allometric pattern for all quadrupedal placentals.",2008,Journal of morphology
A 10-gene prognostic methylation signature for stage Iâ€“III cervical cancer,"Cervical cancer (CC) patients usually have poor prognosis. The present study aims to find a DNA methylation signature for predicting survival of CC patients. We selected CC patients at pathological stage Iâ€“III with corresponding information on radiotherapy and overall survival (OS) from TCGA. Differential expression and methylation analysis was done between patients with and without radiotherapy. We selected feature genes using recursive feature elimination algorithm to build a support vector machine classifier. DNA methylation biomarkers predictive of prognosis were identified using a LASSO Cox-Proportional Hazards model to construct a prognostic scoring model. The classifier and the prognostic model were tested on the training set and the validation set. Nomogram combining risk score and prognostic clinical factors were used. We obtained 497 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 865 differentially methylated genes (DMGs). Fifteen feature genes were selected from the 292 common genes between the DEGs and the DMGs to construct a classification model for radiotherapy. A DNA methylation signature including 10 genes was identified and used to establish a prognostic scoring model. The 10-gene methylation signature could effectively separate patients into two risk groups with markedly different OS time. Predictive capability of the methylation signature was successfully confirmed on the validation set. A nomogram comprised of risk score, radiotherapy, and recurrence was applied, with calibration plots displaying good concordance between predicted and actual OS. The DEGs were involved in 12 KEGG pathways most of which were correlated with metastasis and proliferation of various cancers, such as pathways in cancer, basal cell carcinoma, transcriptional misregulation in cancer and ECMâ€“receptor interaction. We Identified a 10-gene methylation signature for risk stratification of CC patients at pathological stages Iâ€“III, and ten methylation biomarkers might be novel therapeutic targets for CC.",2020,Archives of Gynecology and Obstetrics
Predicting progression from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease using longitudinal callosal atrophy,"INTRODUCTION
We investigate whether longitudinal callosal atrophy could predict conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD).


METHODS
Longitudinal (baselineÂ +Â 1-year follow-up) MRI scans of 132 MCI subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative were used. A total of 54 subjects did not convert to AD over an average (Â±SD) follow-up of 5.46 (Â±1.63) years, whereas 78 converted to AD with an average conversion time of 2.56 (Â±1.65) years. Annual change in the corpus callosum thickness profile was calculated from the baseline and 1-year follow-up MRI. A logistic regression model with fused lasso regularization for prediction was applied to the annual changes.


RESULTS
We found a sex difference. The accuracy of prediction was 84% in females and 61% in males. The discriminating regions of corpus callosum differed between sexes. In females, the genu, rostrum, and posterior body had predictive power, whereas the genu and splenium were relevant in males.


DISCUSSION
Annual callosal atrophy predicts MCI-to-AD conversion in females more accurately than in males.",2016,"Alzheimer's & Dementia : Diagnosis, Assessment & Disease Monitoring"
No evidence for the 'expensive-tissue hypothesis' from an intraspecific study in a highly variable species.,"The 'expensive-tissue hypothesis' states that investment in one metabolically costly tissue necessitates decreased investment in other tissues and has been one of the keystone concepts used in studying the evolution of metabolically expensive tissues. The trade-offs expected under this hypothesis have been investigated in comparative studies in a number of clades, yet support for the hypothesis is mixed. Nevertheless, the expensive-tissue hypothesis has been used to explain everything from the evolution of the human brain to patterns of reproductive investment in bats. The ambiguous support for the hypothesis may be due to interspecific differences in selection, which could lead to spurious results both positive and negative. To control for this, we conduct a study of trade-offs within a single species, Thalassoma bifasciatum, a coral reef fish that exhibits more intraspecific variation in a single tissue (testes) than is seen across many of the clades previously analysed in studies of tissue investment. This constitutes a robust test of the constraints posited under the expensive-tissue hypothesis that is not affected by many of the factors that may confound interspecific studies. However, we find no evidence of trade-offs between investment in testes and investment in liver or brain, which are typically considered to be metabolically expensive. Our results demonstrate that the frequent rejection of the expensive-tissue hypothesis may not be an artefact of interspecific differences in selection and suggests that organisms may be capable of compensating for substantial changes in tissue investment without sacrificing mass in other expensive tissues.",2012,Journal of evolutionary biology
Locating rare and weak material anomalies by convex demixing of propagating wavefields,"This paper considers the problem of detecting and localizing material anomalies in solid structures, given spatiotemporal observations at a pre-defined grid of points that collectively describe the material displacement resulting from an induced, propagating acoustic surface wave. We propose an approach that seeks to separate or â€œdemixâ€ each temporal snapshot of the propagating wavefield into its constituent components, which are assumed to be morphologically dissimilar in the vicinity of material defects. We cast this demixing approach as a group lasso regression task, characterized by morphologically dissimilar dictionaries, and establish conditions under which material anomalies may be accurately identified using this approach. We demonstrate and validate the performance of this approach on synthetic data as well as real-world data.",2015,2015 IEEE 6th International Workshop on Computational Advances in Multi-Sensor Adaptive Processing (CAMSAP)
[From economic difficulties to social suffering of people living with HIV in Burkina Faso].,"A qualitative study conducted in 2006 shows that many people in Burkina Faso, living with HIV and receiving antiretroviral treatment (ART), have difficulties in meeting the expenses related to care. This anthropological analysis considers their perceptions, the causes and the social impact of these economic problems. This research is based on semi-structured interviews with 35 people living with HIV (PLWHIV) infection, contacted through HIV care programs in Ouagadougou, Bobo-Dioulasso and Ouahigouya. After recording, transcribing and indexing the interviews, we analysed them. Even when they did not have to pay for treatment, most of the subjects faced economic problems dealing with follow-up care and monitoring, transportation, and other expenses, and these problems occur when PLWHIV have already faced the long, complex and expensive therapeutic itinerary before the test that diagnosed HIV infection. The new diet required by the treatment is also mentioned. Moreover, work problems often due to the disease (low output at work, inability to work, job loss) have already decreased patients' income by the time they get treatment. It is not easy for them to return to the level of resources they had before their disease, even if they can find a job. This financial exhaustion frequently leads to the exclusion of PLWHIV from their former solidarity networks, mostly because they can no longer participate in collective contributions or return what they were given when they were totally dependent. The analysis of these conversations shows the relevance of the concept of ""social suffering"" in describing the social effects of the economic problems that face many PLWHIV on ART, even when treatment is subsidized.",2008,Sante
Mechanics of MetacarpophalangealÂ Joint Extension.,"PURPOSE
It is a common belief that extension of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint of the finger is achieved via the sagittal bands acting as a sling or lasso to attach the extensor tendon to the base of the proximal phalanx. The aim of this study was to test the hypotheses that (1) division of the sagittal bands reduces extension force or torque of the MCP joint, and (2) division of the extensor tendon distal to the sagittal band will not affect the extension force or torque of the MCP joint.


METHODS
Ten cadaver limbs were secured to a jig to allow for testing of the extension force of the MCP joints of the index, middle, and ring fingers. A 1-kg load was applied to the forearm extensor digitorum communis tendon and the extension force was measured with the MCP joint positioned at 0Â° (neutral extension) and again at 45Â° flexion. These measurements were repeated after the sagittal bands were divided in 15 specimens; in the other 15 specimens, the extensor tendon was divided just distal to the sagittal bands.


RESULTS
After sagittal band division, extension force was similar in the 2 groups (0.11 N reduction after division with the MCP joints in neutral and 0.14 N in 45Â° flexion). There was significantly less extension force after division of the extensor tendon in both joint positions (0.95 N reduction after division in neutral extension and 0.66 N in 45Â° flexion).


CONCLUSIONS
The sagittal bands do not primarily extend the MCP as a sling or lasso. The extensor tendon continuation to the extensor hood and middle phalanx is the major extension motor. The MCP joint is extended by the torque generated by the extensor tendon passing the joint carrying a force and possessing an extension moment arm.


CLINICAL RELEVANCE
This principle should be correctly understood in the literature to ensure that clinical decisions related to injury and/or repair of the extensor tendon and sagittal bands are based on a sound understanding of their mechanics.",2018,The Journal of hand surgery
"Late Changhsingian Fauna of the Northwestern Caucasus Mountains, Russia","Abstract Upper Changhsingian strata occur as isolated outcrops in the Malaya Laba and Belaya river basins in the Peredovoy Range of the northwestern Caucasus Mountains and include shelfal limestone, reefal and biohermal buildups, and terrigenous clastics, here placed in the Belalabinskaya Group. These lithofacies contain a varied and rich assemblage of brachiopods, bivalves, ammonoids, inozoan sponges, and algae. This biota is Late Changhsingian in age and correlates with similar biotas described in south China, the Pamir Mountains, South Primorye in far eastern Russia, and Transcaucasia. The brachiopod genera and biotic assemblages are very similar to those of the Cathaysian Subprovince of the Tethyan Province. Two new families, Labaellidae and Licharewiconchidae; four new genera, Labaella, Licharewiconcha, Tethysiella, and Nikitinia; a new diagnosis of Caucasoproductus; and four new species of brachiopods, Rhipidomella caucasica, Cathaysia caucasica, Nikitinia licharewi, and Licharewina praetriassica, are described.

Regional variability of controls on post-fire watershed system flow response,"This research investigates the impact of wildfires on watershed flow regimes throughout the continental United States, specifically focusing on evaluation of national fire events within specified subregions and determination of the impact of climate and geophysical variables in post- fire flow response. Fire events were collected through federal and state-level databases and streamflow data were collected from U.S. Geological Survey stream gages. 428 watersheds were identified with at least 10 years of continuous pre-fire daily streamflow records and 5 years of continuous post-fire daily flow records. For each watershed, percent changes in annual seven day low-flows (7Q2) and annual seven day high-flows (7Q10) were calculated from pre- to post-fire. 12 independent variables were identified for each watershed and fire event, including topographic, land cover, and soils data. The national watersheds were divided into eight regions and a lasso linear regression model, applying the Leave-One-Out calibration method, was calculated for each region. Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) was used to determine the accuracy of the resulting models. Moran's I and Localized Indicators of Spatial Autocorrelation (LISAs) were calculated for all model residuals to test for spatial autocorrelation. The South East Coast Plains, Eastern Highlands, and Western Plains regions produced the most accurate linear models and displayed no spatial autocorrelation. The Western Mountain and Central Plains region models produced spatially autocorrelated residuals, indicating that the regions need to be further subdivided. Results of linear regression modeling showed varying importance of watershed and fire event variables, with conflicting correlation between land cover types and soil types by region. Addition of further independent variables, such as burn severity and further subdivision of land cover types, is ongoing and should allow for more accurate linear regression modeling.",2015,
"Winogradskyella pacifica sp. nov., a marine bacterium of the family Flavobacteriaceae.","A novel strain, designated KMM 6019T, was isolated from coastal seawater and subjected to taxonomic examination using a polyphasic approach. A comparative analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain KMM 6019T formed a distinct phyletic line within the genus Winogradskyella, a member of the family Flavobacteriaceae, phylum Bacteroidetes. The 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity between the novel isolate and the type strains of the recognized species of the genus Winogradskyella was 94.0-97.8%. Winogradskyella thalassocola KMM 3907T was the closest relative, with 97.8% sequence similarity. The predominant fatty acids of strain KMM 6019T were iso-C15:0, iso-C15:1, anteiso-C15:0, iso-C15:0 3-OH, iso-C16:0 3-OH, C15:0, iso-C17:0 3-OH and summed feature 3 comprising iso-C15:0 2-OH and/or C16:1omega7c, which are characteristic for members of the genus Winogradskyella. The DNA G+C content was 35.3 mol%. Strain KMM 6019T moved by gliding and grew with 1-5% NaCl and at 4-30 degrees C. The novel strain degraded gelatin, casein and starch and produced acid from cellobiose, d-glucose and maltose. Strain KMM 6019T could clearly be differentiated from the other Winogradskyella species by the ability to utilize inositol and sorbitol and to produce hydrogen sulphide. On the basis of phylogenetic and phenotypic findings, strain KMM 6019T is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Winogradskyella, for which the name Winogradskyella pacifica sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is KMM 6019T (=KCTC 22997T=LMG 22568T).",2010,International journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology
Development and validation of a novel and robust blood small nuclear RNA signature in diagnosing autism spectrum disorder,"Reliable molecular signatures are needed to improve the early and accurate diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and indicate physicians to provide timely intervention. This study aimed to identify a robust blood small nuclear RNA (snRNA) signature in diagnosing ASD. 186 blood samples in the microarray dataset were randomly divided into the training set (nâ€Š=â€Š112) and validation set (nâ€Š=â€Š72). Then, the microarray probe expression profiles were re-annotated into the expression profiles of 1253 snRNAs though probe sequence mapping. In the training set, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) penalized generalized linear model was adopted to identify the 9-snRNA signature (RNU1-16P, RNU6-1031P, RNU6-258P, RNU6-335P, RNU6-485P, RNU6-549P, RNU6-98P, RNU6ATAC26P, and RNVU1-15), and a diagnostic score was calculated for each sample according to the snRNA expression levels and the model coefficients. The score demonstrated a good diagnostic ability for ASD in the training set (area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)â€Š=â€Š0.90), validation set (AUCâ€Š=â€Š0.87), and the overall (AUCâ€Š=â€Š0.88). Moreover, the blood samples of 23 ASD patients and 23 age- and gender-matched controls were collected as the external validation set, in which the signature also showed a good diagnostic ability for ASD (AUCâ€Š=â€Š0.88). In subgroup analysis, the signature was robust when considering the confounders of gender, age, and disease subtypes, and displayed a significantly better performance among the female and younger cases (Pâ€Š=â€Š.039; Pâ€Š=â€Š.002). In comparison with a 55-gene signature deriving from the same dataset, the snRNA signature showed a better diagnostic ability (AUC: 0.88 vs 0.80, Pâ€Š=â€Š.049). In conclusion, this study identified a novel and robust blood snRNA signature in diagnosing ASD, which might help improve the diagnostic accuracy for ASD in clinical practice. Nevertheless, a large-scale prospective study was needed to validate our results.",2019,Medicine

"Redeployment of proximally misplaced self-expandable metallic stent in an inoperable esophageal carcinoma, using an overtube technique.","Placement of self-expandable metallic stents (SEMSs) has been demonstrated to be a safe palliative procedure for patients with inoperable esophageal cancer and dysphagia [1,2]. When deployed distally from the stricture, most SEMSs can be repositioned endoscopically by pulling the lasso attached to the proximal end of the SEMS. However, if the deployment of the SEMS is completely proximal from the stricture, endoscopic repositioning of the SEMS is challenging. We report here a novel method for redeploying a proximally misplaced SEMS using an overtube. A 70-year-old man attended our institution because of progressive dysphagia andweight loss. Upper endoscopy showed an esophageal tumor near the esophagogastric junction. Abdominal ultrasonography showed multiple liver tumors. Histopathological investigation confirmed the diagnosis of esophageal carcinoma with liver metastasis. A SEMS (Evolution, 12 cm; Cook Endoscopy, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, USA) was placed for the palliative treatment of dysphagia. However, the SEMS was misplaced in a position proximal to the esophageal carcinoma (â—"" Fig.1). Because the SEMS could not be repositioned distally after full deployment, a self-made transparent overtube with an internal diameter of 6mm was used to retract the SEMS.

"Genetic aetiology of blood pressure relates to aortic stiffness with bi-directional causality: evidence from heritability, blood pressure polymorphisms, and Mendelian randomization.","AIMS
Haemodynamic determinants of blood pressure (BP) include cardiac output (CO), systemic vascular resistance (SVR), and arterial stiffness. We investigated the heritability of these phenotypes, their association with BP-related single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and the causal association between BP and arterial stiffness.


METHODS AND RESULTS
We assessed BP, central BP components, and haemodynamic properties (during a single visit) including CO, SVR, and pulse wave velocity (PWV, measure of arterial stiffness) in 3531 (1934 monozygotic, 1586 dizygotic) female TwinsUK participants. Heritability was estimated using structural equation modelling. Association with 984 BP-associated SNP was examined using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and generalized estimating equation regression. One and two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) was used to estimate the causal direction between BP and arterial stiffness including data on 436Â 419 UK Biobank participants. We found high heritability for systolic and pulsatile components of BP (>50%) and PWV (65%) with overlapping genes accounting for >50% of their observed correlation. Environmental factors explained most of the variability of CO and SVR (>80%). Regression identified SNPs (n = 5) known to be associated with BP to also be associated with PWV. One-sample MR showed evidence of bi-directional causal association between BP and PWV in TwinsUK participants. Two-sample MR, confirmed a bi-directional causal effect of PWV on BP (inverse variance weighted (IVW) beta = 0.11, P < 0.02) and BP on arterial stiffness (IVW beta = 0.004, P < 0.0001).


CONCLUSION
The genetic basis of BP is mediated not only by genes regulating BP but also by genes that influence arterial stiffness. Mendelian randomization indicates a bi-directional causal association between BP and arterial stiffness.",2020,European heart journal

Different Guises,"It is with a good measure of irony that Carol Novackâ€™s first full-length collection, Giraffes in Hiding, is subtitled The Mythical Memoirs of Carol Novack. The collection consists of over forty genre-bending pieces that hardly amount to the kind of inspirational narratives with which we often associate memoir. Indeed, Novack is more interested in wrestling with language and form than in charting a path of personal growth. She takes the miscellany of our lives and audaciously reshapes it into unexpected forms like play-poems, emails, conceptual games, pseudo-reviews, and dreams. Of course, as the ironic nod to memoir suggests, Giraffes in Hiding does entertain a significant autobiographical impulse. In particular, a number of pieces explore the cultivation of bold artistic sensibilities that happen to look a lot like Novackâ€™s. The opening story, â€œMinnows,â€ for instance, pits an imaginative young girl against her more practical twin sister. The protagonist uses â€œa crazy rainbow of Crayolasâ€ to color a set of paper minnows, but her sister insists on coloring a set of giraffes yellow and brown. Whereas the protagonist proceeds to swim with her minnows â€œwhere no one could find us,â€ her sister scoffs at the idea of hiding. â€œWhy would giraffes want to hide?â€ the sister asks. Novack clearly appreciates the minnowsâ€™ evasiveness, their slippery beauty. At once everywhere and nowhere, the minnows embody some of the best images in Novackâ€™s collectionâ€”that is to say, those that inconspicuously flit from one piece to another with no concern for practicalities. Art returns as a theme throughout Giraffes in Hiding, albeit in different guises. A number of Novackâ€™s characters, if not actual artists, are prolific creators in conflict with those who want to manage or destroy their creations. In â€œWhat to Do with the Babies,â€ for instance, the protagonist struggles to protect her unruly babies from men who want to lasso them. In other cases, characters end up compromising their creations for the sake of approval and acceptance. It is no wonder this theme concerns Novack. Giraffes in Hiding demonstrates an exuberance of language, sound, and literary device that borders on out of control. Novackâ€™s writing abounds with recklessly satisfying similes like â€œThe heavens turned dense ash blue like hospice hairâ€ and â€œI spoke gradually in a voice that felt far away, like a fish sleeping on the bottom of a deep pond.â€ With subject matter ranging from the mundane to the fantastic, her collection is full of striking juxtapositions and incongruous pairings. Indeed, Novack seems as comfortable wielding the mythology of Pandora and Oedipus as that of prom queens and football heroes. Yet while many of her juxtapositions are playful, others carry a dark undercurrent. For instance, in â€œI Am Not Nor Have I Ever Been,â€ distressing memories of girls tormenting a peer at summer camp in the Catskills serve as backstory for a postapocalyptic interrogation scene. While Novackâ€™s treatment of language succeeds in opening up fresh perspectives on family, sexuality, infidelity, and mortality, it does not exactly lend itself to narrative closure. Novack is aware of the impatience with which some readers might approach it. In this light, her story â€œDestinationâ€ almost looks like her own personal allegory of reading: â€œOn the hill, there is an easel holding a painting of a town. You are always traveling to the town, but wherever you think youâ€™ve arrived, there is nothing but stones, statues and indigestible bread. You return to the painting.â€ Like this traveler, Novackâ€™s reader is always in transit, but never quite arrives.",2011,American Book Review
Nomogram for radiation-induced hypothyroidism prediction in nasopharyngeal carcinoma after treatment.,"OBJECTIVE
The aim of this study was to develop a nomogram for radiation-induced hypothyroidism (RHT) prediction.


METHODS
We collected data from 164 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in our previous prospective study. Biochemical hypothyroidism was defined as a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level greater than the normal value. We collected both clinical and dose-volume factors. A univariate Cox regression analysis was performed to identify RHT risk factors. Optimal predictors were selected according to the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). We then selected the Cox regression models that best balanced the prediction performance and practicability to build a nomogram for RHT prediction.


RESULTS
There were 38 (23.2%) patients who developed RHT, and the median follow-up was 24 months. The univariate Cox regression analysis indicated that gender, minimum dose, mean dose (Dmean) and V25-V60 [Vx (%), the percentage of thyroid volume receiving >xâ€‰Gy] of the thyroid were significantly associated with RHT. The variables of gender, receiving chemotherapy or not (chemo), Dmean and V50 were selected using the LASSO analysis. A nomogram based on a three-variable (gender, chemo and V50) Cox regression model was constructed, and its concordance index was 0.72. Good accordance between prediction and observation was showed by calibration curves in the probability of RHT at 18, 24 and 30 months.


CONCLUSION
This study built a nomogram for RHT in NPC survivors by analyzing both clinical and dose-volume parameters using LASSO. Thus, the individual dose constraint could be achieved in a visual format. Advances in knowledge: This study used LASSO to more accurately address the multicollinear problem between variables. The resulting nomogram will help physicians predict RHT.",2017,The British journal of radiology
"Die Assoziation von Methylâ€, Ã„thylâ€ und nâ€Propylamin in gesÃ¤ttigten aliphatischen Kohlenwasserstoffen (nach Dampfdruckmessungen)","Es werden die Dampfdruckisothermen der Systeme Methylamin-n-Butan, Methylamin-n-Nonan, Athylamin-n-Butan, Athylamin-n-Hexan und n-Propylamin-n-Hexan bei Temperaturen zwischen meist +20 und â€“55 Â°C bestimmt. Uber die aus den gemessenen Isothermen erhaltenen Aktivitatskoeffizienten werden mit Gleichungen von Prigogine und Mitarbeitern sowie mit Beziehungen, die in einer vorausgegangenen Arbeit entwickelt wurden, folgende, die Assoziation der Amine kennzeichnende Grosen berechnet:

3 
Assoziationskonstanten, 
 
4 
Assoziationswarmen sowie 
 
5 
Verdampfungs- und Solvatationswarmen. 
 
 
 
 
 
Aus den berechneten Daten folgt, das die betrachteten Systeme sich bei der Assoziation ahnlich verhalten wie das fruher untersuchte System Methylamin-n-Hexan: Die mittlere Zahligkeit der Aminassoziate ist gering, verglichen mit der mittleren Zahligkeit der Alkoholassoziate unter ahnlichen Bedingungen; die Gleichgewichtskonstanten der unterschiedlichen Assoziationsstufen sind verschieden, die Assoziationswarmen dieser Stufen aber annahernd gleich. 
 
 
 
Daruber hinaus lassen die berechneten Werte erkennen, das die Assoziation mit zunehmender Lange der aliphatischen Kette des Amins zuruckgeht. Hierbei stellen bei Betrachtung im Konzentrationsmas die Kohlenwasserstoffe mit groserer Kettenlange schwachere Verdunnungsmittel als die Kohlenwasserstoffe mit kleinerer Kettenlange dar. 
 
 
 
Schlieslich belegen die ermittelten Daten, das die unspezifische Wechselwirkung zwischen den Aminmolekeln und die Wechselwirkung zwischen Amin- und Kohlenwasserstoffmolekeln nicht sehr verschieden voneinander sein konnen. Dies spricht dafur, das die Anwendung der Prigogineschen Theorie bei den betrachteten Systemen berechtigt ist. 
 
 
 
Vapour pressure isotherms at temperatures mostly between +20 and â€“55 Â°C have been determined for the systems methylamine - n-butane, methylamine - n-nonane, ethylamine - n-butane, ethylamine - n-hexane, and n-propylamine -n-hexane. From the activity coefficients derived from these isotherms we have calculated some quantities relating to association of the amines by the use of equations due to Prigogine and his collaborators and of relations developed in a preceding paper. These quantities are: 
 
1 
mole fractions of monomeric and associated substance, 
 
2 
mean association numbers of complexes, 
 
3 
equilibrium constants for association, 
 
4 
heats of association, 
 
5 
heats of evaporation and solvation. 
 
 
 
 
 
The calculated data indicate a similarity in the association behaviour between these systems and the previously studied system methylamine - n-hexane. The mean association number of the amine complexes is smaller than that of alcohols under similar conditions; the equilibrium constants of the individual association steps are different but the heats of association of these steps are approximately the same. 
 
 
 
The calculations indicate decreasing association with increasing length of the aliphatic chain of the amine. In terms of concentration, hydrocarbons of longer chain length exert a smaller dilution effect than hydrocarbons of shorter chain length. 
 
 
 
The data obtained also indicate that the non-specific interaction between the amine molecules and that between amine and hydrocarbon molecules cannot be very different. This supports the view that the application of Prigogine's theory to the systems considered is justified.",1964,
Operative Therapie der endokrinen Orbitopathie,"Die endokrine Orbitopathie (EO) ist eine schwerwiegende immunologische
Entzundungsreaktion des retroorbitalen Binde-, Fett- und Augenmuskelgewebes. Die EO
tritt nur im Rahmen von Immunthyreopathien auf und bildet deren haufigste
extrathyreoidale Manifestation. Die typischen Symptome der EO sind Folge der
Volumenzunahme des retrobulbaren Binde- und Fettgewebes sowie der interstitiellen
Verdickung der Augenmuskel. Klinisch zeigt sich ein Spektrum von zunehmend
schwerwiegenden Orbitaveranderungen, wie Lid- und Bindehautinfiltration,
Exophthalmus, Muskelverdickung, Hornhautschadigungen und Sehnervbeteiligung mit
Visusabfall. Bei einer Funktionsstorung des Sehnervs (Optikuskompression) stellt die
Orbitadekompression haufig die einzige Chance dar.
Von Januar 1992 bis August 1998 wurden 17 Patienten (34 Orbitae) mit Visusminderung
und verlangerten Latenzzeiten der visuell evozierten Potentiale aus einem Kollektiv von
uber 600 Patienten mit EO chirurgisch behandelt. Alle Gesamtbehandlungsdaten wurden
prospektiv dokumentiert. Die chirurgische Intervention wurde nur in den Fallen
durchgefuhrt, in denen trotz Retrobulbarbestrahlung und hochdosierter
Glukokortikoidtherapie ein progressiver Visusverlust bestand. Die chirurgische Therapie
beinhaltet eine 3-Wand-Dekompression der medialen, inferioren und lateralen
Orbitawande und des Orbitainhalts uber einen bikoronaren und gegebenfalls anterioren

Die Langzeitergebnisse der Patienten zeigen verbesserte oder gleiche Visusverhaltnisse
bei 28 der 34 postoperativ untersuchten Augen. Der Prozes des Visusverlustes konnte
demnach durch die Operation zuverlassog gestoppt werden. Ebenso lies sich der
Exophthalmus signifikant reduzieren. Parameter wie Visus, Exophthalmus, VECP,
Augenmotilitat, Diplopie und Gesichtsfeld wurden pra- und postoperativ dokumentiert.
Postoperative Abweichungen der Bulbusachsen waren nur bedingt vorhersagbar und
wurden durch sekundare Augenmuskelverlagerungen korrigiert. Es zeigten sich keine
nennenswerten Komplikationen. Fur Extremfalle therapieresistenter endokriner

Performing Vulnerability: An Examination of Carson Kreitzer's Lasso of Truth,"It's about trust. I had a wonderful, wide-ranging, hourlong phone interview with Ms. Kreitzer recently, and she kept returning to that phrase. While I'd never before considered trust as a Kreitzerian theme, the more I ruminated upon it, the more powerful the idea became.To understand the positioning of trust within Lasso of Truth, it is instructive to look briefly at Kreitzer's earlier works. In her Women Who Kill triptych-Heroin/e (Keep Us Quiet); Valerie Shoots Andy; and Self Defense, or death of some salesmen-trust is shattered to such a degree that it results in murder. Whether it is Valerie Solanas' conviction that she was betrayed by Andy Warhol in Valerie Shoots Andy, or Aileen Wuornos' claim that the murders she committed were an inevitable result of the violence visited upon her when she was a prostitute in Self Defense-that she was simply defending herself from future violence-we return to the issue of betrayal of trust, whether that is trust in another person or the social compact. In Kreitzer's 1:23, which examines cases of infanticide, she addresses the most fundamental trust in the world-that your mother will protect you and keep you safe.Lasso of Truth posits a number of situations where, while trust is damaged or even broken, it is not shattered beyond repair. As well, the offending party feels remorse for what has been wrought. The authorial choice to engage with issues of trust and vulnerability in a more nuanced manner than in the works mentioned above results in Lasso of Truth being a deeper, more layered, and ultimately more resonant work than anything Kreitzer has previously written. The work, ostensibly about Wonder Woman, has as its dominant plot the adult life of William Moulton Marston, the creator of Wonder Woman and inventor of the lie detector test. In addition to his work as an inventor and author, Marston is also a practitioner of BDSM, specifically bondage.This disturbs The Girl, who says, ""Sometimes you find something out that shifts your entire perspective. Makes you re-consider previously solid, immutable facts. A Betrayal... of your entire world-view. Like finding out that the hero of my childhood, my role model, Wonder Woman was written by a Bondage Perv."" As heartfelt as this reaction is, it's a misreading. Marston's exploration of bondage was part of a larger interest in Female Dominance. The state of vulnerability created when a man is placed in rope bondage by a woman is reenacted in Wonder Woman's use of her Lasso of Truth.To willingly submit to bondage requires two qualities: a desire to be controlled, and therefore vulnerable; and an enormous amount of trust. Marston's predilection for being bound by women, his belief that women are the superior sex, is reflected in and amplified by his creation of Wonder Woman. Kreitzer's work often mirrors actual events, and in the script, as in Marston's real life, he is in a loving menage a trois. In Lasso of Truth the characters are called The Wife and The Amazon-their real-world counterparts are Elizabeth Holloway Marston and Olive Byrne. Although the Marston figure is in many ways the most submissive of the three, it was his insistence that there be no secrets whatsoever that allowed the triad to thrive. Notably, although the three at first attempt to share all experiences equally, The Wife refuses to be bound.Eventually, as The Wife and The Amazon grow closer, she allows The Amazon to bind her. It is the combination of the fact that The Wife took a risk with The Amazon she was unable to take with him, the fact she had an experience he did not share, the inference through this sharing that The Wife and The Amazon were closer to each other than either was to him, the omission of the event within their daily conversation, the lie that was inscribed within this omission, and the resultant shattering of the two ideals that he held most dear, those of truth and trust, that enraged Marston (here called The Inventor. â€¦",2017,
Regularization with the Smooth-Lasso procedure,"We consider the linear regression problem. We propose the S-Lasso procedure to estimate the unknown regression parameters. This estimator enjoys sparsity of the representation while taking into account correlation between successive covariates (or predictors). The study covers the case when $p\gg n$, i.e. the number of covariates is much larger than the number of observations. In the theoretical point of view, for fixed $p$, we establish asymptotic normality and consistency in variable selection results for our procedure. When $p\geq n$, we provide variable selection consistency results and show that the S-Lasso achieved a Sparsity Inequality, i.e., a bound in term of the number of non-zero components of the oracle vector. It appears that the S-Lasso has nice variable selection properties compared to its challengers. Furthermore, we provide an estimator of the effective degree of freedom of the S-Lasso estimator. A simulation study shows that the S-Lasso performs better than the Lasso as far as variable selection is concerned especially when high correlations between successive covariates exist. This procedure also appears to be a good challenger to the Elastic-Net (Zou and Hastie, 2005).",2008,arXiv: Statistics Theory

Feature Grouping Using Weighted l1 Norm for High-Dimensional Data,"Building effective predictive models from high-dimensional data is an important problem in several domains such as in bioinformatics, healthcare analytics and general regression analysis. Extracting feature groups automatically from such data with several correlated features is necessary, in order to use regularizers such as the group lasso which can exploit this deciphered grouping structure to build effective prediction models. Elastic net, fused-lasso and Octagonal Shrinkage Clustering Algorithm for Regression (oscar) are some of the popular feature grouping methods proposed in the literature which recover both sparsity and feature groups from the data. However, their predictive ability is affected adversely when the regression coefficients of adjacent feature groups are similar, but not exactly equal. This happens as these methods merge such adjacent feature groups erroneously, which is also called the misfusion problem. In order to solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a weighted l1 norm-based approach which is effective at recovering feature groups, despite the proximity of the coefficients of adjacent feature groups, building extremely accurate predictive models. This convex optimization problem is solved using the fast iterative soft-thresholding algorithm (FISTA). We depict how our approach is more effective at resolving the misfusion problem on synthetic datasets compared to existing feature grouping methods such as the elastic net, fused-lasso and oscar. We also evaluate the goodness of the model on real-world breast cancer gene expression and the 20-Newsgroups datasets.",2016,2016 IEEE 16th International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM)
A DNA-based demonstration of a three-host life-cycle for the Bivesiculidae (Platyhelminthes: Digenea),"Immature bivesiculid trematodes collected from the intestine of Thlalassoma lunare (Labridae) are shown to be morphologically consistent with adults of Bivesicula claviformis from Epinephelus fasciatus (Serranidae). In addition, the immature bivesiculids have the same sequence for the second internal transcribed spacer of the ribosomal DNA. Comparison with three other species of Bivesiculidae showed differences of between 23% and 30%. These results show that bivesiculids may have three-host life-cycles in addition to the two-host life-cycles that have been demonstrated previously. The three-host life-cycle enables bivesiculids to infect large carnivorous fishes.",1998,International journal for parasitology
Sparse Recovery via l1 and L1 Optimization,"Abstract : A sparse signal is a signal that has very few nonzero elements or one that becomes so under a basis change or through a certain transform. Exploiting sparsity has become a common task in data sciences. Compressed sensing, regularized regression (e.g., LASSO), and regularized inverse problems (e.g., total variation image reconstruction) have made l1 optimization a central tool in data processing problems. As the name suggests, l1 optimization problems recover sparse solutions by solving an optimization problem involving an l1-norm. Today, the scope of l1 optimization is quickly expanding. The size, complexity, and diversity of instances have grown significantly. Beyond 1D signals and 2D images, high-dimensional quantities such as video, 4D CT, and multi-way tensors have become the data or unknown variables in models. New applications have motivated structured solutions to optimization problems that significantly generalize our notion of sparsity. Such applications look for low-rank matrices or tensors, sparse graphs, tree structured data representations, and sparse representations involving only a few dictionary atoms. This article gives self-contained introductions to l1 optimization for sparse vectors (Section 2), L1 optimization for finding functions with compact support (Section 3), and computing sparse solutions from measurements that are corrupted by unknown noisy (Section 4).",2014,
Preoperative radiomic signature based on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging for noninvasive evaluation of biological characteristics in rectal cancer,"AbstractObjectivesTo develop and validate radiomic models in evaluating biological characteristics of rectal cancer based on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MP-MRI).MethodsThis study consisted of 345 patients with rectal cancer who underwent MP-MRI. We focused on evaluating five postoperative confirmed characteristics: lymph node (LN) metastasis, tumor differentiation, fraction of Ki-67-positive tumor cells, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), and KRAS-2 gene mutation status. Data from 197 patients were used to develop the biological characteristics evaluation models. Radiomic features were extracted from MP-MRI and then refined for reproducibility and redundancy. The refined features were investigated for usefulness in building radiomic signatures by using two feature-ranking methods (MRMR and WLCX) and three classifiers (RF, SVM, and LASSO). Multivariable logistic regression was used to build an integrated evaluation model combining radiomic signatures and clinical characteristics. The performance was evaluated using an independent validation dataset comprising 148 patients.ResultsThe MRMR and LASSO regression produced the best-performing radiomic signatures for evaluating HER-2, LN metastasis, tumor differentiation, and KRAS-2 gene status, with AUC values of 0.696 (95% CI, 0.610â€“0.782), 0.677 (95% CI, 0.591â€“0.763), 0.720 (95% CI, 0.621â€“0.819), and 0.651 (95% CI, 0.539â€“0.763), respectively. The best-performing signatures for evaluating Ki-67 produced an AUC value of 0.699 (95% CI, 0.611â€“0.786), and it was developed by WLCX and RF algorithm. The integrated evaluation model incorporating radiomic signature and MRI-reported LN status had improved AUC of 0.697 (95% CI, 0.612â€“0.781).ConclusionRadiomic signatures based on MP-MRI have potential to noninvasively evaluate the biological characteristics of rectal cancer.Key Pointsâ€¢ Radiomic features were extracted from MP-MRI images of the rectal tumor.
 â€¢ The proposed radiomic signatures demonstrated discrimination ability in identifying the histopathological, immunohistochemical, and genetic characteristics of rectal cancer.â€¢ All MRI sequences were important and could provide complementary information in radiomic analysis.",2018,European Radiology
Efficient estimation and variable selection for infinite variance autoregressive models,"In this paper, a self-weighted composite quantile regression estimation procedure is developed to estimate unknown parameter in an infinite variance autoregressive (IVAR) model. The proposed estimator is asymptotically normal and more efficient than a single quantile regression estimator. At the same time, the adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) for variable selection are also suggested. We show that the adaptive LASSO based on the self-weighted composite quantile regression enjoys the oracle properties. Simulation studies and a real data example are conducted to examine the performance of the proposed approaches.",2012,Journal of Applied Mathematics and Computing
Generalized LASSO with under-determined regularization matrices,"This paper studies the intrinsic connection between a generalized LASSO and a basic LASSO formulation. The former is the extended version of the latter by introducing a regularization matrix to the coefficients. We show that when the regularization matrix is even- or under-determined with full rank conditions, the generalized LASSO can be transformed into the LASSO form via the Lagrangian framework. In addition, we show that some published results of LASSO can be extended to the generalized LASSO, and some variants of LASSO, e.g., robust LASSO, can be rewritten into the generalized LASSO form and hence can be transformed into basic LASSO. Based on this connection, many existing results concerning LASSO, e.g., efficient LASSO solvers, can be used for generalized LASSO.",2016,Signal processing
Phylogenic relationship of Labridae species deduced from comparative dissection.,"Labridae is a family of shallow-water coastal fish that belong to the Labroidei suborder in the Perciformes order. There has however been little comparative dissection or phylogenetic research on this family, which resulted in confusion regarding species classification. Therefore morphological characters of 12 species of Labridae containing three subfamilies and seven genera were compared for the purpose of determining the characteristics of the subfamilies and genera of Labridae and deducing their phylogenic relationship. We compiled a phylogenetic tree by using the computer program PAUP 4.0b10 and a data set composed of 17 meristic and osteological characters. In our phylogenic tree, the two species of Bodianinae, three species of Cheilininae and seven species of Corinae each formed monophyletic groups, supporting the conventional classification by lateral line shape. Furthermore, the group of three species of Cheilininae and the group of two species of Bodianinae were shown to be more closely related, because they have several common morphological characteristics, such as neuroarticular processes and anterior teeth on premaxilla. Between seven species of Corinae, not only was the group of two species of Halichoeres more closely related to Coris dorsomacula, but also, this group of three species may be closely related to the three species of Thalassoma. Suezichthys gracilis was also found to have separated from the other Corinae species at the earliest stage.",2013,Anatomical record

Podocarpus from the Upper Cretaceous of Eastern Asia and its bearing on the theory of conifer evolution,"Podocarpus tzagajanicus sp. nov. from the Uppermost Cretaceous (Tzagajan beds) of the Bureja River augments the Mesozoic record of the northern hemisphere Podocarpaceae. 'Northern' and 'southern' conifers grew side by side in Mesozoic and Tertiary forests. The distribution of conifers has been more deeply affected by climatic changes than by continental drift. IN a review of the Cambridge symposium on the biogeographical aspects of continental drift, Jardine and McKenzie (1972) quoted among selected examples Florin's theory of conifer distribution. They claimed (p. 24) that 'the history of the conifers provides another striking example of the action of drifting continents as agents of dispersal. Florin showed that from the Late Carboniferous (about 300 my) to the early Eocene (about 50 my) each of the conifer genera (with the exception of Araucaria) had either a ""Gondwana"" distribution . . . or ""Laurasian"" distribution. . . . The present disjunct distribution of Podocarpus and other Gondwana genera may be the product of the break-up of Gondwanaland, and the Tertiary spread of them into Indonesia and Southeast Asia may result from the northward drift of Australia.' Such views on the history of conifers are widely accepted. Rudolf Florin, an outstanding palaeobotanist and a great authority on gymnosperm taxonomy, came to his ideas of conifer evolution when describing Tertiary conifers from Chile (Florin 1940). He held then that both lineages of conifers, northern and southern, had been perfectly separated through time and space. Paranocladus, Walkomiella, Buriadia, Araucariaceae, Podocarpaceae, and Athrotaxis constituted the main body of the southern group and the rest of the conifers the northern one. Twenty years later Florin (1963) reiterated his views. The only exception made was for the Araucariaceae (but not for the genus Araucaria) which had been recorded from several northern localities. The works of R. Krausel on fossil woods and of R. A. Couper on microfossils provided additional evidence in favour of Florin's theory. Although several authors (Buchholz 1948; Ferguson 1967; Krassilov 1967, 1971) objected to this theory, it became fairly popular among botanists and earth scientists and was cited in many textbooks (e.g. Stebbins 1967). In recent years it has been used as a confirmation of continental drift. It is worth mentioning that Florin himself opposed the drift theory and relied upon 'continental bridges' as pathways of conifer distribution. The 'southern' palaeozoic conifer Walkomiella is hardly distinguishable from the 'northern' Lebachia. The early Triassic northern family Voltziaceae was represented in the southern hemisphere by the genus Voltziopsis. Other Mesozoic families such as Cycadocarpidiaceae and Cheirolepidiaceae were also distributed in both northern and [Palaeontology, Vol. 17, Part 2, 1974, pp. 365-370, pi. 49.] 366 PALAEONTOLOGY, VOLUME 17 southern continents. Cycadocarpidium has been recorded from the Upper Triassic of Argentina and the generic name Tomaxellia was recently proposed by Archangelsky (1968) for a southern cheirolepidiaceous conifer with pollen grains of Classopollis-type. He also suggested the cheirolepidiaceous affinities of Patagonian Jurassic conifer Pararaucaria, as well as Indostrobus from the Cretaceous of India. The 'southern' taxodiaceous genus Athrotaxis (or its nearest approach Athrotaxites) has been repeatedly recorded from the Lower Cretaceous of Canada and U.S.S.R. (Bell 1956; Krassilov 1967). All the above-listed facts contradict the division of ancient conifers into Gondwanian and Laurasian groups. But even more important is the evidence of the Laurasian distribution of Mesozoic Podocarpaceae. Pollen grains of the podocarpaceous type are known from many northern localities. However, most of them have been recently attributed to artificial genera. I referred to Podocarpaceae several megafossils from the Lower Cretaceous of the Primorye (near Vladivostok, Far East of the U.S.S.R.). One of them, Podocarpus sujfunensis Krassilov, displays the characters of the Nageia section of the genus Podocarpus (Krassilov 1967). The leaves are 120 mm long and 2-2 mm broad, with numerous veins, amphistomatic. Stomata all over the surface in longitudinal files separated by several cell files, amphicyclic; the polar encircling cells shared by adjacent stomata or absent; subsidiary cells papillate. Another species, Podocarpus harrisii Krassilov has linear-lanceolate, shortly petiolate, single veined, hypostomatic leaves about 40 mm long and 4-6 mm wide. The abaxial epidermis with broad central stomatic band is occasionally divided into two or three parts by narrow and irregular nonstomatiferous zones. Stomata arranged in files, longitudinally orientated, amphicyclic; subsidiary cells papillate. The topography of the abaxial epidermis is rather unusual for conifers, with flat single-veined leaves. However, several living species of the subgenus Stachycarpus show stomata over the vein. The division of stomatic bands into 'Teilstreifen' is also known among Stachycarpus species (Florin 1931). Bilaterally flattened leaves have been recorded from the Lower Cretaceous of Primorye under the name Paracmopyle florinii Krassilov. Primorye certainly was not the only Laurasian territory where Podocarpaceae flourished during Mesozoic time. Gomolitzky (1962) described leaves with podocarpaceous cuticle characters from the Jurassic of Central Asia. The fossil wood Podocarpoxylon triassicum has been found in the Keuper of Central Europe (Selmier and Vogellehner 1968). I suggested the podocarpaceous affinity of the Wealden species Tritaenia (Abietites) linkii (Roem.) Magdefrau and Rudolf as evidenced by stomata organization and topography of abaxial epidermis with three Teilstreifen' (Krassilov 1967, 1971). Podocarpus tzagajanicus sp. nov. from the uppermost Cretaceous of the Amurland augments the record of Mesozoic podocarps. As far as I know it is the only Late Cretaceous representative of the family.

Differential MicroRNA Signatures in the Pathogenesis of Barrett's Esophagus,"OBJECTIVES
Barrett's esophagus (BE) is the precursor lesion and a major risk factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). Although patients with BE undergo routine endoscopic surveillance, current screening methodologies have proven ineffective at identifying individuals at risk of EAC. Since microRNAs (miRNAs) have potential diagnostic and prognostic value as disease biomarkers, we sought to identify an miRNA signature of BE and EAC.


METHODS
High-throughput sequencing of miRNAs was performed on serum and tissue biopsies from 31 patients identified either as normal, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), BE, BE with low-grade dysplasia (LGD), or EAC. Logistic regression modeling of miRNA profiles with Lasso regularization was used to identify discriminating miRNA. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to validate changes in miRNA expression using 46 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens obtained from normal, GERD, BE, BE with LGD or HGD, and EAC subjects.


RESULTS
A 3-class predictive model was able to classify tissue samples into normal, GERD/BE, or LGD/EAC classes with an accuracy of 80%. Sixteen miRNAs were identified that predicted 1 of the 3 classes. Our analysis confirmed previous reports indicating that miR-29c-3p and miR-193b-5p expressions are altered in BE and EAC and identified miR-4485-5p as a novel biomarker of esophageal dysplasia. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction validated 11 of 16 discriminating miRNAs.


DISCUSSION
Our data provide an miRNA signature of normal, precancerous, and cancerous tissue that may stratify patients at risk of progressing to EAC. We found that serum miRNAs have a limited ability to distinguish between disease states, thus limiting their potential utility in early disease detection.",2020,Clinical and Translational Gastroenterology
Development and Validation of a Diagnostic Nomogram to Predict COVID-19 Pneumonia,"Background: The COVID-19 virus is an emerging virus rapidly spread worldwide This study aimed to establish an effective diagnostic nomogram for suspected COVID-19 pneumonia patients. METHODS: We used the LASSO aggression and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the predictive factors associated with COVID-19 pneumonia, and established the diagnostic nomogram for COVID-19 pneumonia using multivariable regression. This diagnostic nomogram was assessed by the internal and external validation data set. Further, we plotted decision curves and clinical impact curve to evaluate the clinical usefulness of this diagnostic nomogram. RESULTS: The predictive factors including the epidemiological history, wedge-shaped or fan-shaped lesion parallel to or near the pleura, bilateral lower lobes, ground glass opacities, crazy paving pattern and white blood cell (WBC) count were contained in the nomogram. In the primary cohort, the C-statistic for predicting the probability of the COVID-19 pneumonia was 0.967, even higher than the C-statistic (0.961) in initial viral nucleic acid nomogram which was established using the univariable regression. The C-statistic was 0.848 in external validation cohort. Good calibration curves were observed for the prediction probability in the internal validation and external validation cohort.

The role of extreme iteroparity and risk avoidance in the evolution of mating systems,"How much should a female be willing to risk in any one reproductive event? Highly iteroparous females will be risk averse and very conservative in their behaviour. Such females will be expected to avoid mortality risks and seek assurance that any current reproductive activity is safe. By way of minimizing risk, these same females will not engage in mate assessment or mate searching to the same degree as less iteroparous species, if these activities involve increased risk of mortality. Using a field experiment in a highly iteroparous species (the bluehead wrasse, Thalassoma bifasciatum), it is shown that females in this species are indeed relatively risk averse. More importantly, the experiment also shows that individuals vary in their risk aversion depending on local population size, in a manner predicted from life-history theory. Then it is reviewed how several important aspects of the mating system in this species are best interpreted as results of conservative, risk-averse female behaviour. Finally, these ideas are generalized to suggest how basic aspects of the mating system might differ between species with many reproductive events over the lifetime (e.g. many tropical reef fishes) v. species with few reproductive opportunities (e.g. many temperate freshwater and marine fishes).",1998,Journal of Fish Biology
On selecting interacting features from high-dimensional data,"For high-dimensional data, most feature-selection methods, such as SIS and the lasso, involve ranking and selecting features individually. These methods do not require many computational resources, but they ignore feature interactions. A simple recursive approach, which, without requiring many more computational resources, also allows identification of interactions, is investigated. This approach can lead to substantial improvements in the performance of classifiers, and can provide insight into the way in which features work together in a given population. It also enjoys attractive statistical properties.",2014,Comput. Stat. Data Anal.
Variable Selection Incorporating Prior Constraint Information into Lasso,"We propose the variable selection procedure incorporating prior constraint information into lasso. The proposed procedure combines the sample and prior information, and selects significant variables for responses in a narrower region where the true parameters lie. It increases the efficiency to choose the true model correctly. The proposed procedure can be executed by many constrained quadratic programming methods and the initial estimator can be found by least square or Monte Carlo method. The proposed procedure also enjoys good theoretical properties. Moreover, the proposed procedure is not only used for linear models but also can be used for generalized linear models({\sl GLM}), Cox models, quantile regression models and many others with the help of Wang and Leng (2007)'s LSA, which changes these models as the approximation of linear models. The idea of combining sample and prior constraint information can be also used for other modified lasso procedures. Some examples are used for illustration of the idea of incorporating prior constraint information in variable selection procedures.",2007,arXiv: Methodology

Sensitivity to prior specification in Bayesian genome-based prediction models,"Abstract Different statistical models have been proposed for maximizing prediction accuracy in genome-based prediction of breeding values in plant and animal breeding. However, little is known about the sensitivity of these models with respect to prior and hyperparameter specification, because comparisons of prediction performance are mainly based on a single set of hyperparameters. In this study, we focused on Bayesian prediction methods using a standard linear regression model with marker covariates coding additive effects at a large number of marker loci. By comparing different hyperparameter settings, we investigated the sensitivity of four methods frequently used in genome-based prediction (Bayesian Ridge, Bayesian Lasso, BayesA and BayesB) to specification of the prior distribution of marker effects. We used datasets simulated according to a typical maize breeding program differing in the number of markers and the number of simulated quantitative trait loci affecting the trait. Furthermore, we used an experimental maize dataset, comprising 698 doubled haploid lines, each genotyped with 56110 single nucleotide polymorphism markers and phenotyped as testcrosses for the two quantitative traits grain dry matter yield and grain dry matter content. The predictive ability of the different models was assessed by five-fold cross-validation. The extent of Bayesian learning was quantified by calculation of the Hellinger distance between the prior and posterior densities of marker effects. Our results indicate that similar predictive abilities can be achieved with all methods, but with BayesA and BayesB hyperparameter settings had a stronger effect on prediction performance than with the other two methods. Prediction performance of BayesA and BayesB suffered substantially from a non-optimal choice of hyperparameters.",2013,
"Thalassococcus lentus sp. nov., an alphaproteobacterium isolated from seawater of a seaweed farm","A Gram-negative, non-motile and rod- or ovoid-shaped bacterial strain, designated YCS-24T, was isolated from seawater of a seaweed farm in the South Sea, South Korea. Strain YCS-24T grew optimally at 25â€“28Â Â°C, at pH 7.0â€“7.5 and in the presence of 2Â % (w/v) NaCl. Strain YCS-24T exhibited the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity values of 97.5 and 97.1Â % to the type strains of Thalassobiusmaritimus and Thalassococcushalodurans, respectively. The neighbour-joining, maximum-likelihood and maximum-parsimony phylogenetic trees based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain YCS-24T clustered with the type strain of T. halodurans. The DNA G+C content of strain YCS-24T was 58.0Â mol% and its DNAâ€“DNA relatedness values with T. halodurans JCM 13833T and T. maritimus GSW-M6T were 17Â Â±Â 6.2 and 23Â Â±Â 9.2Â %, respectively. The predominant ubiquinone found in strain YCS-24T was Q-10 and the predominant fatty acid of strain YCS-24T was C18:1Ï‰7c. The major polar lipids of strain YCS-24T were phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylglycerol, one unidentified aminolipid and one unidentified lipid. Differential phenotypic properties, together with the phylogenetic and genetic distinctiveness, demonstrated that strain YCS-24T is distinguished from T. halodurans. On the basis of the data presented, strain YCS-24T (=Â KCTC 32084TÂ =Â CCUG 62791T) represents a novel species of the genus Thalassococcus, for which the name Thalassococcuslentus sp. nov. is proposed.",2012,Antonie van Leeuwenhoek

A Homotopy Algorithm for the Quantile Regression Lasso and Related Piecewise Linear Problems,"We show that the homotopy algorithm of Osborne, Presnell, and Turlach (2000), which has proved such an effective optimal path following method for implementing Tibshiraniâ€™s â€œlassoâ€ for variable selection in least squares estimation problems, can be extended to polyhedral objectives in examples such as the quantile regression lasso. The new algorithm introduces the novel feature that it requires two homotopy sequences involving continuation steps with respect to both the constraint bound and the Lagrange multiplier to be performed consecutively. Performance is illustrated by application to several standard datasets, and these results are compared to calculations made with the original lasso homotopy program. This permits an assessment of the computational complexity to be made both for the new method and for the closely related linear programming post-optimality procedures as these generate essentially identical solution trajectories. This comparison strongly favors the least squares selection method. Howe...",2011,Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics
"ISOcat and RELcat, two cooperating semantic registries","In ISOcat, a data category registry, metadata and linguistic concepts are defined. In order to prevent a proliferation of entries, the components of a complex tag are defined, not the full tags themselves. I.e., instead of one definition for a CGN-tag like /VG(neven)/, definitions for its components /conjunction/ (VG) and /coordinate/ (neven) are entered, the profit clearly being avoidance of definitions for more complex tags, like /N(soort,ev,basis,zijd,stan)/, one of the representations of a 'soortnaam' (common noun). After all, many (most?) of these fine-grained tags are unlikely to be reuseable in other languages. But having broken up these tags, we nevertheless want to be able to relate our components /conjunction/ and /coordinate/ with entries like /coordinate conjunction/ or /coordinating conjunction/, or /noun/ and /common/ with /common noun/. This can be done in RELcat, in which ontological relations, like sameAs, almostSameAs, partOf, superclassof, can be defined. Thus far, this has been done for one-to-one relationships. For CGN, more complex instantiations are needed. First, the relevant CGN-components are to be combined, and next, this combination is to be related to another ISOcat concept. And what about the full tags? Are they entailed in the relation as well? In this presentation we will answer these questions and show how different granularity levels can be tackled to enable the possibilities for semantic crosswalks.",2014,
Complex Lasso: New Entangled Motifs in Proteins,"We identify new entangled motifs in proteins that we call complex lassos. Lasso arise in proteins with disulphide bridges (or in proteins with amide linkages), when termini of a protein backbone pierces through an auxiliary surface of minimal area, spanned on a covalent loop. We found that as much as 18% of all proteins with disulphide bridges in a non-redunant subset of PDB form complex lassos, and classify them into five distinct geometric classes. Based on biological classification of proteins we found that lassos are much more common in viruses, plants and fungi than in other kingdoms of life. We also discuss possible functions of lassos. Lassos and associated surfaces of minimal area provide new, interesting and possessing many potential applications geometric characteristics not only of proteins, but also of other biomolecules.",2016,Biophysical Journal
Assessment of the Management of Postoperative Pain in the Surgery Department of Souro Sanou University Hospital Center in Bobo-Dioulasso,"Introduction: Postoperative pain is a component of the surgical procedure. Its care is poorly documented in Burkina Faso. Goal: To evaluate the management of the postoperative pain in the surgical departments of Souro Sanou University Hospital Center in BoboDioulasso. Methodology: Itâ€™s a prospective study, transverse type referred to descriptive, covering the period from January 1st to 31st March 2017. It focused on surgical patients, aged at least 15 years old and having been hospitalized for at least 24 hours after their surgery. Results: A total of 124 patients were included in the study . The average age was 42, 65 years old with a sex ratio of 1.82. The majority of patients (52.42%) did not attend school. According to the anesthetic risk, the patients were classified as ASA1 (62.90%); ASA II or ASA III (37.1%). The types of surgery performed were: orthopedic in 36 cases (29.03%); visceral in 40 cases (20.16%); urogenital in 29 cases (23.39%); maxillofacial in 12 cases (9.68%); ENT in 7 cases (5.65%). The frequency of the postoperative pain was 88.71%. The average pain intensity at EVA was 42.73 mm. The anesthetic technique was a general anesthesia in 66.94% and a loco regional in 33.06%. Postoperatively, multimodal analgesia was prescribed in 44.35%. Patients were satisfied with the management of their postoperative pain in 52.42%, against 22.58% unsatisfied. Conclusion: The management of postoperative pain remains insufficient in the surgical departments. Improving the quality of care requires setting up care protocols, training staff and carrying out audits on professional practices.",2018,
"Arts of Inclusion, or How to Love a Mushroom","Next time you walk through a forest, look down. A city lies under your feet. If you were somehow to descend into the earth, you would find yourself surrounded by the cityâ€™s architecture of webs and filaments. Fungi make those webs as they interact with the roots of trees, forming joint structures of fungus and root called â€˜mycorrhizaâ€™. Mycorrhizal webs connect not just root and fungus, but, by way of fungal filaments, tree and tree, connecting up the forest in entanglements. This city is a lively scene of action and interaction. There are many ways to eat here and to share food. There is recognizable hunting in the city: for example, some fungi lasso little soil worms called nematodes for dinner. But this is just the crudest way to attune oneâ€™s digestion. Mycorrhizal fungi siphon energy-giving sugars from trees for their use. Some of those sugars are re-distributed through the fungal network from tree to tree. Others support dependent plants, such as mushroom-loving â€˜mycophilesâ€™ that tap the network to send out pale or colourful stems of flowers (e.g., Indian pipes, coral-root orchids). Meanwhile, like an inside-out stomach, fungi secrete enzymes into the soil around them, digesting organic material and even rocks, and absorbing nutrients released in the process. These nutrients are also available then for the trees and other plants, which use them to produce more sugar for themselvesâ€” and the network. In this process, too, there is a whole lot of smelling going on, as plants and animals and fungi sniff out not just good meals but also good partners. And what wonderful smells, even for an animal nose, like mine. (Some fungi, such as truffles, depend on animals to smell out their reproductive bodies, to spread around their spores.) Reach down and smell a clot of forest earth: it smells like the underground city of fungi.1",2010,Manoa
Transformations of Data in Deterministic Modelling of Biological Networks,"The Gaussian graphical model (GGM) is a probabilistic modelling approach used in the system biology to represent the relationship between genes with an undirected graph. In graphical models, the genes and their interactions are denoted by nodes and the edges between nodes. Hereby, in this model, it is assumed that the structure of the system can be described by the inverse of the covariance matrix, \(\varTheta \), which is also called as the precision, when the observations are formulated via a lasso regression under the multivariate normality assumption of states. There are several approaches to estimate \(\varTheta \) in GGM. The most well-known ones are the neighborhood selection algorithm and the graphical lasso (glasso) approach. On the other hand, the multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) is a non-parametric regression technique to model nonlinear and highly dependent data successfully. From previous simulation studies, it has been found that MARS can be a strong alternative of GGM if the model is constructed similar to a lasso model and the interaction terms in the optimal model are ignored to get comparable results with respect to the GGM findings. Moreover, it has been detected that the major challenge in both modelling approaches is the high sparsity of \(\varTheta \) due to the possible non-linear interactions between genes, in particular, when the dimensions of the networks are realistically large. In this study, as the novelty, we suggest the Bernstein operators, namely, Bernstein and Szasz polynomials, in the raw data before any lasso type of modelling and associated inference approaches. Because from the findings via GGM with small and moderately large systems, we have observed that the Bernstein polynomials can increase the accuracy of the estimates. Hence, in this work, we perform these operators firstly into the most well-known inference approaches used in GGM under realistically large networks. Then, we investigate the assessment of these transformations for the MARS modelling as the alternative of GGM again under the same large complexity. By this way, we aim to propose these transformation techniques for all sorts of modellings under the steady-state condition of the protein-protein interaction networks in order to get more accurate estimates without any computational cost. In the evaluation of the results, we compare the precision and F-measures of the simulated datasets.",2016,
Building interpretable predictive models for pediatric hospital readmission using Tree-Lasso logistic regression,"OBJECTIVES
Quantification and early identification of unplanned readmission risk have the potential to improve the quality of care during hospitalization and after discharge. However, high dimensionality, sparsity, and class imbalance of electronic health data and the complexity of risk quantification, challenge the development of accurate predictive models. Predictive models require a certain level of interpretability in order to be applicable in real settings and create actionable insights. This paper aims to develop accurate and interpretable predictive models for readmission in a general pediatric patient population, by integrating a data-driven model (sparse logistic regression) and domain knowledge based on the international classification of diseases 9th-revision clinical modification (ICD-9-CM) hierarchy of diseases. Additionally, we propose a way to quantify the interpretability of a model and inspect the stability of alternative solutions.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
The analysis was conducted on >66,000 pediatric hospital discharge records from California, State Inpatient Databases, Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project between 2009 and 2011. We incorporated domain knowledge based on the ICD-9-CM hierarchy in a data driven, Tree-Lasso regularized logistic regression model, providing the framework for model interpretation. This approach was compared with traditional Lasso logistic regression resulting in models that are easier to interpret by fewer high-level diagnoses, with comparable prediction accuracy.


RESULTS
The results revealed that the use of a Tree-Lasso model was as competitive in terms of accuracy (measured by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve-AUC) as the traditional Lasso logistic regression, but integration with the ICD-9-CM hierarchy of diseases provided more interpretable models in terms of high-level diagnoses. Additionally, interpretations of models are in accordance with existing medical understanding of pediatric readmission. Best performing models have similar performances reaching AUC values 0.783 and 0.779 for traditional Lasso and Tree-Lasso, respectfully. However, information loss of Lasso models is 0.35 bits higher compared to Tree-Lasso model.


CONCLUSIONS
We propose a method for building predictive models applicable for the detection of readmission risk based on Electronic Health records. Integration of domain knowledge (in the form of ICD-9-CM taxonomy) and a data-driven, sparse predictive algorithm (Tree-Lasso Logistic Regression) resulted in an increase of interpretability of the resulting model. The models are interpreted for the readmission prediction problem in general pediatric population in California, as well as several important subpopulations, and the interpretations of models comply with existing medical understanding of pediatric readmission. Finally, quantitative assessment of the interpretability of the models is given, that is beyond simple counts of selected low-level features.",2016,Artificial intelligence in medicine
[Effects of malaria outbreak in a quarter of the city of Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina Faso)].,"Weekly malaria attack incidence rate has been studied from June to September 1993 in a cluster of children and adults living in a quarter of the city of Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina Faso). The city is located in the savanna area with an average of 1000 mm rainfall in five months. In this recently built quarter at the outskirts, yearly average malaria transmission was of four infected bites mainly due to Anopheles gambiae. The medical team visited each week each included family (28 families, 290 persons). Malaria attack has been defined as a fever attack or the certitude of fever during the hours before, with clinical malaria-related signs, a patent parasitaemia and the lack of obvious other etiology. Parasitic density threshold of 2000 PRBC/mm3 for the children and adolescents, till 16 years old and of 1,000 PRBC/mm3 for the adults, have been utilized for the definition of unquestionable malaria attack. 4128 medical observations have been done. 17 unquestionable malaria attacks have been observed in infants, children and adults with parasitic densities from 40,000 to 720,000 PRBC/mm3. 18 likely attacks were also observed with clinical signs but low density of Plasmodium. All were induced by P. falciparum. From June to the end of July the weekly incidence rate was five for one thousand and from August twelve for one thousand. In a place with a low transmission, the success of an infection is higher than in places with an intense transmission.

Adaptive LASSO for linear regression models with ARMA-GARCH errors,"ABSTRACT The linear regression models with the autoregressive moving average (ARMA) errors (REGARMA models) are often considered, in order to reflect a serial correlation among observations. In this article, we focus on an adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) (ALASSO) method for the variable selection of the REGARMA models and extend it to the linear regression models with the ARMA-generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARMA-GARCH) errors (REGARMA-GARCH models). This attempt is an extension of the existing ALASSO method for the linear regression models with the AR errors (REGAR models) proposed by Wang et al. in 2007. New ALASSO algorithms are proposed to determine important predictors for the REGARMA and REGARMA-GARCH models.

Variable Ranking by Solution-path Algorithms,"Variable Selection has always been a very important problem in statistics. We often meet situations where a huge data set is given and we want to find out the relationship between the response and the corresponding variables. With a huge number of variables, we often end up with a big model even if we delete those that are insignificant. There are two reasons why we are unsatisfied with a final model with too many variables[4]. The first reason is the prediction accuracy. Though the prediction bias might be small under a big model, the variance is usually very high. The second reason is interpretation. With a large number of variables in the model, itâ€™s hard to determine a clear relationship and explain the effects of variables we are interested in. A lot of variable selection methods have been proposed, such as Forwardand BackwardStepwise Selection, Forward-Stagewise Regression, shrinkage methods like Ridge Regression, Lasso and Least Angle Regression. However, one disadvantage of variable selection is that different sizes of model require different tuning parameters in the analysis, which is hard to choose for non-statisticians. Xin and Zhu [8] advocate variable ranking instead of variable selection. Once variables are ranked properly, we can make the selection by adopting a threshold rule. One possible variable ranking can be constructed using Random Forest, which gives two different variable importance measures. We can use either one to get a ranking and usually they lead to similar results. In this thesis, we try to rank the variables using Least Angle Regression (LARS). Some shrinkage methods like Lasso and LARS can shrink the coefficients to zero. The advantage of this kind of methods is that they can give a solution path which describes the order that variables enter the model. This provides an intuitive way to rank variables based on the path. However, Lasso can sometimes be difficult to apply to variable ranking directly. This is because that in a Lasso solution path, variables might enter the model and then get dropped. This dropping issue makes it hard to rank based on the order of entrance. However, LARS, which is a modified version of Lasso, doesnâ€™t have this problem. Weâ€™ll make use of this property and rank variables using LARS solution path.",2012,

"The late Cenozoic ampullariidae (mollusca, gastropoda) of the Albertine Rift Valley (Uganda-Zaire)","The Albertine Rift Valley (Uganda-Zaire) contains vast sedimentary sequences of late Cenozoic age. They were deposited in an extensive riftlake, Lake Obweruka, which existed from c. 8 Ma to 2.5 Ma and was comparable in size and depth to the present L. Tanganyika.Many freshwater molluscs that occur in these lacustrine deposits are characterised by their aberrant shell morphology, their extreme ornamentation and general form, making them resemble marine species. This convergence, rare in freshwater molluscs, is called thalassoidism and extreme ornamentation in marine as well as in freshwater molluscs is considered to be the result of a gradual process of prey/predator coevolution.In the present paper the Albertine representants of the ampullariid genera Lanistes and Pila, most of which are new to science, are taxonomically described and their phylogenetic relation, based upon apomorphic characters, is given. In addition the evolutionary history of these freshwater snails in the basin has been reconstructed.In the pre-riftlake environment 3 species of Lanistes occurred, with no special shell adaptations against predation. After the formation of a riftlake, 2 of these, colonising the new lacustrine ecospace, changed morphologically and radiated. The 3 derived lines show minor adaptations against predation. After the extinction of the dominant Lanistes species group around 6 Ma, the sole surviving lacustrine Lanistes suddenly radiates, the ancestral line persisting next to the 3 new daughter lines. This second morphological shift is spectacular as it produces shells with distinct thalassoid features. All the Lanistes species of L. Obweruka became extinct during a cataclysmic event around 4.5 Ma. Populations of the genus Pila colonised lacustrine habitats after this event, the derived form also showing striking thalassoid characters. There is no doubt that the intense morphological change occurred during a brief period, geologically speaking. The degree of morphological change in molluscs appears hence not to be linked with time. After the sudden radiation all lineages remain morphologically stable until they became extinct c. 1 Ma later. This pattern corresponds to the punctuated equilibrium model. Other groups (viviparids, thiarids) show more gradual changes.",2004,Hydrobiologia
"Bioremediation technologies for polluted seawater sampled after an oil-spill in Taranto Gulf (Italy): A comparison of biostimulation, bioaugmentation and use of a washing agent in microcosm studies.","One of the main challenges of bioremediation is to define efficient protocols having a low environmental impact. We have investigated the effect of three treatments in oily-seawater after a real oil-spill occurred in the Gulf of Taranto (Italy). Biostimulation with inorganic nutrients allowed the biodegradation of the 73Â±2.4% of hydrocarbons, bioaugmentation with a selected hydrocarbonoclastic consortium consisting of Alcanivorax borkumensis, Alcanivorax dieselolei, Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus, Cycloclasticus sp. 78-ME and Thalassolituus oleivorans degraded 79Â±3.2%, while the addition of nutrients and a washing agent has allowed the degradation of the 69Â±2.6%. On the other hand, microbial community was severely affected by the addition of the washing agent and the same product seemed to inhibit the growth of the majority of strains composing the selected consortium at the tested concentration. The use of dispersant should be accurately evaluated also considering its effect on the principal actors of biodegradation.",2016,Marine pollution bulletin
Asymptotic Theory of the Sparse Group LASSO,"This paper proposes a general framework for penalized convex empirical criteria and a new version of the Sparse-Group LASSO (SGL, Simon and al., 2013), called the adaptive SGL, where both penalties of the SGL are weighted by preliminary random coefficients. We explore extensively its asymptotic properties and prove that this estimator satisfies the so-called oracle property (Fan and Li, 2001), that is the sparsity based estimator recovers the true underlying sparse model and is asymptotically normally distributed. Then we study its asymptotic properties in a double-asymptotic framework, where the number of parameters diverges with the sample size. We show by simulations that the adaptive SGL outperforms other oracle-like methods in terms of estimation precision and variable selection.",2016,arXiv: Statistics Theory

Lutte contre les mouches tsÃ©-tsÃ© en Afrique de lâ€™Ouest : optimisation de lâ€™utilisation de la technique de lâ€™insecte stÃ©rile,"En Afrique sub-saharienne, pres de 10 millions de km2 de terres, les plus fertiles en productions fourrageres et agricoles, sont infestees de mouches tse-tse limitant ainsi les initiatives de developpement dâ€™une agriculture durable. Les tse-tse transmettent des trypanosomes qui sont responsables des trypanosomoses animales et humaines africaines. En 2000, les Chefs dâ€™Etats et de Gouvernements africains ont decide de redoubler dâ€™efforts pour lutter contre les mouches tse-tse et les trypanosomoses en creant la Pan African Tsetse and Trypanosomosis Eradication Campaign (PATTEC). Dans ce contexte, le gouvernement senegalais a initie un programme dâ€™eradication des glossines dans la zone des Niayes en utilisant une souche de Glossina palpalis gambiensis originaire du Burkina Faso. La presente these visait a optimiser lâ€™utilisation de la technique de lâ€™insecte sterile (TIS) en Afrique de lâ€™Ouest pour lutter contre les glossines. Un dispositif de transport sur de longues distances de pupes matures a ete developpe et valide a partir de pupes mÃ¢les de G. p. gambiensis produites et irradiees a Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso et a Bratislava, Slovaquie (irradiation faite a Seibersdorf, Autriche) et transportees par voie aerienne jusquâ€™a Dakar, Senegal. Le dispositif constitue dâ€™une boite isotherme et des packs S8 a permis de maintenir les pupes a une temperature de 10 Â± 3Â°C et de les transporter pendant 2-3 jours jusquâ€™au centre dâ€™emergence de lâ€™ISRA, pour produire des mÃ¢les steriles utilisables pour la technique de lâ€™insecte sterile. Un controle qualite a ete realise sur un echantillon de 50 pupes preleve dans chaque lot de pupes (minimum 2 lots par envoi) pour determiner lâ€™aptitude dâ€™envol des mÃ¢les steriles et leur survie sous stress (a jeun). Le reste des pupes utilise pour les lÃ¢chers sur le terrain a ete considere comme temoin. Le protocole qualite decrit permettra un suivi precis de la qualite des mÃ¢les steriles utilises dans les programmes operationnels dâ€™eradication dans le cadre de la PATTEC. Un outil moleculaire de discrimination de mÃ¢les steriles lÃ¢ches et sauvages a egalement ete developpe a partir du gene mitochondrial COI (cytochrome oxydase) et a montre que les sequences COI des mouches lÃ¢chees (produites en insectarium) sont 100% identiques entre elles et differentes de celles des mouches sauvages. Par ailleurs, afin de determiner les conditions optimales dâ€™elevage de souches de G. p. gambiensis et de determiner la souche qui sera la plus adaptee a tel ou tel environnement ou pays dans le cadre dâ€™une lutte avec une composante lÃ¢cher de mÃ¢les steriles, les traits de vie (survie et fecondite) de trois souches de G. p. gambiensis (souches originaires du Burkina Faso (BKF), Senegal (SEN) et souche introgressee (SENbkf) ont ete evalues dans differentes conditions de temperatures et dâ€™humidites relatives. La temperature optimale dâ€™elevage en masse a ete de 25 Â± 1Â°C, 24,6 Â± 1Â°C et 23,9 Â± 1Â°C pour BKF, SENbkf et SEN respectivement. La variation de lâ€™humidite relative (entre 40 et 75%) a eu tres peu dâ€™influence sur la survie et la fecondite.

"The Cow Who Wouldn't Come Down, and: Who Came Down That Road? (review)","In his first book written for children, well-known Appalachian painter Paul Brett Johnson has created a wonderful story which can be enjoyed by all ages. Using expressive text and illustrations filled with amusing detail, he has introduced a feisty, funny, and resourceful heroine. There is much unexpected delight in this book, as Mr. Iohnson has combined the unlikely scenario of a flying cow with an equally unlikely owner. Miss Rosemary uses a fishing pole, a lasso, and even climbs the roof in her attempts to retrieve her stubborn animal. Children will be particularly drawn to his use of unique language and unusual visual images, as well as to the possible sequel presented at the end of the book. This is certain to become a family favorite.",1993,Appalachian Heritage
Identification of 14-3-3 Proteins Phosphopeptide-Binding Specificity Using an Affinity-Based Computational Approach,"The 14-3-3 proteins are a highly conserved family of homodimeric and heterodimeric molecules, expressed in all eukaryotic cells. In human cells, this family consists of seven distinct but highly homologous 14-3-3 isoforms. 14-3-3Ïƒ is the only isoform directly linked to cancer in epithelial cells, which is regulated by major tumor suppressor genes. For each 14-3-3 isoform, we have 1,000 peptide motifs with experimental binding affinity values. In this paper, we present a novel method for identifying peptide motifs binding to 14-3-3Ïƒ isoform. First, we propose a sampling criteria to build a predictor for each new peptide sequence. Then, we select nine physicochemical properties of amino acids to describe each peptide motif. We also use auto-cross covariance to extract correlative properties of amino acids in any two positions. Finally, we consider elastic net to predict affinity values of peptide motifs, based on ridge regression and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). Our method tests on the 1,000 known peptide motifs binding to seven 14-3-3 isoforms. On the 14-3-3Ïƒ isoform, our method has overall pearson-product-moment correlation coefficient (PCC) and root mean squared error (RMSE) values of 0.84 and 252.31 for N-terminal sublibrary, and 0.77 and 269.13 for C-terminal sublibrary. We predict affinity values of 16,000 peptide sequences and relative binding ability across six permutated positions similar with experimental values. We identify phosphopeptides that preferentially bind to 14-3-3Ïƒ over other isoforms. Several positions on peptide motifs are in the same amino acid category with experimental substrate specificity of phosphopeptides binding to 14-3-3Ïƒ. Our method is fast and reliable and is a general computational method that can be used in peptide-protein binding identification in proteomics research.",2016,PLoS ONE
Management of children with neurological disorders.,"Children are not just miniature adults. They differ from adults in their way of thinking, as pointed out by Jean-Jacques Rousseau and, more recently, by Jean Piaget and others. And, of course, there are differences between the nervous system of children and adults, the pathological processes that affect it, and the clinical symptoms and signs of neurological involvement. Hence the management of children with neurological disorders requires specific skills and knowledge. Previous series of the Handbook of Clinical Neurology did not include a volume or section dealing with this area. We are therefore very pleased to introduce for the first time three volumes dedicated to neuropediatrics. The three volumes have been edited by an international team composed of Olivier Dulac (Paris, France), Maryse Lassonde (Montreal, Canada), and Harvey B. Sarnat (Calgary, Canada). As series editors, we reviewed all the chapters in the volumes and made suggestions for improvement, and we are delighted that the volume editors and chapter authors have produced such scholarly and comprehensive accounts of different aspects of neuropediatrics. The volumes cover the whole gamut of neurological diseases in children. There is considerable emphasis on potentially treatable conditions such as epilepsy and related disorders; on infectious diseases; on genetics; and on metabolic disorders. The volume also covers in depth issues related to development as well as ethical problems in clinical practice and in research. We very much hope that the three volumes will appeal to clinicians and neuroscientists alike. Specifically, our aim has been to provide basic researchers with the foundations for new approaches to the study of these disorders, and clinicians with a state-of-the-art reference that summarizes the clinical features and management of the many manifestations of neurological disorders in children. In addition to the print form, the Handbook series is now available electronically on Elsevierâ€™s Science Direct site. This should make it even more accessible to readers and should facilitate searches for specific information. We are grateful to the volume editors and to the numerous authors who contributed their time and expertise to summarize developments in their field and helped put together these outstanding volumes. As always, we are grateful also to the team at Elsevier and in particular to Mr. Michael Parkinson, Mr. Thomas E. Stone, and Ms. Kristi Anderson for their unfailing and expert assistance in the development and production of these three volumes.",2013,Handbook of clinical neurology
Microflores des formations du Gabon attribuÃ©es au Karroo,"In Gabon the thick Cretaceous and Tertiary successions are found lying on a sedimentary sequence which is now considered to be a correlative of the Karroo formations. This correlation has been established on the basis of well-preserved and characteristic palynological assemblages. Unfossiliferous glacial deposits, probably assignable to the Dwyka, are overlain by the clastics and dolomites of the â€œSerie de l'Agoulaâ€. The latter formation is characterized by the occurrence of three distinctive palynological assemblages: 
1. 
(1) An assemblage in the lower part of the formation is composed of monosaccates, striate monosaccates, striate disaccates, and some characteristic pollen grains such as Walikalesaccates,ellipticus, Hoegiasaccites transitus, Fusacolpites ovatus and Fusacolpites fusus. This assemblage can be compared with assemblages from the â€œSerie des Schistes Noirs de Walikale et Lukugaâ€ in Zaire (Congo Kinshasa) which has been assigned to the Early Permian (Sakmarian) Ecca formations. 
 
2. 
(2) An assemblage in the middle part of the formation includes Corisaccites spp., Lueckisporites spp., Hamiapollenites karrooensis and Protohaploxypinus spp. This assemblage compares with assemblages from the Lower Coal Measures of Tanganyika (Ecca), the Upper Barakar and Raniganj of India, and the Lower Permian of the Salt Range; it is considered to be diagnostic of the upper part of the Lower Permian (Artinskian-Kungurian). 
 
3. 
(3) After an important unfossiliferous interval the upper part of the formation is characterized by an assemblage with Klausipollenites schaubergeri, Lueckisporites virkkiae and Taeniaesporites noviaulensis. This Late Permian assemblage has a European appearance. 
 
 
 
 
The â€œSerie de l'Agoulaâ€ is overlain by the clastics of the â€œSerie de M'Voneâ€ yielding a Middle Jurassic palynological assemblage with Classopollis torosus, Callialasporites dampieri and Spheripollenites scabratus. After another unfossiliferous interval (N'Dombo), Cretaceous sedimentation commences with the dominantly argillaceous deposits of the â€œSerie de Kangoâ€ yielding a palynological assemblage with Dicheiropollis etruscus, Classopollis classoides, Ephedripites spp. and Cicatricosisporites spp.",1974,Review of Palaeobotany and Palynology
Many Average Partial Effects: with An Application to Text Regression,"We study estimation, pointwise and simultaneous inference, and confidence intervals for many average partial effects of lasso Logit. Focusing on high-dimensional, cluster-sampling environments, we propose a new average partial effect estimator and explore its asymptotic properties. Practical penalty choices compatible with our asymptotic theory are also provided. The proposed estimator allow for valid inference without requiring oracle property. We provide easy-to-implement algorithms for cluster-robust high-dimensional hypothesis testing and construction of simultaneously valid confidence intervals using a multiplier cluster bootstrap.

Tissue-infiltrating lymphocytes signature predicts survival in patients with early/intermediate stage hepatocellular carcinoma,"BackgroundIntratumoral immune infiltrates have manifested a robust prognostic signature in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We hypothesized that a novel tissue-related immune signature (TRIS) could improve the prediction of postoperative survival for patients diagnosed with early/intermediate HCC.MethodsTwenty-eight immune features were immunohistochemically examined on 352 HCC specimens. The LASSO Cox regression model was used to construct a five-feature-based TRIS. The univariate and multivariate Cox analyses were performed. Based on independent predictors, the immune-clinical prognostic index (ICPI) was established. Performance assessment was measured with C-index and compared with seven traditional staging systems. The independent validation cohort (nÂ =â€‰393) was included to validate the model.ResultsBy using the LASSO method, the TRIS were constructed on the basis of five immune features, CD3intratumoral (T), CD27T, CD68peritumoral (P), CD103T, and PD1T. Multivariate Cox analysis showed that the TRIS was an independent prognostic predictor. In the training cohort, Î³-glutamyl transferase, tumor diameter, tumor differentiation, and TRIS were incorporated into the ICPI. The ICPI presented satisfactory discrimination ability, with C-index values of 0.691 and 0.686 in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. Compared with seven conventional staging systems (C-index, training cohort, 0.548â€“0.597; validation cohort, 0.519â€“0.610), the ICPI exhibited better performance for early/intermediate-stage HCCs. Further, the patients were categorized into three subgroups with X-tile software, and the stratified ICPI presented a superior corrected Akaike information criterion and homogeneity in both cohorts.ConclusionsOur ICPI was a useful and reliable prognostic tool which may offer good individualized prediction capability for HCC patients with early/intermediate stage.",2019,BMC Medicine

Fighting first broke out between Gumbu and rival, neighboring, even related political formations. Alliances and conflicts were not based on ethnie groups. Through these wars, people gloried in their group and asserted their families' political ambition; the social wounds these wars inflicted on various parties have left lasting memories. The nature of this warfare changed as more powerful states (Segu, Masina or Dina) brought pressure to bear. These states, developing thanks to the Atlantic slave trade, came to arbitrate conflicts in this region.

Some Rates of Convergence for the Selected Lasso Estimator,"We consider the estimation of a function in some ordered finite or infinite dictionary. We focus on the selected Lasso estimator introduced by Massart and Meynet (2011) as an adaptation of the Lasso suited to deal with infinite dictionaries. We use the oracle inequality established by Massart and Meynet (2011) to derive rates of convergence of this estimator on a wide range of function classes described by interpolation spaces such as in Barron et al. (2008). The results highlight that the selected Lasso estimator is adaptive to the smoothness of the function to be estimated, contrary to the classical Lasso or the greedy algorithm considered by Barron et al. (2008). Moreover, we prove that the rates of convergence of this estimator are optimal in the orthonormal case.",2012,

Cross-validation is risk consistent for lasso under orthogonal design,"The lasso has become so ubiquitous in statistics that it can be considered a paradigm for inference and prediction. During the last fifteen years, the lasso procedure has been the target of a substantial amount of theoretical and applied research. Correspondingly, many results are known about its behavior for a fixed or optimally chosen smoothing parameter. These results, such as sparsistency and risk consistency, are of some comfort when using the lasso in applications. However, much less is known about its behavior when the smoothing parameter is chosen in a data dependent way, which is almost always the case in practice. To this end, we give the first definitive answer about the risk consistency of lasso when the smoothing parameter is chosen empirically using the same data that are used to fit the lasso estimator. We show that under restrictions on the design matrix, the lasso estimator is still risk consistent when the smoothing parameter is chosen via cross-validation.",2012,arXiv: Statistics Theory
Software Fault Proneness Prediction with Group Lasso Regression: On Factors that Affect Classification Performance,"Machine learning algorithms have been used extensively for software fault proneness prediction. This paper presents the first application of Group Lasso Regression (G-Lasso) for software fault proneness classification and compares its performance to six widely used machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, we explore the effects of two factors on the prediction performance: the effect of imbalance treatment using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), and the effect of datasets used in building the prediction models. Our experimental results are based on 22 datasets extracted from open source projects. The main findings include: (1) G-Lasso is robust to imbalanced data and significantly outperforms the other machine learning algorithms with respect to the Recall and G-Score, i.e., the harmonic mean of Recall and (1- False Positive Rate). (2) Even though SMOTE improved the performance of all learners, it did not have statistically significant effect on G-Lasso's Recall and G-Score. Random Forest was in the top performing group of learners for all performance metrics, while Naive Bayes performed the worst of all learners. (3) When using the same change metrics as features, the choice of the dataset had no effect on the performance of most learners, including G-Lasso. Naive Bayes was the most affected, especially when balanced datasets were used.",2019,2019 IEEE 43rd Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference (COMPSAC)
Non-invasive genotype prediction of chromosome 1p/19q co-deletion by development and validation of an MRI-based radiomics signature in lower-grade gliomas,"To pre-operatively and non-invasively predict 1p/19q co-deletion in grade II and III (lower-grade) glioma based on a radiomics method using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We obtained 105 patients pathologically diagnosed with lower-grade glioma. We extracted 647 MRI-based features from T2-weighted images and selected discriminative features by lasso logistic regression approaches on the training cohort (n=69). Radiomics, clinical, and combined models were constructed separately to verify the predictive performance of the radiomics signature. The predictability of the three models were validated on a time-independent validation cohort (n = 36). Finally, 7 discriminative radiomic features were used constructed radiomics signature, which demonstrated satisfied performance on both the training and validation cohorts with AUCs of 0.822 and 0.731, respectively. Particularly, the combined model incorporating the radiomics signature and the clinic-radiological factors achieved the best discriminative capability with AUCs of 0.911 and 0.866 for training and validation cohorts, respectively.",2019,

"The Case of Lagos, Nigeria*","Voluntary associations are significant mechanisms by which migrants can be integrated into a new urban milieu, yet not all individuals or sectors of city populations belong to them. While it is widely accepted that associations have a role to play in urban west Africa by offering welfare services (Little, 1965), providing political outlets in the broad sense of that term (Wallerstein, 1966), or defining status (Eisenstadt, 1956), little is known about the configurations of membership (but see Meillassoux, 1968). In order to understand more fully the part that voluntary associations play in the lives of city dwellers it is still necessary to ask fundamental questions. For example: 1) What percentages of urban populations actually belong to, and are active in, voluntary associations? 2) What kinds of voluntary associations are preferred? 3) Who belongs to what kinds of associations? In other words we still need to know to whom voluntary associations are important and to whom they are relatively unimportant.

Quentin Meillassoux: A New French Philosopher,"QUENTIN MEILLASSOUX A NEW FRENCH PHILOSOPHER This article is a review of Apres lafinitude, the remarkable debut book of Quentin Meillassoux.1 In my estimation, this work is one of the most important to appear in continental philosophy in recent years, and deserves a wide readership at the earliest possible date. An English translation by Ray Brassier will be published by Continuum in the near future.2 Meillassoux's book is written in a lucid and economical style, covering abundant terrain in just 165 pages. It offers bold readings of the history of philosophy-Aristotle is not realist enough, Hume not skeptical enough. It shows bursts of scathing wit, as when drawing wry parallels between the anti-Darwinian reveries of creationism and major schools of presentday philosophy. Most importantly, Apres la finitude offers a ruthless attack on virtually all of post-Kantian philosophy, now labeled as ""correlationism,"" and proposes an original ""speculative"" solution (though not in Hegel's sense) to the Kantian impasse. Meillassoux proposes nothing less than a return of philosophy to the absolute, which for him means reality in itself apart from any relation to humans. The critical portions of the book strike me as definitive: much of what we know as analytic and continental philosophy looks rather different following his assault on correlationism. Meillassoux's own ideas, plausibly described as the mere antechamber to a larger and still unpublished system, lie open to possible objections. Nonetheless, his appeal to an ""ancestral"" realm prior to all human access succeeds in defining an unexpected new battlefield for continental thought. Barely forty years old, he seems likely to emerge as one of the important names in European philosophy in the decades to come. We should begin by situating Meillassoux among the more established contemporary thinkers. For many years, continental philosophy in the Anglophone world was dominated by Heidegger and Derrida. Neither of these figures will soon disappear from radar, and Heidegger is now celebrated as a classic for the ages even by mainstream analytic thinkers. But since the miH-1990s, the HeideggeroDerridean brand of continental thought has faced increasing competition from new trends: initially from the books of Gilles Deleuze, and more recently from the heterodox tag team of Alain Badiou and a resurgent Slavoj Zizek. While major works by these ""new"" authors have been available for many years, what is more recent is their increased momentum among the younger generation of continental philosophers. In terms of background and orientation, Meillassoux is not difficult to place among these currents. He was a student of Badiou, and the preface to the book is written by Badiou himself, who can barely find sufficient words to praise it-by fusing absolute logical necessity with a radical contingency of the laws of nature, Meillassoux is said to ""open in the history of philosophy... a new path foreign to Kant's canonical distribution between 'dogmatism,' 'scepticism,' and 'critique.'""3 Furthermore, despite the absence of set-theory notation and other known Badiouian flourishes, there are obvious points of similarity between teacher and student: the major role for mathematics, including the anointment of Georg Cantor as a pivotal figure for philosophy; the fondness for step-by-step logical argumentation; the absence of any especial interest in Heidegger or the phenomenological tradition. Both authors also display grand systematic ambitions of a kind that seemed unthinkable in our field a short time ago. Nonetheless, Meillassoux's vision of the world is not Badiou's, and certain aspects of the former even cut against the grain of the latter. According to published information, Meillassoux was born in 1967 in Paris, son of the economic anthropologist Claude Meillassoux (19252005), an intellectual maverick in his own right. He is a graduate of the Ecole Normale Superieure, and has been employed at that institution for the past decade. â€¦",2007,Philosophy Today
Principal Component Clustered Factors for Determining Study Performance in Computer Programming Class,"Studying computer programming requires not only an understanding of theories and concepts, but also coding pragmatism. Success in studying or conducting such a course is definitely a challenge. This paper proposes a model that transforms studentsâ€™ attributes (including the cognitive and non-cognitive abilities, and traditional lagging measures of academic background) into a set of principal components (PCs). As opposed to traditional approaches, the proposed model optimally extracts the orthogonal PCs to form a basis for determining the studying performance of students in terms of declarative knowledge and procedural proficiency (or skill). The obtained relationship model yields two contributive values (1) an optimal set of determinants, in the form of studentsâ€™ clusters, to determine study performance and (2) the fully preserved interpretability of the original attributes of students in each PC. The experiment was conducted using 115 complete datasets of IT major students who enrolled the Introduction to Computer Programming course. The Best Subset Selection and LASSO algorithms were deployed to find the optimal set of features. The effectiveness of the model was validated by multiple linear regression to predict the performance in terms of knowledge and skills with an accuracy of 76.52%, and 70.44%, respectively. Insights into the interpretability of student clusters are provided.",2020,Wireless Personal Communications
"Description of Halichoeres rubrovirens , a new species of wrasse (Labridae: Perciformes) from the Trindade and Martin Vaz Island group, southeastern Brazil, with a preliminary mtDNA molecular phylogeny of New World Halichoeres","Here we describe Halichoeres rubrovirens, sp. n., endemic to Trindade and Martin Vaz Islands, off southeastern Brazil. The new species has unique color pattern, morphology and genetics. It can be easily distinguished from its Atlantic congeners by its color pattern consisting of a green body with two broad dotted reddish stripes. A preliminary mtDNA phylogeny indicates that H. rubrovirens closest relative is in the tropical Eastern Pacific. Hence, we hypothesize that H. rubrovirens once had a wide distribution in the western Atlantic but currently consists of a relict species restricted to Trindade and Martin Vaz islands. Little is know about its biology and ecology, but juveniles seem to school with and mimic Thalassoma noronhanum, which they resemble in color.",2010,Zootaxa
Water level fluctuations and the ecosystem functioning of lakes,"Abstract Hydrological regimes are key drivers of productivity and structure in freshwater ecosystems but are increasingly impacted by human activity. Using 17 published food web models of 13 African lakes as a case study, we explored relationships between seasonal and interannual water level fluctuations and 15 attributes related to ecosystem function. We interpreted our results in the context of Odum's ecosystem maturity hypothesis, as systems with higher magnitude fluctuations may be kept at an earlier maturity stage than those that are relatively stable. The data we compiled indicate that long-term changes in the hydrological regimes of African lakes have already taken place. We used Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression to examine relationships between ecosystem attributes and seven physical characteristics. Of these characteristics, interannual water level fluctuation magnitude was the most frequently retained predictor in the regression models. Our results indicate that interannual water level fluctuations are positively correlated with primary and overall production, but negatively correlated with fish diversity, transfer efficiency, and food chain length. These trends are opposite those expected with increasing ecosystem maturity. Interestingly, we found seasonal water level fluctuations to be positively correlated with biomass. An increase in standing biomass is generally associated with more mature ecosystems. However, we found that less production and biomass occurred at high trophic levels in highly fluctuating compared to relatively stable systems. This synthesis provides evidence that water level fluctuations are a key process influencing ecosystem structure and function in lakes.",2018,Journal of Great Lakes Research

"Comments on the cervical vertebrae of the Tapejaridae (Pterosauria, Pterodactyloidea) with description of new specimens","The cervical series is poorly known in several pterosaur clades despite the fact that distinct morphotypes of individual elements have been recognised. Among the least known is the neck of the Tapejaridae that until recently has received little attention. In order to provide further data on the tapejarid cervical anatomy, we describe three specimens from the Romualdo Formation (Lower Cretaceous, Brazil): AMNH 22568 comprises the last five cervical elements of a large individual, AMNH 24445 and MN 4728-V, both including three meso-cervical elements of small individuals. Despite size differences, AMNH 22568 and MN 4728-V are anatomically more similar to each another, showing a pattern of high, laterally flattened (blade-like) neural spines, short centra pierced by two lateral pneumatic foramina. AMNH 24445 presents a distinct anatomy, with low (but still evident) neural spines, more elongated centra with concave ventral surface, and only one lateral pneumatic foramen. Based on comparative studies we refer AMNH 22568 and MN 4728-V to the Thalassodrominae and AMNH 24445 to the Tapejarinae, helping to differentiate the cervical elements of these clades. Thalassodrominae cervical vertebrae can be distinguished by the presence of two lateral pneumatic foramina, a broad centrum (length/width ratio lower than two), and a flat ventral surface. Tapejarinae cervical vertebrae show only one lateral pneumatic foramen, the length/width ratio higher than two, and a concave ventral surface. Thalassodromine and tapejarine cervical vertebrae differ from those of azhdarchids in the presence of lateral pneumatic foramens, developed neural spine, and length/width ratio lower than three, and by being comparatively shorter.",2015,Historical Biology
Evaluating Russian Economic Growth without the Revolution of 1917 âˆ—,"This paper uses modern econometric techniques, such as the lasso and the synthetic control method, to construct the counterfactual GDP per capita series for Russia for 1917â€“1940.

"Comparison of Normalized Gain and Cohen's ""d"" for Analyzing Gains on Concept Inventories.","Measuring student learning is a complicated but necessary task for understanding the effectiveness of instruction and issues of equity in college STEM courses. Our investigation focused on the implications on claims about student learning that result from choosing between one of two commonly used methods for analyzing shifts in concept inventories. The methods are: Hake's gain (g), which is the most common method used in physics education research and other discipline based education research fields, and Cohen's d, which is broadly used in education research and many other fields. Data for the analyses came from the Learning Assistant Supported Student Outcomes (LASSO) database and included test scores from 4,551 students on physics, chemistry, biology, and math concept inventories from 89 courses at 17 institutions from across the United States. We compared the two methods across all of the concept inventories. The results showed that the two methods led to different inferences about student learning and equity due to g being biased in favor of high pretest populations. Recommendations for the analysis and reporting of findings on student learning data are included.",2016,

An efficient and cost-effective method for DNA extraction from athalassohaline soil using a newly formulated cell extraction buffer,"The present study describes the rapid and efficient indirect lysis method for environmental DNA extraction from athalassohaline soil by newly formulated cell extraction buffer. The available methods are mostly based on direct lysis which leads to DNA shearing and co-extraction of extra cellular DNA that influences the community and functional analysis. Moreover, during extraction of DNA by direct lysis from athalassohaline soil, it was observed that, upon addition of poly ethylene glycol (PEG), isopropanol or absolute ethanol for precipitation of DNA, salt precipitates out and affecting DNA yield significantly. Therefore, indirect lysis method was optimized for extraction of environmental DNA from such soil containing high salts and low microbial biomass (CFU 4.3Â Ã—Â 104 per gram soil) using newly formulated cell extraction buffer in combination with low and high speed centrifugation. The cell extraction buffer composition and its concentration were optimized and PEG 8000 (1Â %; w/v) and 1Â M NaCl gave maximum cell mass for DNA extraction. The cell extraction efficiency was assessed with acridine orange staining of soil samples before and after cell extraction. The efficiency, reproducibility and purity of extracted DNA by newly developed procedure were compared with previously recognized methods and kits having different protocols including indirect lysis. The extracted environmental DNA showed better yield (5.6Â Â±Â 0.7Â Î¼gÂ gâˆ’1) along with high purity ratios. The purity of DNA was validated by assessing its usability in various molecular techniques like restriction enzyme digestion, amplification of 16S rRNA gene using PCR and UVâ€“Visible spectroscopy analysis.",2016,3 Biotech
"Blood transfusions in colorectal cancer surgery: incidence, outcomes, and predictive factors: an American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program analysis.","BACKGROUND
Data analyzing the short-term outcomes and predictors of blood transfusions (BTs) in colorectal cancer (CRC) surgery are limited.


METHODS
The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (2005 to 2010) was retrospectively reviewed for CRC cases performed with or without BT. Patient demographics, comorbidities, and operative variables were analyzed. Multivariate regression analysis was performed examining the effect of BT on outcomes. The LASSO algorithm for logistic regression was used to build a predictive model for BT taking into account preoperative and operative variables.


RESULTS
A total of 27,120 patients underwent CRC, and 3,815 (14.07%) had BTs. Transfusions were associated with increased mortality (odds ratio [OR], 1.78), morbidity (OR, 2.38), length of stay (mean difference, 3.52 days), pneumonia (OR, 2.70), and surgical-site infection (OR, 1.45). This effect was ""dose dependent,"" as patients receiving â‰¥3 U of blood had increased morbidity (OR, 1.53), lengths of stay (mean difference, 1.82 days), pneumonia (OR, 2.52), and surgical-site infections (OR, 1.60) compared with those receiving 1 to 2 U. Predictors of BT were hematocrit <38%, open surgery, proctectomy, low platelet count, American Society of Anesthesiologists class IV or V, total colectomy, metastatic cancer, emergency, ascites, and infection. All P values were < .05.


CONCLUSIONS
BTs are associated with worse short-term outcomes after CRC surgery. Knowledge of predictive factors will help in risk stratification and counseling.",2013,American journal of surgery
Too Sweet/Too Fatty Food Consumption: Determinants among Secondary School Pupils in the City of Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina Faso),"Introduction: Nutrition, particularly when too sweet or too fatty, is a major determinant of chronic diseases. This study aims to determine the frequency and associate factors of the excessive consumption of sweet drinks and fried food among secondary school pupils. Methods: It is cross-sectional study which was conducted from March to April 2016 among 1st, 4th and 7th form pupils of public and private schools in the city of Bobo-Dioulasso. Nutritional investigation methods consisted in a reminder of the last 24 hours associated with a questionnaire on food consumption frequency. Excessive consumption of sweet drinks was defined as a consumption of more than 3 sweet drinks (soda) or sugary juice per day (~33 cl Ã— 3); and excessive consumption of fried food as a consumption of more than 1 intake of fried food per day. Results: In total, 1993 pupils were interviewed. The mean age was 17.5 Â± 3.6 years and sex-ratio 0.7. Excessive consumption of sweet drinks and fried food was recorded in 12.7% (n = 253) and 28.2% (n = 561) of pupils, respectively. The factors associated with excessive consumption of sweet drinks were: sex/female, sedentarily, desire to gain weight, lean or normal corpulence of the mother and breakfast intake; those associated with excessive consumption of fried food were: sex/female, being in 1st or 4th form, physical exercise practice and breakfast intake. But the fact to attend a private secondary school, to have a mother of normal corpulence and a concordance between self-image and actual weight status, were protective against excessive consumption of fried foods. Conclusion: This study has displayed prominently the fact that eating too sweet and too fatty concerned respectively 1/10 and 3/10 of pupils in the city of Bobo-Dioulasso. The main modifiable factors of these eating habits included the level of education, the composition of breakfast and the influence of mothers. An intervention program in the form of a Communication for Continuous Behavioral Change intended for pupils and their mothers could help to improve this situation.",2018,Open Journal of Pediatrics
Experimentelle Untersuchung und Optimierung der KÃ¼hlung von Brennkammerbauteilen stationÃ¤rer Gasturbinen,"Bei der Weiterentwicklung stationarer Gasturbinen werden aufgrund steigender Turbineneintrittstemperaturen immer hohere Anforderungen an die eingesetzten Kuhlmechanismen gestellt. Prallkuhlungs- und konvektive Kuhlmethoden bieten im Bereich der Brennkammerkuhlung eine Alternative zur traditionellen Filmkuhlung, da durch sie einerseits die Schadstoffkonzentration im Abgas reduziert wird und andererseits die gesamte verdichtete Luft zur Verbrennung genutzt werden kann. Da mit bestehenden Korrelationen oder Untersuchungen fur einfache Geometrien die Stromung und damit der Warmeubergang in komplexen Geometrien nur eingeschrankt beschrieben werden konnen, kann auf Untersuchungen an realitatsnahen Modellen nicht verzichtet werden. 
In der vorliegenden Arbeit werden die Moglichkeiten der Warmeubergangsintensivierung in unterschiedlichen Brennkammerbauteilen experimentell untersucht. Hierzu werden an drei verschiedenen Versuchsstanden Warmeubergangsmessungen durchgefuhrt und durch Stromungsmessungen erganzt. 
Die experimentelle Bestimmung des Warmeubergangs erfolgt mit Methoden, die auf der Temperaturbestimmung mit thermochromatischen Flussigkristallen basieren. Bei der stationaren Methode wird der Warmeubergangskoeffizient aus der Randbedingung eines konstanten Warmestroms, der mit Heizfolien auf der Wand aufgepragt wird, bestimmt. Bei der transienten Methode wird er uber den zeitlichen Verlauf der Wandtemperatur infolge eines Temperatursprungs in der Stromung berechnet. 
Das Sekundarstromungsfeld wird mittels der 2d-PIV-Methode vermessen, die auf der Beobachtung von in der Stromung mitbewegten Teilchen basiert. 
Im ersten Teil der Arbeit wird die Warmeubergangserhohung in einem rechteckigen, flachen Kanal mit einem Breiten-Hohen-Verhaltnis von sechs untersucht. Dimples auf der breiten Kanalseite sorgen fur eine grosflachige Steigerung des Warmeubergangs, und durch das Anbringen lokaler Rippen wird der Warmeubergang im Seitenbereich zusatzlich optimiert. Hierbei kommen sowohl auf der schmalen Seitenwand als auch im Seitenbereich der breiten Kanalwand unterschiedliche Rippenkonfigurationen zum Einsatz. Es wird gezeigt, dass die Rippen lokal ein hohes Potenzial zur Warmeubergangssteigerung besitzen, wahrend der zusatzliche Druckverlust durch ihre geringe Grose sehr niedrig ausfallt. 
Der zweite Teil der Arbeit beschaftigt sich mit der Warmeubergangssteigerung in einem gekrummten Brennkammerkuhlkanal mit veranderlichem Querschnitt. Vier verschiedene Prallkuhlmuster werden mit einem glatten und einem mit Dimples versehenen Kanal kombiniert. Es zeigt sich, dass die Wahl des Prallmusters einen deutlichen Einfluss auf die lokale Nuseltzahlverteilung im Prallbereich hat, jedoch spielt sie fur den Warmeubergang stromab der Prallkuhlzone sowie fur die mittlere Nuseltzahl fast keine Rolle. Durch die Dimples im hinteren Kanalbereich wird eine deutliche lokale Warmeubergangssteigerung erreicht. Der zusatzliche Druckverlust der Dimples ist dagegen verhaltnismasig niedrig. 
Im dritten Teil der Arbeit werden die Moglichkeiten der Warmeubergangsintensivierung auf der Ruckseite eines Brennkammer-Hitzeschutzschildes untersucht. Es werden hierzu zwei unterschiedliche, unregelmasige Prallstrahlanordnungen in Kombination mit verschiedenen realistischen Stromungsauslassen eingesetzt. Es wird gezeigt, dass durch die Wahl der Prallstrahlanordnung und der Art der Auslassoffnungen die Stromung und damit der Warmeubergang auf allen Flachen deutlich beeinflusst werden. 
Modern gas turbines are under continuous development. Increasing turbine inlet temperatures require the development of efficient cooling technologies for highly stressed gas turbine parts. For the cooling of the combustion chamber, impingement cooling and convective cooling concepts are used as an alternative to the traditional film cooling, because of reduced emissions. In addition, all compressed air can be used for combustion. Because the flow and the heat transfer in complex geometries can not be predicted sufficiently by existing correlations or examinations for simple geometries, investigations in realistic test models are essential. 
In the present work the possibilities of heat transfer improvement in different combustion chamber parts are investigated experimentally. Therefore heat transfer experiments and flow field measurements are performed in three different experimental setups. 
For the investigation of the heat transfer methods are used which are based on the temperature measurement with thermochromic liquid crystals. With the stationary liquid crystal method the heat transfer coefficients are determined from the boundary condition of a constant wall heat flux, which is realized with heating foils. With the transient liquid crystal method the heat transfer coefficients are calculated from the transient development of the wall temperature due to a temperature step in the main flow. The velocity distribution is measured with 2d Particle Image Velocimetry, which is based on the observation of particles in the flow. 
In the first part of the present work the heat transfer enhancement in a rectangular channel with an aspect ratio of six is studied. Dimples which are placed on the bottom wall of the channel are able to enhance the heat transfer globally. Additionally, ribs are placed in the side wall region to optimize the heat transfer locally. Different rib configurations on the side wall as well as on the side part of the bottom wall are investigated. It is shown that the ribs are able to increase the Nuselt number locally, whereas the additional pressure loss is very low due to the small size of the ribs. 
The second part of this work deals with the heat transfer enhancement in a curved combustion chamber liner with varying cross section. Four different impingement patterns are combined with a smooth and a dimpled channel. It is shown that the choice of the impingement pattern has a clear influence on the local Nuselt number distribution in the impingement zone. However, the heat transfer downstream of the impingement region and the averaged Nuselt number are only affected little. Due to the dimples the heat transfer can be significantly improved, whereas the additional pressure loss is very low. 
In the third part of the present work the possibilities of heat transfer improvement on the back side of a combustor liner heat shield are investigated. Two different irregular impingement patterns are combined with realistic outlet conditions. It is shown that a variation of the impingement pattern and the outlet conditions has a substantial influence on the flow and on the heat transfer distribution on all heat shield surfaces.",2008,
Folding Rate Optimization Promotes Frustrated Interactions in Entangled Protein Structures,"Many native structures of proteins accomodate complex topological motifs such as knots, lassos, and other geometrical entanglements. How proteins can fold quickly even in the presence of such topological obstacles is a debated question in structural biology. Recently, the hypothesis that energetic frustration might be a mechanism to avoid topological frustration has been put forward based on the empirical observation that loops involved in entanglements are stabilized by weak interactions between amino-acids at their extrema. To verify this idea, we use a toy lattice model for the folding of proteins into two almost identical structures, one entangled and one not. As expected, the folding time is longer when random sequences folds into the entangled structure. This holds also under an evolutionary pressure simulated by optimizing the folding time. It turns out that optmized protein sequences in the entangled structure are in fact characterized by frustrated interactions at the closures of entangled loops. This phenomenon is much less enhanced in the control case where the entanglement is not present. Our findings, which are in agreement with experimental observations, corroborate the idea that an evolutionary pressure shapes the folding funnel to avoid topological and kinetic traps.",2019,International Journal of Molecular Sciences
Shrinkage and Variable Selection by Polytopes,"Abstract Constrained estimators that enforce variable selection and grouping of highly correlated data have been shown to be successful in finding sparse representations and obtaining good performance in prediction. We consider polytopes as a general class of compact and convex constraint regions. Well-established procedures like LASSO ( Tibshirani, 1996 ) or OSCAR ( Bondell and Reich, 2008 ) are shown to be based on specific subclasses of polytopes. The general framework of polytopes can be used to investigate the geometric structure that underlies these procedures. Moreover, we propose a specifically designed class of polytopes that enforces variable selection and grouping. Simulation studies and an application illustrate the usefulness of the proposed method.",2012,Journal of Statistical Planning and Inference
Structured multi-class feature selection with an application to face recognition,"In this paper we address the problem of structured feature selection in a multi-class classification setting. Our goal is to select groups of features meaningful to all classes simultaneously, and to this purpose we derive a new formulation of Group LASSO - the MC-GrpLASSO - and a solution of the obtained functional based on proximal methods. We then apply the algorithm to a typical multi-class problem - face recognition. On this respect we focus on finding an effective and fast to compute (that is, sparse) representation of faces, detected in low quality videos of unconstrained environments. We start from a classical over-complete representation based on Local Binary Patterns (LBPs), descriptors endowed with a characteristic internal structure that can be preserved by selecting features in groups. We present an extensive experimental analysis on two benchmark datasets, MOBO and Choke Point, and on a more complex set of data acquired in-house over a large temporal span. We compare our results with state-of-the-art approaches and show the superiority of our method in terms of both performances and sparseness of the obtained solution.",2015,Pattern Recognit. Lett.
Adaptive balancing of gradient and update computation times using global geometry and approximate subproblems,"First-order optimization methods comprise two important primitives: i) the computation of gradient information and ii) the computation of the update that leads to the next iterate. In practice there is often a wide mismatch between the time required for the two steps, leading to underutilization of resources. In this work, we propose a new framework, Approx Composite Minimization (ACM) that uses approximate update steps to ensure balance between the two operations. The accuracy is adaptively chosen in an online fashion to take advantage of changing conditions. Our unified analysis for approximate composite minimization generalizes and extends previous work to new settings. Numerical experiments on Lasso regression and SVMs demonstrate the effectiveness of the novel scheme.",2018,
Pharmacometabolomics applied to zonisamide pharmacokinetic parameter prediction,"IntroductionZonisamide is a new-generation anticonvulsant antiepileptic drug metabolized primarily in the liver, with subsequent elimination via the renal route.ObjectivesOur objective was to evaluate the utility of pharmacometabolomics in the detection of zonisamide metabolites that could be related to its disposition and therefore, to its efficacy and toxicity.MethodsThis study was nested to a bioequivalence clinical trial with 28 healthy volunteers. Each participant received a single dose of zonisamide on two separate occasions (period 1 and period 2), with a washout period between them. Blood samples of zonisamide were obtained from all patients at baseline for each period, before volunteers were administered any medication, for metabolomics analysis.ResultsAfter a Lasso regression was applied, age, height, branched-chain amino acids, steroids, triacylglycerols, diacyl glycerophosphoethanolamine, glycerophospholipids susceptible to methylation, phosphatidylcholines with 20:4 FA (arachidonic acid) and cholesterol ester and lysophosphatidylcholine were obtained in both periods.ConclusionTo our knowledge, this is the only research study to date that has attempted to link basal metabolomic status with pharmacokinetic parameters of zonisamide.",2018,Metabolomics
College Studentsâ€™ Willingness to Engage in Bystander Intervention at Off-Campus Parties,"Recent research has documented the high-risk nature of off-campus parties involving college students (Vander Ven, 2011; Jakeman, Silver, & Molasso, 2014), which may involve high-risk drinking, sexual assault, violence, drug overdose, student injury, and even death (Harford, Wechsler, & Muthen, 2003; Hingson, Zha, & Weitzman, 2009; Marzell, Bavarian, Paschall, Mair, & Saltz, 2015). Colleges and universities have attempted to deal with the risks posed by off-campus parties with various efforts, including policies restricting the party environment, efforts to build community coalitions, as well as the creation of targeted education and training programs for students (DeJong & Langford, 2002; Berkowitz, 2003). Perhaps one of the most well-known efforts to address issues of injury, violence, and sexual assault at colleges and universities is peer and bystander intervention training. Bystander intervention programs are diverse, involving a variety of strategies and foci. While some programs specifically address sexual assault (McMahon, Postmus, Warrener, & Koenick, 2014; Alegria-Flores, Raker, Pleasants, Weaver, & Weinberger, 2015), others target issues associated with environments where students consume alcohol (Johnson, 2009). These programs aim to facilitate and encourage student intervention in problematic situations, especially in environments where university officials may not be present, such as off-campus parties. Studies have determined that bystander intervention depends on a variety of factors, perhaps most importantly, that bystanders recognize the situation as problematic and that they be willing to intervene (Latane & Darley, 1970; Hoefnagels & Zwikker, 2001). Research indicates that when individuals feel confident that they are able to assist in the situation at hand, they are more likely to engage in intervention. This confidence can stem from factors such as knowing the individual(s) involved, having been trained in the proper response(s), or viewing oneself as a responsible party in the situation (Rabow, Newcomb, Monto, & Hernandez, 1990; Thomas & Seibold, 1995; Hoefnagels & Zwikker, 2001). With this in mind, we ask: ""Does status as a party guest or host impact one's willingness to engage in bystander intervention behaviors?"" This article seeks to examine students' willingness to engage in a variety of methods of intervention at off-campus parties. We hypothesize that party hosts will be more willing to intervene in dangerous or problematic situations than party guests, given that they likely own or inhabit the party location and are more likely than guests to know the other attendees. Further, party hosts report being aware of the legal responsibilities incurred as a result of hosting a party (Jakeman, McClure, & Silver, 2015). This combination of hosts (a) viewing themselves as responsible parties, (b) feeling empowered within their place of residence, and (c) being likely to know or be acquainted with other party attendees provides theoretical support for the hypothesis....

Prognostic value of a gene signature in clear cell renal cell carcinoma.,"Renal cancer is aÂ common urogenital system malignance. Novel biomarkers could provide more and more critical information onÂ tumor features and patients' prognosis. Here, we performed an integrated analysis on the discovery set and established a three-gene signature to predict the prognosis for clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). By constructing a LASSO Cox regression model, a 3-messenger RNA (3-mRNA) signature was identified. Based on the 3-mRNA signature, we divided patients into high- and low-risk groups, and validated thisÂ by using three other data sets. In the discovery set, this signature could successfully distinguish between the high- and low-risk patients (hazard ratio (HR), 2.152; 95% confidence interval (CI),1.509-3.069; pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001). Analysis ofÂ internal and two external validation sets yielded consistent results (internal: HR, 2.824; 95% CI, 1.601-4.98; pâ€‰<â€‰0.001; GSE29609: HR, 3.002; 95% CI, 1.113-8.094; pâ€‰=â€‰0.031; E-MTAB-3267: HR, 2.357; 95% CI, 1.243-4.468; pâ€‰=â€‰0.006). Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis indicated that the area under the ROC curve at 5 years was 0.66 both in the discovery and internal validation set, while the two external validation sets also suggested good performance of the 3-mRNA signature. Besides that, a nomogram was built and the calibration plots and decision curve analysis indicated the good performance and clinical utility of the nomogram. In conclusion, this 3-mRNA classifier proved to be a useful tool for prognostic evaluation and could facilitate personalized management of ccRCC patients.",2019,Journal of cellular physiology
Identifying the Prognosis Factors in Death after Liver Transplantation via Adaptive LASSO in Iran,"Despite the widespread use of liver transplantation as a routine therapy in liver diseases, the effective factors on its outcomes are still controversial. This study attempted to identify the most effective factors on death after liver transplantation. For this purpose, modified least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), called Adaptive LASSO, was utilized. One of the best advantages of this method is considering high number of factors. Therefore, in a historical cohort study from 2008 to 2013, the clinical findings of 680 patients undergoing liver transplant surgery were considered. Ridge and Adaptive LASSO regression methods were then implemented to identify the most effective factors on death. To compare the performance of these two models, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used. According to the results, 12 factors in Ridge regression and 9 ones in Adaptive LASSO regression were significant. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of Adaptive LASSO was equal to 89% (95% CI: 86%-91%), which was significantly greater than Ridge regression (64%, 95% CI: 61%-68%) (p < 0.001). As a conclusion, the significant factors and the performance criteria revealed the superiority of Adaptive LASSO method as a penalized model versus traditional regression model in the present study.",2016,Journal of Environmental and Public Health
Identifying pathological subtypes of non-small-cell lung cancer by using the radiomic features of 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission computed tomography,"Background: Radiomics provides promising opportunities in cancer diagnosis, endowing medical imaging with an increasingly important role in analyzing tumor phenotypes. Positron emission computed tomography (PET) imaging can detect functional changes before they become morphologically evident on computed tomography (CT) imaging. The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of using quantitative PET radiomic and clinical features to identify subtypes of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). 
 Methods: In this study, one hundred patients who had been diagnosed with histologically confirmed NSCLC were collected retrospectively, including 61 patients with adenocarcinoma (ADC) and 39 patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC). Then, the gross tumor volume (GTV) was delineated on PET images. A total of 107 features were extracted, which included 60 texture features and 47 metabolic features. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) was used to select the optimal feature set, which was considered to be the best predictable features. Meanwhile, we analyzed the differences of selected features between two tumor types. Classification models were built by multivariable logistic regression analysis with three settings, namely: (I) radiomic features; (II) clinical features (smoking, age, sex, tumor size, T stage and N stage); and (III) radiomic features combined with clinical features. Finally, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the performance of the classification models. 
 Results: Five out of 107 features were selected as the optimal feature set, which included four texture features and one metabolic feature. Significant differences were observed from these five features between ADC and SqCC subtypes (P Conclusions: The 18 F-FDG PET radiomic classification model is a promising and applicable approach for identifying subtypes of NSCLC, which may serve as a complementary tool to help doctors with clinical decisions.",2019,Translational cancer research
Lasso plate - An original implant for fixation of typeÂ I andÂ II Regan-Morrey coronoid fractures.,"INTRODUCTION
Coronoid fractures are notoriously difficult to manage particularly when there is a small fragment. We report a retrospective analysis of our experience with consecutive typeÂ I andÂ II Regan-Morrey coronoid fractures using a lasso plate.


HYPOTHESIS
TypeÂ I andÂ II Regan-Morrey coronoid fractures can be effectively managed using a lasso plate.


METHODS
From OctoberÂ 2011 and DecemberÂ 2013, 25Â patients (21Â males and 4Â females, mean age 40.0Â years) with typeÂ I andÂ II Regan-Morrey coronoid fractures were treated with the open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) using the lasso plate. Postoperative measurements of the elbow range of motion were recorded. Elbow function was evaluated by the Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS) and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score.


RESULTS
All patients were reexamined at a mean follow-up of 32.7Â months (range: 24-49Â months). The mean fractures healing time was 13.6Â weeks (range: 6 to 18Â weeks). The mean flexion range of the elbow was 121.8Â° (range: 90Â° to 135Â°) and the mean extension range of the elbow was 10.6Â° (range: 0Â° to 20Â°). The mean pronation of the forearm was 75.8Â° (range: 65Â° to 85Â°). The mean supination of the forearm was 80.4Â° (range: 70Â° to 90Â°). The mean DASH score was 10.2 (range: 0 to 28). The mean MEPS was 83.4 (range: 55 to 95), 8Â patients (32%) were rated excellent, 14Â patients (56%) were rated good, 2Â (8%) patients were rated fair. One (4%) patient was rated poor. No patient was seriously infected but implant breakage was found in one case. Two cases of elbow heterotopic ossification (HO) were observed. Two cases of elbow medial instability were observed.


DISCUSSION
The typeÂ I andÂ II Regan-Morrey coronoid fractures combined with the instability of the elbow should be operated. The lasso plate reduces the pressure between the wire and the insertion of capsule. A tight wire results in greater stability than ordinary suture fixation, thus enabling early functional exercise.


CONCLUSION
In the treatment of typeÂ I andÂ II Regan-Morrey coronoid fractures, lasso plate can provide concentric fracture reduction of the elbow and stable fixation to allow for early rehabilitation. Good clinical outcomes can be anticipated.

Sparse Estimation of Polynomial and Rational Dynamical Models,"In many practical situations, it is highly desirable to estimate an accurate mathematical model of a real system using as few parameters as possible. At the same time, the need for an accurate description of the system behavior without knowing its complete dynamical structure often leads to model parameterizations describing a rich set of possible hypotheses; an unavoidable choice, which suggests sparsity of the desired parameter estimate. An elegant way to impose this expectation of sparsity is to estimate the parameters by penalizing the criterion with the â„“0 â€œnormâ€ of the parameters. Due to the non-convex nature of the â„“0-norm, this penalization is often implemented as solving an optimization program based on a convex relaxation (e.g., â„“1/LASSO, nuclear norm, . . .). Two difficulties arise when trying to apply these methods: (1) the need to use cross-validation or some related technique for choosing the values of regularization parameters associated with the â„“1 penalty; and (2) the requirement that the (unpenalized) cost function must be convex. To address the first issue, we propose a new technique for sparse linear regression called SPARSEVA, with close ties with the LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator), which provides an automatic tuning of the amount of regularization. The second difficulty, which imposes a severe constraint on the types of model structures or estimation methods on which the â„“1 relaxation can be applied, is addressed by combining SPARSEVA and the Steiglitz-McBride method. To demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach, a solid theoretical analysis and an extensive simulation study are provided.",2014,IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control

Langzeitkrankheitskosten 4Â Jahre nach Schlaganfall oder TIA in Deutschland,"ZusammenfassungHintergrundDer Schlaganfall verursacht nicht nur hohe Akutbehandlungskosten, sondern auch erhebliche Langzeitkosten durch bleibende Behinderung, Arbeitsausfall und Folgeerkrankungen, die bislang nur wenig untersucht wurden.Patienten und MethodenAn einer krankenhausbasierten Kohorte von 151 Patienten mit Schlaganfall oder transitorisch ischÃ¤mischen Attacken (TIA) wurden am Ende des 4.Â Jahres nach Erkrankungsbeginn eine Nachuntersuchung und Befragung durchgefÃ¼hrt. Die Kostenberechnung erfolgte mithilfe eines Bottom-up-Ansatzes. Unterschieden wurden direkte medizinische und nichtmedizinische Kosten, indirekte Kosten sowie Eigenleistungen.ErgebnisseDie schlaganfallunabhÃ¤ngigen Kosten (4610Â±9310Â Euro/Person, Mittelwert Â± Standardabweichung) wurden von den Ã¼brigen Gesamtkosten getrennt. Die schlaganfallassoziierten Gesamtkosten betrugen im 4. Jahr nach Schlaganfall/TIA 7670Â±10250Â Euro pro Patient. Davon waren den direkten Kosten 56% (4320Â±5740Â Euro), den indirekten Kosten 31% (2350Â±2710Â Euro) und den Eigenleistungen 13% (1000Â±4100Â Euro) zuzuordnen. Die in Deutschland entstehenden Langzeitkrankheitskosten werden auf ca. 3Â Mrd. Euro pro Jahr geschÃ¤tzt.SchlussfolgerungDie betrÃ¤chtlichen Langzeitbehandlungskosten im 4. Jahr nach Schlaganfall/TIA werden zum grÃ¶ÃŸten Teil durch direkte Krankheitskosten hervorgerufen und stellen eine Ã¶konomische Herausforderung fÃ¼r unser Gesundheitswesen dar. Die Patienten sind in erheblichem MaÃŸe an den Kosten durch Eigenleistungen beteiligt.SummaryBackgroundThe economic burden of stroke is considerable. While studies on the costs of acute stroke treatment have been undertaken in Germany, thorough analysis of direct and indirect long-term costs is lacking.Patients and MethodsA hospital-based cohort of 151 consecutive patients with stroke or transient ischemic attacks (TIA) was followed up (medical examination and interview) at the end of the 4thÂ year following the cerebrovascular event. Costs were calculated using a bottom-up approach and classified into direct medical and nonmedical costs, indirect costs, and patientsâ€™ costs.ResultsNon-stroke-related costs (mean Â± standard deviation 4,610Â±9,310Â Euros/person) were separated from total costs. Total stroke-related costs of the 4thÂ year after stroke/TIA amounted to 7,670Â±10,250Â Euros per person. The cost components were as follows: direct costs 56% (4,320Â±5,740Â Euros), indirect costs 31% (2,350Â±2,710Â Euros), and patientsâ€™ payments 13% (1,000Â±4,100Â Euros). The annual nationwide costs for the 4thÂ year following stroke or TIA amounted to approximately 3Â billionÂ Euros.ConclusionThe considerable size of long-term costs after stroke/TIA is mainly due to direct costs and poses an economic challenge to the German health care system. Patients contribute in a relevant way by their own payments.",2008,Der Nervenarzt
Sperm alterations in the Vesper mouse Calomys laucha exposed to soil contaminated with crude oil,"Calomys laucha (small vesper mouse) is a small wild rodent that lives in the southern coastal dunes of Brazil, where it feeds and builds nests for breeding, and this lifestyle makes it susceptible to the impacts of human activities in coastal and marine regions. This study aimed to evaluate the some reproductive parameters of C. laucha males in a simulated oil spill. The animals were exposed for 14 days to artificial soil contaminated by petroleum in different concentrations (0, 1, 2, 4 and 8% v / v) and after this period the animals were killed and the testis and epididymis removed for analysis. Exposure did not affect the weight of the testes, but it caused a decrease in sperm viability and an increase in the presence of sperm abnormalities, in particular the â€œlasso-like foldâ€ anomaly (in this case a dose-dependent effect). This study demonstrated that exposure to soil contaminated by crude oil causes damage to the spermatozoa of C. laucha, which may influence the fitness of populations of this species.",2018,
