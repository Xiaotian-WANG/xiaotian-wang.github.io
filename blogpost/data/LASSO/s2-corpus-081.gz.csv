"" RESUMEN:
El tema alrededor del que se construye esta tesis es el diagnostico de las competencias que se desarrollan a lo largo de la formacion universitaria en una titulacion a partir del analisis de sus practicas evaluativas.
El problema, que se define a Quimica, se desglosa en dos objetivos: 1) Identificar el modelo evaluativo de la ensenanza, para 2) diagnosticar las competencias que se desprenden de este modelo. La tesis subyacente al modelo de diagnostico propuesto es que el analisis del modelo evaluativo de una titulacion permite tener evidencias de la consecucion del perfil de formacion, en tanto que este modelo sea coherente con el perfil de formacion pretendido.
La tesis utiliza una metodologia cualitativa y responde al diseno de una investigacion no experimental de corte descriptivo-interpretativo. El trabajo de campo se estructuro en dos fases consecutivas: en una primera, se llevaron a cabo cuatro grupos de discusion con estudiantes (uno por cada curso academico), y, en una segunda, se realizaron entrevistas con 22 profesores de la ensenanza.

Consecuentemente, en la ensenanza de Quimica de la UB, se puede afirmar que las competencias asumidas son evaluadas (y por tanto, certificadas); ahora bien, no se puede certificar el desarrollo de las competencias no asumidas en el perfil.""
SUMMARY:
This thesis is based on the diagnosis of the competences developed through the university training in a degree from the analysis of its assessment practices.
The problem, which is described in Chemistry, breaks down into two goals: 1) Identifying the assessment model of the degree, in order to 2) diagnose the competences that gather from it. The underlying thesis to the diagnosis model proposed is that the analysis of a degree assessment model allows to have evidence of the fulfilment of the education profile, as long as this model is coherent/consistent with the education profile expected.
The thesis uses a qualitative methodology and obeys to the design of a non experimental descriptive - interpretative (type) research. The fieldwork was structured in two consecutive phases: the first one, four focus groups were carried out with students (one for every academic course), and, the second one, interviews were carried out with 22 teachers of the degree. These data have been triangulated with the ones obtained from another research in which employers of the chemical area were interviewed.
In the first part of the thesis, a careful analysis of the construct of competences within the context of higher education is made, as well as the education/training strategies are outlined, especially the assessment strategies consistent with the construct of competences. Likewise, it is offered a reflection on the main challenges of the scientific education and the referents of the Chemistry graduate education profile (British Benchmarks, Project Tuning and White Book of the ANECA).
In the second part, the results are described and the conclusions are presented. The results analyze the education profile assumed by the teaching staff interviewed, the assessed content and the used form of assessment. The main conclusions are the following ones: 1) there is an initial disparity between the assumed education profile and that of the analyzed referents, as well as what gathers from the construct of transferable competences; 2) There is consistence/coherence between the assumed education profile and the contents which are assessed; 3) The assessment practices are consistent with the goals or contents which are assessed. Consequently, in the Chemistry degree of the University of Barcelona, it can be stated that the assumed competences are evaluated (and therefore, certified); however, the profile gaps (as for example, the interpersonal competences) are not certified in this degree.",2005,
Detecting rare and common haplotype-environment interaction under uncertainty of gene-environment independence assumption.,"Finding rare variants and gene-environment interactions (GXE) is critical in dissecting complex diseases. We consider the problem of detecting GXE where G is a rare haplotype and E is a nongenetic factor. Such methods typically assume G-E independence, which may not hold in many applications. A pertinent example is lung cancer-there is evidence that variants on Chromosome 15q25.1 interact with smoking to affect the risk. However, these variants are associated with smoking behavior rendering the assumption of G-E independence inappropriate. With the motivation of detecting GXE under G-E dependence, we extend an existing approach, logistic Bayesian LASSO, which assumes G-E independence (LBL-GXE-I) by modeling G-E dependence through a multinomial logistic regression (referred to as LBL-GXE-D). Unlike LBL-GXE-I, LBL-GXE-D controls type I error rates in all situations; however, it has reduced power when G-E independence holds. To control type I error without sacrificing power, we further propose a unified approach, LBL-GXE, to incorporate uncertainty in the G-E independence assumption by employing a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo method. Our simulations show that LBL-GXE has power similar to that of LBL-GXE-I when G-E independence holds, yet has well-controlled type I errors in all situations. To illustrate the utility of LBL-GXE, we analyzed a lung cancer dataset and found several significant interactions in the 15q25.1 region, including one between a specific rare haplotype and smoking.",2017,Biometrics
Water and health: a forgotten connection?,"There are frequent and doom-laden messages concerning impending water shortages but the consequential negative effects on the availability of waters for healing and the factors underlying the decline in the use of water therapies in some parts of the world are ignored. This article reviews the evidence for the medicinal uses of water, past and present, showing how ancient Egyptian, Greek, Roman, Celtic and Hebrew societies all used water for medicinal purposes, sometimes in conjunction with herbal medicine. Water treatments consisted of hydrotherapy (techniques of therapeutic bathing and use of water), balneotherapy (therapeutic bathing in medicinal and thermal springs) and thalassotherapy (the therapeutic use of ocean bathing and marine products) and these treatments continue to be used to the present day although their use in the Anglo-Saxon world is diminised. Factors in this decline are the lack of research funding and the availability of allopathic medicine. In ancient society, the factors underlying the efficacious healing properties of water may have been ignored and its benefits instead attributed to divine sources. Latterday science, however, from the 19th century to the present, has isolated those factors in water that have health-giving properties.",2010,Perspectives in public health
Polyphonic keyboard accompaniment in the early Baroque: an alternative to basso continuo,"B ASSO continuo and the style period to which it belongs were conjoined early in this century when Hugo Riemann coined the term Generalbafizeitalter, the Thoroughbass Era.1 Basso continuo has indeed become integral to our conception of Baroque style, and with few exceptions pervades modern-day performances of Baroque music. It would seem, however, that in establishing neat stylistic boundaries for the Baroque as the Thoroughbass Period, scholars have largely neglected, and on occasion suppressed, an alternative and concurrent method of accompaniment-namely, polyphonic accompaniment from intabulation or score. In judging from most modern accounts of Baroque music, the popularity of the basso continuo was virtually instantaneous, its application universal, its success unequivocal. Once established, basso continuo soon exceeded its original functional designation and became fashionably de rigueur, as prima prattica works of the 16th century were reissued with redundant but stylish continuo parts. In 1619, for example, an edition of four 16th-century Masses (three by Palestrina, one by Giovanni Francesco Anerio) was published with figured basses, and was warmly enough received that it was reprinted several times before the end of the century.2 In Germany the Promptuarium musicum, a three-volume anthology of ecclesiastical works written in the prima prattica, was compiled by the Speyer school rector Abraham Schadaeus and published at Strasbourg between 1611 and 1613.3 Caspar Vincentius, who at the time was active as Speyer's civic organist and as Schadaeus's collaborator, prepared a supplementary volume containing a figured bass part for the motets. A fourth volume with figured bass was prepared by Vincentius in 1617, and in 1625 he saw fit to prepare and publish at Wtirzburg a figured bass part for Orlande de Lassus's Magnum opus musicum.4 In his prefacing remarks to the work, Vincentius notes that the practice of adding basso continuo to polyphonic music in this manner had become common throughout Italy and Germany.5 While the thought of recasting Palestrina and Lasso in a Baroque mould may cause some consternation, similar feelings of ambivalence towards basso continuo existed in the 17th century. In the second volume of his Il transilvano (Venice, 1609), Girolamo Diruta directs his organ students towards the sedulous study of ricercares, canzonas, Masses, motets and madrigals with the hope that they might thereby attain the highest level of expertise in playing the organ.6 Diruta recommends that organists copy polyphonic compositions into score and play as many of the vocal parts as possible. His pupils were advised in particular against accompanying from a figured bass, because figures, to his mind, were incapable of reliably indicating in which part of a polyphonic texture the consonances and dissonances occur.7 In the Conclusioni del suono del Organo (Bologna, 1609), Adriano Banchieri concurs fully with Diruta:",1998,Early Music
Direct interaction network and differential network inference from compositional data via lasso penalized D-trace loss,"The development of high-throughput sequencing technologies for 16S rRNA gene profiling provides higher quality compositional data for microbe communities. Inferring the direct interaction network under a specific condition and understanding how the network structure changes between two different environmental or genetic conditions are two important topics in biological studies. However, the compositional nature and high dimensionality of the data are challenging in the context of network and differential network recovery. To address this problem in the present paper, we proposed two new loss functions to incorporate the data transformations developed for compositional data analysis into D-trace loss for network and differential network estimation, respectively. The sparse matrix estimators are defined as the minimizer of the corresponding lasso penalized loss. Our method is characterized by its straightforward application based on the ADMM algorithm for numerical solution. Simulations show that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in network and differential network inference under different scenarios. Finally, as an illustration, our method is applied to a mouse skin microbiome data.",2019,PLoS ONE
Supervised dynamic mode decomposition via multitask learning,"Abstract Understanding dynamical systems by extracting spatiotemporal patterns from data is fundamental in a variety of fields of engineering and science. Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) has recently attracted attention in these fields as a way of obtaining a global modal description of a nonlinear dynamical system from data, without requiring explicit prior knowledge. However, DMD is in principle an unsupervised dimensionality reduction algorithm; it is not endowed with the mechanism to utilize label information even if a set of data with different labels is given. In this paper, we propose the algorithm that incorporates label information into DMD via multitask learning by solving sparse-group Lasso. To this end, we estimate sparse weights over dynamic modes in a label-wise manner by regarding data with different labels as different tasks. Modal descriptions estimated by this approach share a part of the global modes, resulting in the extraction of label-specific and common (or mixed) dynamical structures, which could be useful in understanding mechanisms in the spatiotemporal behavior behind data. We investigate the empirical performance using synthetic and real-world datasets, and validate that our algorithm can extract and visualize common and label-specific spatiotemporal structures.",2019,Pattern Recognit.

Comparing high-dimensional confounder control methods for rapid cohort studies from electronic health records,"AIMS
Electronic health records (EHR), containing rich clinical histories of large patient populations, can provide evidence for clinical decisions when evidence from trials and literature is absent. To enable such observational studies from EHR in real time, particularly in emergencies, rapid confounder control methods that can handle numerous variables and adjust for biases are imperative. This study compares the performance of 18 automatic confounder control methods.


METHODS
Methods include propensity scores, direct adjustment by machine learning, similarity matching and resampling in two simulated and one real-world EHR datasets.


RESULTS & CONCLUSIONS
Direct adjustment by lasso regression and ensemble models involving multiple resamples have performance comparable to expert-based propensity scores and thus, may help provide real-time EHR-based evidence for timely clinical decisions.",2016,Journal of Comparative Effectiveness Research
A Lasso-LS Optimization with a Frequency Variable Dictionary in a Multizone Sound System,"This paper presents an approach for multizone wideband sound field generation using an efficient harmonic nested (EHN) dictionary for sparse loudspeakers' placement and weight. Effectively, the nested arrays provide a priori knowledge of prospective loudspeaker locations based on the frequency bands of interest. The nested arrays are then further optimized in the Lasso stage to form an efficient loudspeakers' location dictionary. The final loudspeaker locations and weightings are estimated by a two-stage Lasso-LS pressure matching optimization. In the first stage Lasso algorithm, the center band frequencies of octave bands from 1 kHz to 8 kHz were used to select active loudspeakers. A second stage then optimizes reproduction using all selected loudspeakers on the basis of a regularized LS algorithm. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach provides a solution for the multizone sound system with the mean squared error (MSE) under -30 dB across the targeted frequency range (500 Hz16 kHz) using a linear array e.g. 13 loudspeakers. While, the single-stage LS approach generates the MSE peaks of -10 dB and -9 dB at 9 kHz within the active and silent zones respectively using an identical number of loudspeakers and array length.",2016,"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing"
Prospects and Potential Uses of Genomic Prediction of Key Performance Traits in Tetraploid Potato,"Genomic prediction is a routine tool in breeding programs of most major animal and plant species. However, its usefulness for potato breeding has not yet been evaluated in detail. The objectives of this study were to (i) examine the prospects of genomic prediction of key performance traits in a diversity panel of tetraploid potato modeling additive, dominance, and epistatic effects, (ii) investigate the effects of size and make up of training set, number of test environments and molecular markers on prediction accuracy, and (iii) assess the effect of including markers from candidate genes on the prediction accuracy. With genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP), BayesA, BayesCÏ€, and Bayesian LASSO, four different prediction methods were used for genomic prediction of relative area under disease progress curve after a Phytophthora infestans infection, plant maturity, maturity corrected resistance, tuber starch content, tuber starch yield (TSY), and tuber yield (TY) of 184 tetraploid potato clones or subsets thereof genotyped with the SolCAP 8.3k SNP array. The cross-validated prediction accuracies with GBLUP and the three Bayesian approaches for the six evaluated traits ranged from about 0.5 to about 0.8. For traits with a high expected genetic complexity, such as TSY and TY, we observed an 8% higher prediction accuracy using a model with additive and dominance effects compared with a model with additive effects only. Our results suggest that for oligogenic traits in general and when diagnostic markers are available in particular, the use of Bayesian methods for genomic prediction is highly recommended and that the diagnostic markers should be modeled as fixed effects. The evaluation of the relative performance of genomic prediction vs. phenotypic selection indicated that the former is superior, assuming cycle lengths and selection intensities that are possible to realize in commercial potato breeding programs.",2018,Frontiers in Plant Science
Prendre en compte le profil gÃ©nÃ©tique des patients dans la pharmacocinÃ©tique : quelles mÃ©thodes en analyse de population ?,"La pharmacogenetique (PGt) etudie la part de la variabilite interindividuelle dans la reponse aux traitements expliquee par des variations genetiques. La PGt relie les genotypes de substitutions nucleotidiques a la variabilite pharmacocinetique (PK) dâ€™un medicament.

Il nâ€™existe pas de consensus sur la methodologie pour etudier lâ€™effet de la genetique sur la PK, notamment lors du developpement clinique de medicaments. Nous evaluons et comparons les methodes dâ€™analyse PGt dans les etudes PK en phases precoces du developpement, afin de proposer des approches ameliorant la detection des effets genetiques. Dans une premiere serie de simulations basee sur un exemple reel, nous comparons differentes methodes utilisees en PGt afin de detecter lâ€™effet simule de plusieurs variants genetiques : les methodes pour estimer le phenotype PK (analyse non compartimentale et modeles non lineaires a effets mixtes (MNLEM)) ; les methodes dâ€™association (approche iterative et trois regressions penalisees : regression ridge, Lasso et HyperLasso). Dans une seconde etude de simulation nous proposons des protocoles dâ€™etude pour augmenter la puissance de detection des variants genetiques. Enfin nous evaluons par simulations dans une troisieme etude une approche pour corriger la regression vers la moyenne des phenotypes PK estimes par MNLEM qui entraine une diminution de la puissance de detection des variants genetiques. A travers ces differentes etudes de simulations, nous proposons des recommandations pour les analyses PGt lors dâ€™etude PK dans le developpement du medicament.",2016,
Gradient lasso for Cox proportional hazards model,"MOTIVATION
There has been an increasing interest in expressing a survival phenotype (e.g. time to cancer recurrence or death) or its distribution in terms of a subset of the expression data of a subset of genes. Due to high dimensionality of gene expression data, however, there is a serious problem of collinearity in fitting a prediction model, e.g. Cox's proportional hazards model. To avoid the collinearity problem, several methods based on penalized Cox proportional hazards models have been proposed. However, those methods suffer from severe computational problems, such as slow or even failed convergence, because of high-dimensional matrix inversions required for model fitting. We propose to implement the penalized Cox regression with a lasso penalty via the gradient lasso algorithm that yields faster convergence to the global optimum than do other algorithms. Moreover the gradient lasso algorithm is guaranteed to converge to the optimum under mild regularity conditions. Hence, our gradient lasso algorithm can be a useful tool in developing a prediction model based on high-dimensional covariates including gene expression data.


RESULTS
Results from simulation studies showed that the prediction model by gradient lasso recovers the prognostic genes. Also results from diffuse large B-cell lymphoma datasets and Norway/Stanford breast cancer dataset indicate that our method is very competitive compared with popular existing methods by Park and Hastie and Goeman in its computational time, prediction and selectivity.

Retrospective Parental Rejection Is Associated With Aggressive Behavior as Well as Cognitive Distortions in Forensic Psychiatric Outpatients,"Objective: Parental rejection in childhood is associated with the increased risk of aggression in adulthood and is thought to contribute to the development of inaccurate beliefs regarding own or othersâ€™ behavior (i.e., cognitive distortion) as well. Different forms of aggression are thought to be linked to different types of cognitive distortions. This, however, is unclear in adults. Additionally, it is unknown if parental rejection predicts the presence of aggression and cognitive distortions in adults displaying severe aggression. Method: One hundred twenty-three adult forensic psychiatric outpatients with aggression regulation problems were recruited. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) regression analysis and path analyses were conducted to investigate distinct patterns of cognitive distortions, as measured by use of the How I Think Questionnaire, and the role of perceived parental rejection, as measured by use of the Parental Rejection and Acceptance Questionnaire. Results: Cognitive distortions related to opposition-defiance (e.g., disrespecting rules) and to physical aggression were most strongly associated with the disposition to act aggressively. Furthermore, a direct association was found between parental rejection and this current disposition. This association was partially mediated by cognitive distortions related to opposition-defiance. Conclusion: The current study supports the notion that parental rejection has profound consequences on adult behavior. Acknowledgment of the impact of cognitive distortions on current aggression might be of importance for treatment. A stronger focus on altering distinct cognitive distortions may be more successful in reducing aggression.",2017,Psychology of Violence
Sparse Covariance Fitting Method for Direction of Arrival Estimation of Uncorrelated Wideband Signals,"We propose a new direction of arrival estimation method for wideband uncorrelated signals. The wideband signals are first decomposed into narrowband signals. A group sparse Lasso formulation is proposed that jointly fits the powers of the signals using overcomplete dictionaries of the directions of arrival, into the estimated covariance matrices for all narrowband signals. Then, we propose a new formulation that determines the regularization parameters and becomes the group Lasso formulation. Additionally, we propose a modified algorithm for direction of arrival estimation with lower complexity that uses conventional based methods in the preprocessing stage to reduce the number of variables in the optimization task. We compare the performance of the proposed method to the conventional methods for a circular antenna array.",2014,

"Electrocardiography of a Top Athlete in Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso","Elite sport results in electrocardiogram changes. Some are minor, others are likely to cause sudden death. The authors intended to describe the electrocardiogram features of top athletes at rest in Bobo-Dioulasso. This descriptive transversal study was carried out from August 2015 to February 2016 in the cardiology department of CHU Sanou Souro in Bobo-Dioulasso. The study sampled top athletes aged 17 to 35 with at least eight hoursâ€™ training per week for more than six months regardless of the type of discipline. Two hundred top-level athletes from 4 sport disciplines were included. The median age of athletes was 24 years (IIQ: 21 -27). The median duration in high level sport was 6 years (IIQ: 4 - 8) and the median length of weekly training sessions was 10 hours (IIQ: 10 - 10). Only 4% of the athletes had already conducted an Electrocardiogram (ECG). ECG abnormalities were reported in 90.5% of cases and sinus bradycardia was the most common abnormality reported in 72.5% of cases. Left ventricular and left atrial hypertrophy were reported in 44% and 34.5% of cases respectively. Early repolarization syndrome was registered in 47% of cases. Practicing top-level sport activity can result in electrical changes with athletes. These changes need to be identified by practitioners so that the can differentiate them from heart diseases.",2019,World Journal of Cardiovascular Diseases
Monte Carlo Approximation of Bayes Factors via Mixing with Surrogate Distributions,"By mixing the posterior distribution with a surrogate distribution, of which the normalizing constant is tractable, we describe a new method to estimate the normalizing constant using the Wang-Landau algorithm. We then introduce an accelerated version of the proposed method using the momentum technique. In addition, several extensions are discussed, including (1) a parallel variant, which inserts a sequence of intermediate distributions between the posterior distribution and the surrogate distribution, to further improve the efficiency of the proposed method; (2) the use of the surrogate distribution to help detect potential multimodality of the posterior distribution, upon which a better sampler can be designed utilizing mode jumping algorithms; (3) a new jumping mechanism for general reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms that combines the Multiple-try Metropolis and the directional sampling algorithm, which can be used to estimate the normalizing constant when a surrogate distribution is difficult to come by. We illustrate the proposed methods on several statistical models, including the Log-Gaussian Cox process, the Bayesian Lasso, the logistic regression, the Gaussian mixture model, and the g-prior Bayesian variable selection.",2019,arXiv: Computation
Analyzing Falling Weight Deflectometer Data on Curled and Warped Concrete Slabs,"Falling weight deflectometer testing (FWD) is a non-destructive testing method for pavements, which involves measuring the response of a pavement to a a falling weight. For jointed plain concrete pavements (JPCP), the response of the pavement to the FWD load can be used to backcalculate the pavement layer properties, estimate the performance of the joints, and detect voids. Temperature and moisture gradients in the concrete layer of JPCPs induce curvature in the slab, altering the support conditions of the slab throughout the day. This change in support condition can have a significant effect on FWD testing results. 
A combination of computational analyses, interpretation of field trials, and statistical analysis was used to evaluate the effect of slab curvature when interpreting FWD data. It was determined that backcalculation of the modulus of subgrade reaction (k-value), is sensitive to slab curvature, if the equivalent linear temperature gradient (ELTG) in the slab is less than 0.5 Â°F/in especially. for pavements with stiff supporting layers. A backcalculation procedure was developed to backcalculate the modulus of subgrade reaction using FWD testing when positive temperature gradients are present. The measured load transfer efficiency (LTE) for doweled JPCP slabs was found to be at a minimum when the slab is approximately flat and increase as a positive or negative temperature gradient develops. The measured differential deflection for doweled slabs was found to be at a maximum when the slab is approximately flat or with a negative temperature gradient, depending on the condition of the dowels. A void detection model for doweled JPCP pavements was developed using LASSO logistic regression, which outperforms currently available void detection techniques. Finally, a temperature prediction model was developed, which predicts the pavement temperature profile as a function of the weather conditions. The developed models are all packaged in the University of Pittsburgh FWD Analysis of Concretes Slabs (PITT-FACS) web tool, so that they can easily be used by practitioners.",2019,

De 2005Â a 2009, le centre regional de transfusion sanguine de Bobo-Dioulasso a ainsi conduit une experience pilote de mise en place dâ€™un systeme dâ€™hemovigilance. Methodes Les etapes de mise en Å“uvre de ce systeme comprenaient une formation du personnel medical et paramedical des etablissements de soins approvisionnes par le centre regional de transfusion sanguine, la diffusion de fiches post-transfusionnelles et dâ€™hemovigilance, enfin la creation dâ€™un comite de securite transfusionnelle et dâ€™hemovigilance. Resultats Au cours de la periode 2005â€“2009, 34Â 729Â produits sanguins ont ete distribues pour un total de 23Â 418Â malades transfuses. Le taux de retour des fiches post-transfusionnelles et dâ€™hemovigilance (nombre de fiches remplies, completement ou non, et retournees au centre regional de transfusion sanguine par rapport au nombre de produits delivres) est passe de 83,1Â a 94,8Â %, le taux de tracabilite (taux de fiches retournees et remplies completement) de 71,6Â a 91,6Â % et la concordance entre le receveur programme et le receveur effectif des produits sanguins de 92,9Â a 98,0Â %. Le taux de notification des incidents transfusionnels est passe de 1,1Â a 16,1Â pour 1000Â produits transfuses au cours de la periode. Conclusion La mise en place dâ€™un systeme dâ€™hemovigilance est possible dans les pays dâ€™Afrique subsaharienne. Elle constitue un element majeur de lâ€™amelioration des differents volets de la securite transfusionnelle. Cette mise en place, qui doit passer par une negociation entre les centres de transfusion et le personnel hospitalier, devrait etre encouragee par lâ€™existence dâ€™une reglementation officielle en matiere de transfusion sanguine.",2012,Transfusion Clinique Et Biologique
A Sparse Decomposition of Democracy and Trade In,"Do trading partnersâ€™ political institutions matter in international trade? In answering this question, researchers typically relate aggregate measures of institutional structure with total volumes of bilateral trade, while pairs that do not trade are excluded from the analysis. This common approach blurs important distinctions between institutional impacts on the selection of trade partners (the extensive margin) and the volume of trade (the intensive margin), while it engenders selection bias. This paper overcomes these problems. First, it decomposes the widely used Polity IV measure into its components to identify political institutions that are trade promoting. Second, we propose a two-stage Bayesian LASSO estimator to deal with the twin problems of selection and multicollinearity that are pervasive in the use of gravity equations in empirical studies of international trade. We find that political institutions matter more in the extensive margin than in the intensive margin of trade. We also find that democratic political institutions are not always promoting. Specifically, we find that while trade appears to be fostered by political stability, it may actually be a means of circumventing the kleptocratic tendencies of hereditary rule. We identify heterogeneous effects of both the standard gravity variables and the polity variables varying across industries and time, with a notably recent tendency for some aspects of the longstanding democracies: party competition and institutional durability, to inhibit trade.",2016,
Processes Influencing Recruitment Inferred from Distributions of Coral Reef Fishes,"To determine the relative impact of oceanographic vs. benthic processes on recruitment of coral reef fi shes to back reef lagoon nursery habitats, we examined the distributions of small fi shes (recruits 5 cm) of fi ve fi sh taxa at six, 16-ha lagoons of St. Croix, USVI. Since all habitats of a location are infl uenced by the same oceanographic events, it was hypothesized that rankings of recruit densities on the same habitat types across different lagoons should be similar if oceanographic processes have a dominant infl uence on recruitment. Concordance analysis of recruit densities produced no evidence of consistent amongsite differences. It was hypothesized that consistent rankings of habitats within lagoons (e.g., density of post-settlers on rubble habitat ranked higher than seagrass habitat within all lagoons), indicated post-settlement benthic processes were more infl uential. Differential use of habitat by recruits was consistent among lagoons and over 2 yrs of study. Patterns of habitat use by juveniles were different from the patterns of recruits. Acanthurus spp. and Haemulon spp. moved from the lagoon (nursery habitats) to the reef (adult habitat), and densities of large fi shes of these species on back reefs were strongly related to the availability of nursery habitat in adjacent lagoons. These ontogenetic changes in habitat use indicate continuing infl uence of benthic processes. This publication is part in a series of papers resulting from a scientifi c workshop held at the Caribbean Marine Research Center (December 2001) to evaluate the importance of back reef systems for supporting biodiversity and productivity of marine ecosystems. The life history of most coral reef fi shes is a two-phase cycle that decouples local reproduction from recruitment of new individuals into the local population. Juveniles and adults are demersal while larvae are planktonic. Furthermore, larvae of many prominent fi sh taxa on coral reefs settle into habitats that are distinct from those of adults (Robertson et al., 1979; Shulman and Ogden, 1987), creating another stage within the demersal phase of life history. Thus, for many coral reef fi shes, the life history includes three stages; larval (planktonic), juvenile (demersal), and adult (demersal) â€“ further complicating population dynamics. Oceanographic processes may determine settlement patterns of coral reef fi shes by transporting and infl uencing the survival of larvae (Choat et al., 1988). For example, for some species in Barbados, the occurrence of late stage larvae in traps corresponded with the fi rst appearance of juveniles on reefs, suggesting that larval supply was a good indicator of settlement (Sponaugle and Cowen, 1996). Moreover, larvae of some species [e.g., Stegastes partitus (Poey, 1868) and Acanthurus bahianus (Castelnau, 1855)] were consistently associated spatially and temporally, suggesting these species were infl uenced similarly by oceanographic processes such as prevailing currents, tidal currents, wind-induced water fl ow, and large-scale externally forced events. However, mixed results from recent studies of recruitment at multiple spatial scales demonstrate the complexity of processes infl uencing larval supply, settlement, and postsettlement densities. Signifi cant spatial trends in settlement for Thalassoma bifasciatum (Bloch, 1791) were attributed to oceanographic infl uences by Caselle and Warner (1996).",2004,
Urban MV and LV Distribution Grid Topology Estimation via Group Lasso,"The increasing penetration of distributed energy resources poses numerous reliability issues to the urban distribution grid. The topology estimation is a critical step to ensure the robustness of distribution grid operation. However, the bus connectivity and grid topology estimation are usually hard in distribution grids. For example, it is technically challenging and costly to monitor the bus connectivity in urban grids, e.g., underground lines. It is also inappropriate to use the radial topology assumption exclusively because the grids of metropolitan cities and regions with dense loads could be with many mesh structures. To resolve these drawbacks, we propose a data-driven topology estimation method for medium voltage (MV) and low voltage (LV) distribution grids by only utilizing the historical smart meter measurements. Particularly, a probabilistic graphical model is utilized to capture the statistical dependencies amongst bus voltages. We prove that the bus connectivity and grid topology estimation problems, in radial and mesh structures, can be formulated as a linear regression with a least absolute shrinkage regularization on grouped variables (group lasso). Simulations show highly accurate results in eight MV and LV distribution networks at different sizes and 22 topology configurations using Pacific Gas and Electric Company residential smart meter data.",2019,IEEE Transactions on Power Systems

Beliefs and practices: diarrhoeas and hygiene practices in Burkina Faso,"Une etude pluridisciplinaire a ete menee dans la ville de Bobo-Dioulasso au Burkina Faso. Lâ€™etude visait a identifier des interventions pour le controle des maladies diarrheiques chez les enfants. Une combinaison de methodes qualitatives et quantitatives a permis dâ€™explorer les croyances et pratiques des meres, en relation avec les diarrhees. Dix causes differentes ou ensembles de causes de la diarrhee ont ete recenses, entre autres, la dentition, les candidoses buccales et la transgression de lâ€™interdit sexuel postnatal. Des pratiques susceptibles de favoriser la contamination fecale-orale ont ete identifiees : 32 % des selles des enfants nâ€™aboutissent pas dans des latrines, soit que la defecation ait lieu a meme le sol, soit que les selles faites dans un pot ou dans un linge soient jetees en plein air. Les mains des meres sont quotidiennement en contact avec les selles des enfants lors du nettoyage a lâ€™eau de lâ€™anus de lâ€™enfant apres la defecation ; ces contacts sont rarement suivis de lavage de mains au savon. Plusieurs facteurs peuvent expliquer la persistance de telles pratiques et il sera difficile de les changer. Neanmoins, il semble que les informations sanitaires sur la prevention de la diarrhee soient insuffisantes, en partie parce quâ€™elles ne renseignent pas les meres sur le risque le plus important dans leur situation (les voies de transmission fecale-orale des pathogenes de la diarrhee). Une meilleure conception des messages dâ€™Education pour la Sante qui identifierait les pratiques a risque et les croyances qui les perennisent ainsi que des efforts nationaux dâ€™assainissement permettront certainement de promouvoir lâ€™hygiene personnelle et domestique.",1994,
Acidic Microenvironment Up-Regulates Exosomal miR-21 and miR-10b in Early-Stage Hepatocellular Carcinoma to Promote Cancer Cell Proliferation and Metastasis,"Rationale: The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma is rising worldwide. It is predicted that nearly half of the early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (E-HCC) patients will develop recurrence. Dysregulated pH, a hallmark of E-HCC, is correlated with poor prognosis. The acidic microenvironment has been shown to promote the release of exosomes, the membrane vesicles recognized as intercellular communicators associated with tumor progression, recurrence, and metastasis. We, therefore, aimed to identify exosomes induced by acidic microenvironment that may regulate E-HCC progression and to explore their mechanisms and clinical significance in E-HCCs. Methods: miRNA microarray analysis and LASSO logistic statistic model were used to identify the main functional exosomal miRNAs. Invasion and scratch assays were performed to examine the migration and invasion of HCC cells. Immunoblotting and immunofluorescence were employed to detect the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in HCC cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was used to analyze the binding of HIF-1Î± and HIF-2Î± to promoter regions of miR-21 and miR-10b. Results: The acidic microenvironment in HCC was correlated with poor prognosis of patients. Exosomes from HCC cells cultured in the acidic medium could promote cell proliferation, migration, and invasion of recipient HCC cells. We identified miR-21 and miR-10b as the most important functional miRNAs in acidic HCC-derived exosomes. Also, the acidic microenvironment triggered the activation of HIF-1Î± and HIF-2Î± and stimulated exosomal miR-21 and miR-10b expression substantially promoting HCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion both in vivo and in vitro. In E-HCC patients, serum exosomal miR-21 and miR-10b levels were associated with advanced tumor stage and HIF-1Î± and HIF-2Î± expression and were independent prognostic factors for disease-free survival of E-HCC patients. Most importantly, we developed a nano-drug to target exosomal miR-21 and/or miR-10b and examined its therapeutic effects against HCC in vivo. Conclusion: Our findings suggested that the exosomal miR-21 and miR-10b induced by acidic microenvironment in HCC promote cancer cell proliferation and metastasis and may serve as prognostic molecular markers and therapeutic targets for HCC.",2019,Theranostics

Influence of Psychiatric and Personality Disorders on Smoking Cessation Among Individuals in Opiate Dependence Treatment,"ABSTRACT Objective: We aimed to evaluate how psychiatric and personality disorders influence smoking cessation goals and attempts among people with opiate dependence who smoke. This information could aid the development of more effective cessation interventions for these individuals. Methods: Participants (N = 116) were recruited from two methadone clinics, completed the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory-III, and were asked about their smoking behavior and quitting goals. We used the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) method, a technique commonly used for studies with small sample sizes and large number of predictors, to develop models predicting having a smoking cessation goal, among those currently smoking daily, and ever making a quit attempt, among those who ever smoked. Results: Almost all participants reported ever smoking (n = 115, 99%); 70% (n = 80) had made a serious quit attempt in the past; 89% (n = 103) reported current daily smoking; and 59% (n = 61) had a goal of quitting smoking and staying off cigarettes. Almost all (n = 112, 97%) had clinically significant characteristics of a psychiatric or personality disorder. White race, anxiety, and a negativistic personality facet (expressively resentful) were negative predictors of having a cessation goal. Overall, narcissistic personality pattern and a dependent personality facet (interpersonally submissive) were positive predictors of having a cessation goal. Somatoform disorder, overall borderline personality pattern, and a depressive personality facet (cognitively fatalistic) were negative predictors of ever making a quit attempt. Individual histrionic (gregarious self-image), antisocial (acting out mechanism), paranoid (expressively defensive), and sadistic (pernicious representations) personality disorder facets were positive predictors of ever making a quit attempt. Each model provided good discrimination for having a smoking cessation goal or not (C-statistic of .76, 95% CI [0.66, 0.85]) and ever making a quit attempt or not (C-statistic of .79, 95% CI [0.70, 0.88]). Conclusions: Compared to existing treatments, smoking cessation treatments that can be tailored to address the individual needs of people with specific psychiatric disorders or personality disorder traits may better help those in opiate dependence treatment to set a cessation goal, attempt to quit, and eventually quit smoking.",2016,Journal of Dual Diagnosis

Primary evidence for Late Roman D Ware production in southern Asia Minor: a challenge to â€˜Cypriot Red Slip Wareâ€™,"Late Roman D Ware (or â€˜Cypriot Red Slip Wareâ€™) is one of the most widespread fine wares of the late antique Mediterranean. Its hypothetical origin in Cyprus is challenged by the discovery since 2008 of kilns in Turkey whose products include the whole of this wareâ€™s standard repertoire. This paper provides the first detailed account of the discovery of a network of seven production centres located near Gebiz, 32km northeast of Antalya and close to the Kestros river (Aksu cayi) and its tributary the Kucukaksu river, from where these products together with agricultural goods would have been traded inland and downstream to Perge and beyond. Results of the field survey during which these kilns were discovered are presented, together with a discussion of their far-reaching implications. The results establish southern Anatolia, and specifically the margins of the Pamphylian plain, as the only certainly identified production area of this ware. By challenging the origin traditionally accepted for â€˜Cypriot Red Slip Wareâ€™, which is distributed throughout the eastern Mediterranean, the discovery of these kilns raises questions also about other less archaeologically distinct Anatolian goods which also are likely to have been involved in this exchange network at both local and international scales.

One cannot argue from production sites in Anatolia that similar products were not made also on Cyprus, but since so much material in similar forms is recorded on Cyprus, whether it was made there or not, one can be sure that Cyprus and southern Asia Minor must have been very closely inter-related culturally and must have been actively trading in ceramics and other products on a scale not previously appreciated. Furthermore, this discovery prompts scholars working at sites all over the eastern Mediterranean region, including Libya, Egypt, Palestine, Syria and along the southern coast of Turkey, to question whether southern Turkey and not Cyprus was in fact the origin of much of their Late Roman D Ware material. An implication of this is that other less durable goods also might have followed the same trade routes as the pottery which has survived to form part of the archaeological record. The discovery of these production sites therefore has significant implications for the understanding of the late Roman economy and confirms the importance of the southern Anatolian regions of Pamphylia and Pisidia as places of production much more intensively involved in these trade routes and exchange networks than previously has been acknowledged. Late Roman D Ware has long been known, having first been classified as one of the main red slip wares at Antioch by Waage (1948: 52). Since then, archaeologists and archaeometrists have debated its potential production centre(s). In his seminal book on late Roman pottery, John Hayes tentatively located the origin of Late Roman D Ware on Cyprus because of its distribution on the island and proposed that it should be renamed Cypriot Red Slip Ware (CRSW) (Hayes 1972: 371â€“86). In spite of the fact that scientific analyses of fabrics from Cyprus have argued that Late Roman D Ware correlates broadly with results from geological samples on the island (Rautman 1995), no production centres have been identified on Cyprus (Meyza 2007: 13, 17â€“20; Armstrong 2009: 158). Over the last 20 years Late Roman D Ware has been discovered in large quantities in southern and southwestern Asia Minor (Williams 1989: 27â€“45, 50â€“51; Atik 1995; Firat 2000: 35â€“38; Vroom 2007: 277). The distribution of this ware at sites in Turkey led Poblome et al. to conduct chemical analyses on sherds from Hierapolis, Perge and Sagalassos (2001: 119â€“26). They concluded that production centres must have existed in Asia Minor and the suggestion was acknowledged as a possibility by Hayes (2001: 277). The most extensive study of Late Roman D Ware, by Meyza, begins by acknowledging that its source has yet to be established (Meyza 2007: 13), but despite the fact that by the date of its publication an Anatolian source had been posited, no material from Turkey was inspected for the study which focused on material from Cyprus, Egypt, Libya and Greece (Meyza 2007: 13). This important late Roman red slipped table ware was used from the fourth to the seventh century AD, or through into the eighth or possibly the early ninth as recently proposed by Armstrong (Armstrong 2009); it was traded throughout the eastern Mediterranean and especially in the Levant, on Cyprus and in southern Asia Minor where it was a major competitor to Late Roman A and B Wares from Africa and Late Roman C (Phocean) Red Slipped Ware from western Turkey (Bonifay 2004; Vaag 2005). This paper reports on the recent surveys by the Pisidia Survey Project of production sites in Turkey located 32km northeast of Antalya near Gebiz, whose products include the whole of the standard repertoire of Late Roman D Ware together with other products including cooking pots and amphorae. The discovery of workshops in Turkey of a fine ware which represents a significant part of the ceramic assemblages at sites across the eastern Mediterranean, and which has long been associated with Cyprus, has major implications for the understanding of the economy of the region. The fact that products in very similar forms are found on Cyprus, where they are thought to originate, may mean the products were produced in both regions, but at present the kiln sites only enable us to be certain of production in Turkey. One might question whether these production sites in Turkey are the actual origin of the material found on Cyprus; this will be a topic for further research. Whatever the arguments about the origin of material found at Cypriot consumer sites, the production sites in Anatolia certainly demonstrate that the term â€˜Cypriot Red Slip Wareâ€™ is not appropriate for the Anatolian products, and we suggest that the term â€˜Late Roman D Wareâ€™ (LRDW) should be revived for the time being. The Pisidia Survey Project has aimed to establish the locations of further production sites in the vicinity following the initial discovery of kiln sites in 2008 and to contextualise them within a mutli-disciplinary approach to the region (Vandeput, Kose 2008; 2010; Vandeput et al. 2011; 2012). Of particular importance is the need to establish through petrological and chemical analyses the relationship of the material produced with that from neighbouring sites in Anatolia and Cyprus in order to distinguish whether the material is different from that found at sites on Cyprus; but this scientific study will also benefit from research into the social aspects behind the distribution of the material. Whether the material found on Cyprus comes from undiscovered Cypriot production sites or from these Turkish sites needs to be established, but, for now, one can highlight the close cultural relationship",2012,Anatolian studies
"Sequence stratigraphy of the Raha Formation, Bakr Oil Field, Gulf of Suez, Egypt: Insights from electrical well log and palynological data","Abstract The current paper provides a high resolution sequence stratigraphic study of the Raha Formation from the productive Bakr Oil Field, central Gulf of Suez, Egypt. Sixty cutting rock samples spanning the Cenomanian from three wells (Bakr-114, B-115 and B-109) in the Bakr Basin, were palynologically investigated. The documented palynomorphs assemblage of either terrestrially-derived sporomorphs or marine inhabited dinocysts, allowed two palynological zones as well as their encompassing depositional palaeoenvironment to be recognized. These zones are Afropollis jardinusâ€“Crybelosporites pannuceus Assemblage Zone (early-middle Cenomanian) and Classopollis brasiliensis-Tricolpites sagax Assemblage Zone (late Cenomanian). Detailed analysis of the particulate organic matter compositions suggested that the depositional palaeoenvironment of the Raha Formation was fluctuating between supratidal and distal-inner neritic conditions, due to successive oscillations of the Neo-Tethyan Ocean during the Cenomanian. The pronounced peaks of particulate organic matter versus gamma ray are markedly used in delineating the depositional sequences of the Raha Formation and their bounding surfaces. The Raha Formation probably corresponds to a second-order depositional sequence, which can be further subdivided into eight third-order depositional sequences, of which six are complete and two are incomplete ones. These depositional sequences are significantly synchronized based on a simple 2-D correlation model between the three wells. According to the hierarchical duration system, the Cenomanian herein was approximately attributed to 6 Myr, each of which has lower order depositional sequences that took approximately 0.9 Myr. Based on the sequence stratigraphic approach together with palynofacies analysis and gamma ray data, a condensed section was defined in the B-115.",2018,Journal of African Earth Sciences
Effects of delayed housing of broiler chicks and three different types of waterers on broiler performance.,"The performance of broilers was examined under different days of placement (after hatching) and with three different types of waterers: 1) an automatic satellite waterer; 2) a broiler Plasson waterer; and 3) a regular Plasson waterer with a plastic ring in the trough of the waterer for 3 d. Male broiler chicks (2,106) from a commercial strain were randomly placed in 27 litter floor pens, with 9 pens per day of placement and waterer treatments. The broilers consumed feed and water ad libitum and mortality was recorded. The broilers were weighed at day of placement, at 7 and 49 d from day of placement and at 28 and 49 d from day of hatch. There was a difference in body weight (P < .05) among the broilers on the day of placement, with those on the day of hatch being heavier. There was no difference in body weights or feed conversion taken after the broilers were on feed for 7 and 49 d after placement. The broilers placed on the 3rd d after hatching had a higher (P < .05) mortality rate at 28 d of age than the other two groups. There was no difference in body weight, feed conversion, or mortality within the three different waterer treatments except for the broilers on the Plasson with the ring, which was higher in mortality percentage (P < .05) than the broilers on the broiler Plasson waterer. The broilers placed in the pens with the regular Plasson waterer did not get wet from climbing into the water during the first few days as did the broilers in the pens with the automatic satellite waterer or the Plasson waterer with the ring.",1995,Poultry science

"Middle Jurassic â€“ earliest Late Cretaceous palynofloras, coastal Tanzania - Part One","This Part Two of the current monograph (Msaky 2011) completes the systematic palaeontology and discusses the biostratigraphic and palaeogeographic significance of the palynofloras together with the results of palynofacies analyses. In the systematic section, two new species are established: Pseudoceratium redactum and Sentusidinium tanzaniensis. Six informal, stratigraphically successive, dinoflagellate assemblages are distinguished, as follows: Assemblage I (Bajocianâ€“Bathonian); Assemblage II (Callovian); Assemblage III (Oxfordian); Assemblage IV (Kimmeridgianâ€“Tithonian); Assemblage V (Berriasianâ€“Barremian); and Assemblage VI (Aptianâ€“Cenomanian). Coastal Tanzania appears referable to the Austral dinoflagellate realm due to the presence of, inter alia, Broomea ramosa, Komewuia glabra, Wanaea clathrata, and Wanaea digitata. Some minor biostratigraphic anomalies are noted, including the introduction of Glossodinium dimorphum; this is datable as early Oxfordian in Tanzania whereas in Australasia the species appears earlier (in the Callovian). A few noteworthy quantitative phenomena are evident; for instance, the abundance of Lithodinia jurassica in the vicinity of the Callovianâ€“Oxfordian boundary and the marked increase of Wanaea spp. in the Oxfordian, specifically in the Ruvu Basin of the northern coastal belt. These events are of chronostratigraphic significance and could be applicable to regional correlation. Middleâ€“ Late Jurassic assemblages show a conspicuous degree of cosmopolitanism, and include some species previously considered to be restricted to certain regions in the low and high latitudes. The Early Cretaceous (Berriasianâ€“Barremian) assemblages show close affinity to the Tethyan Realm. The latest Early Cretaceous (Albian) to earliest Late Cretaceous (Cenomanian) strata are allied to the Albianâ€“Cenomanian Elaterates province. The presence of elater-bearing pollen in offshore and onshore sections of Tanzania indicates that the Elaterates had a wider geographic distribution than previously reported: i.e., extending beyond the northern part of the African and South American continents. The lower part of the Kipatimu Formation, which contains Assemblage IV, yielded Komewuia glabra, Broomea ramosa, and Rigaudella aemula and their presence precludes the Early Cretaceous age previously ascribed to this part of the formation. Likewise the Makonde and Mikindani Beds have yielded typically Early Cretaceous pollen grains including Classopollis braziliensis, RetitricolÂ­ pites vulgaris, and Elaterocolpites castelainii. The Jurassic/Cretaceous boundary is coincident with the upper limit of Assemblage IV, based on the last appearances of, in particular, Komewuia glabra and Rigaudella aemula. Within the Kipatimu Formation (as represented in wells SS-5 and SS-7), the systemic boundary appears conformable. But elsewhere in the coastal belt, the boundary is clearly unconformable. On the basis of palynostratigraphic data, significant biostratigraphic events, such as introductions and exits of certain dinoflagellate species commonly match sequence boundaries. From palynofacies analyses and palynostratigraphic data, the Kipatimu Formation is dominated by phytoclasts indicating high terrestrial inputs during its deposition. Abundance of black wood (of high buoyancy) in the majority of samples implies high energy settings and abundance of brown wood (less buoyant) is an indication of a sudden terrestrial input into the marine system. The organic composition of sedimentary rocks is an important means whereby the depositional history of the enclosing sediments can be understood. Different environmental settings clearly influence the character of palynofacies. For example, abundant Authorâ€™s address: Dr. Emma S.

Introduction: Ostial pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) is considered a potentially curative therapeutic approach in the treatment of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF). There is only limited data available on the longterm effect of this procedure. Methods: Patients (Pts.) underwent a regular clinical follow-up visit at 3, 6 and 24 months after PVI. Clinical success was classified as complete (i.e. no arrhythmia recurrences, no antiarrhythmic drug), partial (i.e. no/only few recurrences, on drug) or as a failure (no benefit). The clinical responder rate (CRR) was determined by combining complete and partial success. Results: 117 pts. (96 , 21 ), aged 51 Â± 11 years (range 25â€“73) underwent a total of 166 procedures (1.42/pt.) in 2â€“4 pulmonary veins (PV). 115 pts. (98 %) had AF, 109/115 pts. exhibited PAF as the primary arrhythmia. A total of 113 pts. with PVI in the years 2001 to 2003 were evaluated for their CRR after 6 (3) months. A single intervention was carried out in 63 pts. (55.8 %), two interventions were performed in 45 pts. (39.8 %) and three interventions in 5 pts. (4.4 %). The clinical response demonstrated a complete success of 52 % (59 pts.), a partial success of 26 % (29 pts.) and a failure rate of 22 % (25 pts.), leading to a CRR of 78 % (88 pts.). Ostial PVI in all 4 PVs exhibited a tendency towards higher curative success rates (54 % vs. 44 % in pts. with 3 PVs ablated). Longterm clinical outcome was evaluated in 39 pts. with an ablation attempt at 3 PVs only (excluding the right inferior PV in our early experience) and a mean clinical follow-up of 21 Â± 6 months. At this point in time the success rate was 41 % (complete, 16 pts.) and 21 % (partial, 8 pts.), respectively, adding up to a CRR of 62 % (24 pts.). Conclusion: The CRR of pts. with medical refractory PAF in our patient cohort is 78 % at the 6 month followup. Ablation of all 4 PV exhibits a tendency towards higher complete success rates despite equal CRR. Calculation of the clinical response after a midto longterm follow-up of 21 Â± 6 months in those pts. with an ostial PVI in only 3 pulmonary veins (sparing the right inferior PV) shows a further reduction to 62 %, exclusively caused by a drop in pts. with a former partial success. To evaluate the longterm clinical benefit of ostial PVI in comparison with other ablation techniques, more extended follow-up periods are mandatory, including a larger study cohort and a detailed description of procedural parameters.

Consistency tests of the Universe and cosmic relics,"In the last decades, a cosmological model that fits observations through a vast range of scales emerged. It goes under the name of ACDM. However, there are still challenging questions that remain unanswered by this model, such as what causes the observed accelerated expansion of the universe. Hence, many alternative models have been proposed. This thesis concerns an approach to test such models known as â€œEffective Theory of Dark Energyâ€ . It applies to all models where general relativity is modified by adding a single scalar degree of freedom, called â€œ scalar-tensor theoriesâ€. In Chapter 1 I introduce the most general classof such theories currently known. In Chapter 2, I resume the Effective theory of dark energy. The inclusion of a general coupling between matter and the gravitational sector is the subject of Chapter 3. Chapter 4 analyses in details the stability of different classes of theories.Another goal of the thesis is to study the observable effects of deviations from ACDM. In Chapter5, I consider the possibility of an interaction between dark matter and dark energy and I analyse the constraining power of future surveys on the free parameters of the theory. Chapter 6 focuses on the observational effects of theories where a kinetic mixing between matter and the scalar field exists.This gives a peculiar effect, namely the weakening of gravity at large scale structure scales.",2017,
Quantitative Measurement of Oligodendrogliomas Histologica Features inPredicting the 1p/19q Co-Deletion Status,"Oligodendrogliomas are characterized by 1p/19q co-deletion, which generally correlates with subjective morphologic features like nuclei circularity ratio and texture features of the cancer nuclei. As cost control becomes more of an issue in medicine, upfront reflex molecular diagnostic testing for lesions like 1p/19q co-deletion may not be appropriate. This paper aims to develop a rigorous, unbiased digital imaging segmentation algorithm and statistical models that can accurately predict the likelihood of 1p/19q co-deletion based on morphology and texture, which would greatly improve cost-effectiveness in clinic trail. In this study, totally 28 gliomas of haematoxylin and eosin stained slides are comprised in this test cohort. Selected areas that had high tumour cell density were digitally analysed with a high-throughput image segmentation algorithm to automatically delineate the boundaries of the cell nuclei. Then we extracted the morphologic features and texture features based on the segmentation result, and applied them in to Lasso-logistic regression to build the correlation between these features with 1p/19q co-deletion status. As a comparison, we also used PAM (Prediction Analysis of Microarrays), RPA (Recursive Partitioning Analysis) to compare the predication performance. We find out that the circularity ratio of the cell, the variance of cell area for each patient, and parts of texture features effect the 1p/19q co-deletion status, and the false prediction rate of leave one out cross validation is at most around 10%. Moreover, we conduct survival analysis and find out two morphologic features and one texture features are significant influential to patientsâ€™ survival time.",2016,Journal of biometrics & biostatistics
An applied analysis of high-dimensional logistic regression,"In the high dimensional setting, we investigate common regularization approaches for fitting logistic regression models with binary response variables. A literature review is provided on generalized linear models, regularization approaches which include the lasso, ridge, elastic net and relaxed lasso, and recent post-selection methods for obtaining p-values of coefficient estimates proposed by Lockhart et. al. and Buhlmann et. al. We consider varying n, p conditions, and assess model performance based on several evaluation metrics such as their sparsity, accuracy and algorithmic time efficiency. Through a simulation study, we find that Buhlmann et. alâ€™s multi sample splitting method performed poorly when selected covariates were highly correlated. When Î» was chosen through cross validation, the elastic net had similar levels of performance as compared to the lasso, but it did not possess the level of sparsity Zou and Hastie have suggested.",2017,
Designing Schemes to Associate Basic Semantics Register with RDF/OWL,"The Basic Semantic Register(BSR) is and official ISO register designed for interoperability among eBusiness and EDI systems. The entities registered in the current BSR are not defined in a machine-understandable way, which renders automatic extraction of structural and relationship information from the register impossible. The purpose of this study is to offer a framework for designing an ontology that can provide semantic interoperability among BSR-based systems by defining data structures and relationships with RDF and OWL, similar meaning by the `equivalentClass` construct in OWL, the hierachical relationships among classes by the `subClassOf` construct in RDF schema, definition of any entities in BSR by the `label` construct in RDF schema, specification of usage guidelines by the `comment` construct in RDF schema, assignment of classes to BSU`s by the `domain` construct in RDF schema, specification of data types of BSU`s by the `range` construct in RDF schema. Hierarchical relationships among properties in BSR can be expressed using the `subPropertyOf` in RDF schema. Progress in semantic interoperability can be expected among BSR-based systems through applications of semantic web technology suggested in this study.",2003,Journal of The Korean Society for Information Management
Protein network-based Lasso regression model for the construction of disease-miRNA functional interactions,"BackgroundThere is a growing body of evidence associating microRNAs (miRNAs) with human diseases. MiRNAs are new key players in the disease paradigm demonstrating roles in several human diseases. The functional association between miRNAs and diseases remains largely unclear and far from complete. With the advent of high-throughput functional genomics techniques that infer genes and biological pathways dysregulted in diseases, it is now possible to infer functional association between diseases and biological molecules by integrating disparate biological information.ResultsHere, we first used Lasso regression model to identify miRNAs associated with disease signature as a proof of concept. Then we proposed an integrated approach that uses disease-gene associations from microarray experiments and text mining, and miRNA-gene association from computational predictions and protein networks to build functional associations network between miRNAs and diseases. The findings of the proposed model were validated against gold standard datasets using ROC analysis and results were promising (AUC=0.81). Our protein network-based approach discovered 19 new functional associations between prostate cancer and miRNAs. The new 19 associations were validated using miRNA expression data and clinical profiles and showed to act as diagnostic and prognostic prostate biomarkers. The proposed integrated approach allowed us to reconstruct functional associations between miRNAs and human diseases and uncovered functional roles of newly discovered miRNAs.ConclusionsLasso regression was used to find associations between diseases and miRNAs using their gene signature. Defining miRNA gene signature by integrating the downstream effect of miRNAs demonstrated better performance than the miRNA signature alone. Integrating biological networks and multiple data to define miRNA and disease gene signature demonstrated high performance to uncover new functional associations between miRNAs and diseases.",2013,EURASIP Journal on Bioinformatics and Systems Biology
Territorial boundaries of the male beaugregory damselfish,"On six separate occasions during a two month period, there were no significant differences in mean attack distances by territorial male beaugregory damselfish Stregastes leucostictus against male conspecifics, bluehead wrasse Thalassoma bifasciatus and striped parrotfish Scarus iserti. Feeding areas and patrolling areas were typically smaller than attack distances. The presence or absence of eggs, or the quantity of eggs within the male's territory also was not significantly correlated with attack distances.

A Universal Analysis of Large-Scale Regularized Least Squares Solutions,"A problem that has been of recent interest in statistical inference, machine learning and signal processing is that of understanding the asymptotic behavior of regularized least squares solutions under random measurement matrices (or dictionaries). The Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO or least-squares with $\ell_1$ regularization) is perhaps one of the most interesting examples. Precise expressions for the asymptotic performance of LASSO have been obtained for a number of different cases, in particular when the elements of the dictionary matrix are sampled independently from a Gaussian distribution. It has also been empirically observed that the resulting expressions remain valid when the entries of the dictionary matrix are independently sampled from certain non-Gaussian distributions. In this paper, we confirm these observations theoretically when the distribution is sub-Gaussian. We further generalize the previous expressions for a broader family of regularization functions and under milder conditions on the underlying random, possibly non-Gaussian, dictionary matrix. In particular, we establish the universality of the asymptotic statistics (e.g., the average quadratic risk) of LASSO with non-Gaussian dictionaries.",2017,
Structure-Leveraged Methods in Breast Cancer Risk Prediction,"Predicting breast cancer risk has long been a goal of medical research in the pursuit of precision medicine. The goal of this study is to develop novel penalized methods to improve breast cancer risk prediction by leveraging structure information in electronic health records. We conducted a retrospective case-control study, garnering 49 mammography descriptors and 77 high-frequency/low-penetrance single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from an existing personalized medicine data repository. Structured mammography reports and breast imaging features have long been part of a standard electronic health record (EHR), and genetic markers likely will be in the near future. Lasso and its variants are widely used approaches to integrated learning and feature selection, and our methodological contribution is to incorporate the dependence structure among the features into these approaches. More specifically, we propose a new methodology by combining group penalty and [Formula: see text] (1 â‰¤ p â‰¤ 2) fusion penalty to improve breast cancer risk prediction, taking into account structure information in mammography descriptors and SNPs. We demonstrate that our method provides benefits that are both statistically significant and potentially significant to people's lives.",2016,Journal of machine learning research : JMLR

The Diagnostic Value of Radiomics-Based Machine Learning in Predicting the Grade of Meningiomas Using Conventional Magnetic Resonance Imaging: A Preliminary Study,"Objective: The purpose of the current study is to investigate whether texture analysis-based machine learning algorithms could help devise a non-invasive imaging biomarker for accurate classification of meningiomas using machine learning algorithms. Method: The study cohort was established from the hospital database by reviewing the medical records. Patients were selected if they underwent meningioma resection in the neurosurgery department between January 2015 and December 2018. A total number of 40 texture parameters were extracted from pretreatment postcontrast T1-weighted (T1C) images based on six matrixes. Three feature selection methods were adopted, namely, distance correlation, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT). Multiclass classification methods of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms were employed to establish the classification models. The diagnostic performances of models were evaluated with confusion matrix based on which the areas under the curve, accuracy, and Kappa value of models were calculated. Result: Confusion matrix showed that the LDA-based models represented better diagnostic performances than SVM-based models. The highest accuracy among LDA-based models was 75.6%, shown in the combination of Lasso + LDA. The optimal models for SVM-based models was Lasso+SVM, with accuracy of 59.0% in the testing group. One of the SVM-based models, GBDT+SVM, was overfitting, suggesting that this model was not suitable for application. Conclusion: Machine learning algorithms with texture features extracted from T1C images could potentially serve as the assistant imaging biomarkers for presurgically grading meningiomas.",2019,Frontiers in Oncology
Research Reports: Tolerance of Citrus Rootstocks to Preemergence Herbicides 1,"Seven preemergence herbicides, Lasso (alachlor), Surflan (oryzalin), Devrinol (napropamide), Solicam (norflurazon), Goal (oxyfluorfen), Treflan (trifluralin), and Ronstar (oxadiazon) all at 1.1 and 2.2 kg/ha (1.0 and 2.0 lb/A) were evaluated for weed control and phytotoxicity to Carrizo citrange [Citrus sinensis (L.) Osb. x Poncirus trifoliata (L.) Raf.] , Trifoliate orange [Poncirus trifoliata (L.) Raf.] and Swingle citrumelo [Poncirus trifoliata (L.) Raf. x Citrus paradisi Macf.] citrus rootstock seedling. Goal (oxyflurofen) was most effective in controlling weeds, but was also phytotoxic to all 3 rootstocks. Surflan (oryzalin) provided satisfactory weed control (about 70070) without any phytotoxicity to citrus rootstocks but Lasso (alachlor) and Devrinol (napropamide) did not effectively control the weeds. Carrizo citrange was most susceptible to Goal (oxyÂ­ fluorfen), while Swingle citrumelo was more sensitive to Treflan (trifluralin) and Ronstar (oxadiazon). Trifoliate orange was intermediate in tolerance to all herbicides. Some herbicide treatments reduced the plant height but not the trunk diameter of Carrizo citrange and Swingle citrumelo. Trunk diameter of Trifoliate orange was significantly reduced by herbicide treatÂ­ ments, but was unaffected in Carrizo citrange and Swingle citrumelo.",1984,
Accessing marker effects and heritability estimates from genome prediction by Bayesian regularized neural networks,"Abstract Recently, there is an increasing interest on semi- and non-parametric methods for genome-enabled prediction, among which the Bayesian regularized artificial neural networks (BRANN) stand. We aimed to evaluate the predictive performance of BRANN and to exploit SNP effects and heritability estimates using two different approaches (relative importance-RI, and relative contribution-RC). Additionally, we aimed also to compare BRANN with the traditional RR-BLUP and BLASSO by using simulated datasets. The simplest BRANN (net1), RR-BLUP and BLASSO methods outperformed other more parameterized BRANN (net2, net3, â€¦ net6) in terms of predictive ability. For both simulated traits (Y1 and Y2) the net1 provided the best h 2 estimates (0.33 for both, being the true h 2 =0.35), whereas RR-BLUP (0.18 and 0.22 for Y1 and Y2, respectively) and BLASSO (0.20 and 0.26 for Y1 and Y2, respectively) underestimated h 2 . The marker effects estimated from net1 (using RI and RC approaches) and RR-BLUP were similar, but the shrinkage strength was remarkable for BLASSO on both traits. For Y1, the correlation between the true fifty QTL effects and the effects estimated for the SNPs located in the same QTL positions were 0.61, 0.60, 0.60 and 0.55, for RI, RC, RR-BLUP and BLASSO; and for Y2, these correlations were 0.81, 0.81, 0.81 and 0.71, respectively. In summary, we believe that estimates of SNP effects are promising quantitative tools to bring discussions on chromosome regions contributing most effectively to the phenotype expression when using ANN for genomic predictions.",2016,Livestock Science
Reference evapotranspiration prediction using hybridized fuzzy model with firefly algorithm: Regional case study in Burkina Faso,"Reference Evapotranspiration (ETo) is one of the major components of the hydrological cycle that is very essential in water resources planning, irrigation and drainage management and several other hydrology processes. In irrigation system and design, the prediction of ETo is vital and indispensable for the quantification of crop water needs. This study investigates the capabilities of hybridized fuzzy model with firefly algorithm (ANFIS-FA) for predicting daily reference evapotranspiration over Burkina Faso region. Metrological information at Bobo Dioulasso, Bur Dedougou, and Ouahigouya stations, in Sahelian, Sudano-Sahelian, and Sudanian zone, are used for modelling development. Six different climatic input variable combinations corresponding to 6 models are inspected. The daily Penman-Monteith reference evapotranspiration for the time-period (1998â€“2012) are used to train and test the models. Several numerical indicators in addition to Taylor diagram are considered to evaluate the performance of the models. Results indicated that the hybrid ANFIS-FA model outperformed the classical ANFIS-based model for all three stations and the model with full inputs climatic data gave the best results. Furthermore, ANFIS-FA is performed the best for Bur Dedougou (Sahalian-Soudanian region) and less at Ouahigouya (sahalian region). In quantitative terms and for instance Bur Dedougou station, ANFIS-FA model increased the prediction accuracy remarkably (SI = 0.043, R2 = 0.97, MAPE = 0.035 and RMSE = 0.24) compared with ANFIS-based model (SI = 0.068, R2 = 0.89, MAPE = 0.037 and RMSE = 0.378). Results revealed the influence of utilizing nature-inspired firefly algorithm to substantially improve performance of the classical ANFIS model optimization for the applied application. Also, the applied modelling strategy can bring a trustful expert intelligent system for predicting reference evapotranspiration at the west desert of Africa.",2018,Agricultural Water Management
A Comparative Study on Bias Regression Methods in the Presence of Multicollinearity Based on Gamma and Chi Square Distributions,"The aim of this study is to compare some regression methods in the presence of multicollinearity problem. This problem makes the estimated regression coefficients by least squares method to be conditional upon the correlated predictor variables in the model. It is also a condition in a set of regression data that have two or more regressors which are redundant and have the same information. Therefore, some regression methods that handle with multicollinearity such as partial least square regression (PLSR), ridge regression (RR) and lasso regression (LR) had reported. In this paper, the methods were compared using simulated data that follows gamma and chi square distributions with P= 4 and 10, and n =60 and 90. All results were compared with each other through Mean Square Log Error (MSLE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R 2 of their estimated values for different methods. The results show that when P =4 and n=60 RR is better methods with gamma distribution, but with chi square distribution PLRS is better methods. Also, when P= 4 and n=90, RR shows better results with gamma distribution but with chi square distribution all methods have equal predictive ability. However, at P =10 and n=60 RR performed better with both gamma and chi square distributions while RR shows better results at both gamma and chi square distributions when P =10 and n=90.

Machine Learning on Graphs,"Many datasets can be looked at as signals over a graph structure. To this end, the field of graphical models has been a fruitful area of research. This thesis examines a model for time series data called the Sticky Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden Markov Model (SHDPHMM), proposed by Emily Fox. It is useful for clustering time series data where the number of hidden states is unknown, which is often the case in practice. The contribution of this thesis is the derivation of the deterministic variational inference update equations for doing inference on the SHDPHMM. This is an improvement over the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm proposed by Fox as it allows for direct assessment of convergence and can run faster. For a noisy signal over the nodes in a graph, the fused lasso can be used as a denoising method. The fused lasso is a particular case of the generalized lasso, a regularized regression problem which encourages sparsity in a linear transformation of the regression coefficients. This thesis completes the picture of equivalences between the generalized lasso, its dual problem, and the subspace constrained lasso (SCL) and its dual problem. The sparsity is directly expressed in the SCL. The structure of this problem allows for codeword screening. Many of the screening methods both of the single shot and sequential variety are derived in this thesis for the SCL, which depends on the structure of the dual problem. Screening in this case is not as effective as it is for the lasso, where it can reduce very large dictionaries to a fraction of the size. However, it is still an important tool which allows for increased speed of solving the SCL and hence the generalized lasso.",2014,
Optimized application of penalized regression methods to diverse genomic data,"MOTIVATION
Penalized regression methods have been adopted widely for high-dimensional feature selection and prediction in many bioinformatic and biostatistical contexts. While their theoretical properties are well-understood, specific methodology for their optimal application to genomic data has not been determined.


RESULTS
Through simulation of contrasting scenarios of correlated high-dimensional survival data, we compared the LASSO, Ridge and Elastic Net penalties for prediction and variable selection. We found that a 2D tuning of the Elastic Net penalties was necessary to avoid mimicking the performance of LASSO or Ridge regression. Furthermore, we found that in a simulated scenario favoring the LASSO penalty, a univariate pre-filter made the Elastic Net behave more like Ridge regression, which was detrimental to prediction performance. We demonstrate the real-life application of these methods to predicting the survival of cancer patients from microarray data, and to classification of obese and lean individuals from metagenomic data. Based on these results, we provide an optimized set of guidelines for the application of penalized regression for reproducible class comparison and prediction with genomic data.

Clear cell renal cell carcinoma: Machine learning-based computed tomography radiomics analysis for the prediction of WHO/ISUP grade.,"PURPOSE
To evaluate the performance of machine learning (ML)-based computed tomography (CT) radiomics analysis for discriminating between low grade (WHO/ISUP I-II) and high grade (WHO/ISUP III-IV) clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCCs).


METHODS
A total of 164 low grade and 107 high grade ccRCCs were retrospectively analyzed in this study. Radiomic features were extracted from corticomedullary phase (CMP) and nephrographic phase (NP) CT images. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated to quantify the feature's reproducibility. The training and validation cohort consisted of 163 and 108 cases. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression method was used for feature selection. The machine learning (ML) classifiers were k-NearestNeighbor (KNN), Logistic Regression (LR), multilayer perceptron (MLP), Random Forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM). The performance of classifiers was mainly evaluated and compared by certain metrics.


RESULTS
Seven CMP features (ICC range, 0.990-0.999) and seven NP features (ICC range, 0.931-0.999) were selected. The accuracy of CMP, NP and the combination of CMP and NP ranged from 82.2%-85.9 %, 82.8%-94.5 % and 86.5%-90.8 % in the training cohort, and 90.7%-95.4%, 77.8%-79.6 % and 91.7%-93.5 % in the validation cohort. The AUC of CMP, NP and the combination of CMP and NP ranged from 0.901 to 0.938, 0.912 to 0.976, 0.948 to 0.968 in the training cohort, and 0.957 to 0.974, 0.856 to 0.875, 0.960 to 0.978 in the validation cohort.


CONCLUSIONS
ML-based CT radiomics analysis can be used to predict the WHO/ISUP grade of ccRCCs preoperatively.",2019,European journal of radiology
Network-Constrained Group Lasso for High-Dimensional Multinomial Classification with Application to Cancer Subtype Prediction,"Classic multinomial logit model, commonly used in multiclass regression problem, is restricted to few predictors and does not take into account the relationship among variables. It has limited use for genomic data, where the number of genomic features far exceeds the sample size. Genomic features such as gene expressions are usually related by an underlying biological network. Efficient use of the network information is important to improve classification performance as well as the biological interpretability. We proposed a multinomial logit model that is capable of addressing both the high dimensionality of predictors and the underlying network information. Group lasso was used to induce model sparsity, and a network-constraint was imposed to induce the smoothness of the coefficients with respect to the underlying network structure. To deal with the non-smoothness of the objective function in optimization, we developed a proximal gradient algorithm for efficient computation. The proposed model was compared to models with no prior structure information in both simulations and a problem of cancer subtype prediction with real TCGA (the cancer genome atlas) gene expression data.

The proposed strategy was based on the resolution of a LASSO problem constructed from the navigation equations using the reweighted $-\ell _{1}$ method. This strategy requires to adjust the regularization parameters balancing the data fidelity term and the involved regularizations. This paper introduces a new Bayesian estimation method allowing the MP biases and the unknown model parameters and hyperparameters to be estimated directly from the GNSS measurements. The proposed method is based on Bernoulli-Laplacian priors, promoting sparsity of MP biases.",2018,2018 IEEE Statistical Signal Processing Workshop (SSP)
Ein Test der Modelle III und IV hinsichtlich ihrer Eignung als Verlaufsmodelle fÃ¼r Zwecke einer Projektion,"Es wurde bereits im theoretischen Teil dieser Analyse darauf hingewiesen, das jedes okonometrische Dezisionsmodell auch als Verlaufsmodell interpretiert werden kann. Daraus ergibt sich die Moglichkeit, ein Modell im Hinblick auf seine Prognosefahigkeit zu testen und damit ein Urteil uber die dem Modell zugrundegelegten Annahmen und die Zuverlassigkeit seiner Koeffizienten zu gewinnen. Wenn auch der Zweck eines okonometrischen Modells, welches fur eine bestimmte Zeitperiode verifiziert wird, nicht allein darin bestehen kann, zuverlassoge Prognosen zu stellen, so kann doch umgekehrt aus einer solchen Prognose auf die Verwendbarkeit des Modells als Dezisionsmodell fur weitere Perioden geschlossen werden. Fur quantitative Prognosen dieser Art hat sich in der Okonomie der Begriff Projektion eingeburgert, der auch in dieser Untersuchung verwendet werden soll. Die Eignung fur Projektionszwecke kann als einer der scharfsten Tests fur ein okonometrisches Modell angesehen werden.",1961,
Predicting mortality over different time horizons: which data elements are needed?,"Objective: Electronic health records (EHRs) are a resource for â€œbig dataâ€ analytics, containing a variety of data elements. We investigate how different categories of information contribute to prediction of mortality over different time horizons among patients undergoing hemodialysis treatment. Material and Methods: We derived prediction models for mortality over 7 time horizons using EHR data on older patients from a national chain of dialysis clinics linked with administrative data using LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) regression. We assessed how different categories of information relate to risk assessment and compared discrete models to time-to-event models. Results: The best predictors used all the available data (c-statistic ranged from 0.72â€“0.76), with stronger models in the near term. While different variable groups showed different utility, exclusion of any particular group did not lead to a meaningfully different risk assessment. Discrete time models performed better than time-to-event models. Conclusions: Different variable groups were predictive over different time horizons, with vital signs most predictive for near-term mortality and demographic and comorbidities more important in long-term mortality.",2017,Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association
Sparse Spikes Super-resolution on Thin Grids II: the Continuous Basis Pursuit,"This article analyzes the performance of the Continuous Basis Pursuit (C-BP) method for sparse super-resolution. The C-BP has been recently proposed by Ekanadham, Tranchina and Simoncelli as a refined discretization scheme for the recovery of spikes in inverse problems regularization. One of the most well known discretization scheme, the Basis Pursuit (BP, also known as Lasso) makes use of a finite dimensional l1 norm on a grid. In contrast, the C-BP uses a linear interpolation of the spikes positions to enable the recovery of spikes between grid points. When the sought-after solution is constrained to be positive, a remarkable feature of this approach is that it retains the convexity of the initial l1 problem. The present paper shows how the C-BP is able to recover the spikes locations with sub-grid accuracy in the favorable case. We also prove that this regime generally breaks when the grid is too thin, and we describe precisely the artifacts that appear: each spike is approximated by a pair of Dirac masses. We show numerical illustrations of these phenomena, and evaluate numerically the validity of the technical assumptions of our analysis.",2017,Inverse Problems
Nearly optimal Bayesian Shrinkage for High Dimensional Regression,"During the past decade, shrinkage priors have received much attention in Bayesian analysis of high-dimensional data. In this paper, we study the problem for high-dimensional linear regression models. We show that if the shrinkage prior has a heavy and flat tail, and allocates a sufficiently large probability mass in a very small neighborhood of zero, then its posterior properties are as good as those of the spike-and-slab prior. While enjoying its efficiency in Bayesian computation, the shrinkage prior can lead to a nearly optimal contraction rate and selection consistency as the spike-and-slab prior. Our numerical results show that under posterior consistency, Bayesian methods can yield much better results in variable selection than the regularization methods, such as Lasso and SCAD. We also establish a Bernstein von-Mises type results comparable to Castillo et al (2015), this result leads to a convenient way to quantify uncertainties of the regression coefficient estimates, which has been beyond the ability of regularization methods.",2017,arXiv: Statistics Theory
The benthic invertebrates of the Salton Sea: distribution and seasonal dynamics,"The Salton Sea, California's largest inland water body, is an athalassic saline lake with an invertebrate fauna dominated by marine species. The distribution and seasonal dynamics of the benthic macroinvertebrate populations of the Salton Sea were investigated during 1999 in the first survey of the benthos since 1956. Invertebrates were sampled from sediments at depths of 2â€“12 m, shallow water rocky substrates, and littoral barnacle shell substrates. The macroinvertebrates of the Salton Sea consist of a few invasive, euryhaline species, several of which thrive on different substrates. The principal infaunal organisms are the polychaetes Neanthes succinea Frey & Leuckart and Streblospio benedicti Webster, and the oligochaetes Thalassodrilides gurwitschi Cook, T. belli Hrabe, and an enchytraeid. All but Neanthes are new records for the Sea. Benthic crustacean species are the amphipods Gammarus mucronatus Say, Corophium louisianum Shoemaker, and the barnacle Balanus amphitrite Darwin. Neanthes succinea is the dominant infaunal species on the Sea bottom at depths of 2â€“12 m. Area-weighted estimates of N. succinea standing stock in September and November 1999 were two orders of magnitude lower than biomass estimated in the same months in 1956. During 1999, population density varied spatially and temporally. Abundance declined greatly in offshore sediments at depths >2 m during spring and summer due to decreasing oxygen levels at the sediment surface, eventually resulting in the absence of Neanthes from all offshore sites >2 m between July and November. In contrast, on shoreline rocky substrate, Neanthes persisted year round, and biomass density increased nearly one order of magnitude between January and November. The rocky shoreline had the highest numbers of invertebrates per unit area, exceeding those reported by other published sources for Neanthes, Gammarus mucronatus, Corophium louisianum, and Balanus amphitrite in marine coastal habitats. The rocky shoreline habitat is highly productive, and is an important refuge during periods of seasonal anoxia for Neanthes and for the other invertebrates that also serve as prey for fish and birds.",2004,Hydrobiologia
The Network Structure of Childhood Psychopathology in International Adoptees,"International adoptees are at an increased risk of emotional and behavioral problems, especially those who are adopted at an older age. We took a new approach in our study of the network structure and predictability of emotional and behavioral problems in internationally adopted children in Finland. Our sample was from the on-going adoption study and comprised 778 internationally adopted children (387 boys and 391 girls, mean age 10.5 (SD 3.4) years). Networks were estimated using Gaussian graphical models and lasso regularization for all the children, and separately for those who were adopted at different ages. The results showed that anxiety/depressive symptoms, social problems, and aggressiveness were the most central symptom domains. Somatic symptoms were the least central and had the weakest effect on the other domains. Similarly, aggressiveness, social problems, and attention problems were high in terms of predictability (73â€“65%), whereas internalizing problems were relatively low (28â€“56%). There were clear but local age-group differences in network structure, symptom centrality, and predictability. According to our findings, network models provide important additional information about the centrality and predictability of specific symptom domains, and thus may facilitate targeted interventions among international adoptees.",2018,Journal of Child and Family Studies
Variable Selection With the Strong Heredity Constraint and Its Oracle Property,"In this paper, we extend the LASSO method (Tibshirani 1996) for simultaneously fitting a regression model and identifying important interaction terms. Unlike most of the existing variable selection methods, our method automatically enforces the heredity constraint, that is, an interaction term can be included in the model only if the corresponding main terms are also included in the model. Furthermore, we extend our method to generalized linear models, and show that it performs as well as if the true model were given in advance, that is, the oracle property as in Fan and Li (2001) and Fan and Peng (2004). The proof of the oracle property is given in online supplemental materials. Numerical results on both simulation data and real data indicate that our method tends to remove irrelevant variables more effectively and provide better prediction performance than previous work (Yuan, Joseph, and Lin 2007 and Zhao, Rocha, and Yu 2009 as well as the classical LASSO method).",2010,Journal of the American Statistical Association
"Tuberculosis in the Sierra Santa Marta, Veracruz: An Analysis from a Gender Perspective","Analysis of women's health has historically been associated with women's reproductive roles (Gender and Health Group, 1999). Thus, it is necessary to differentiate between analysis of women's health and gender analysis of health, which ""focuses attention on the dialectics of relations between biology and the social milieu, which translates into situations of disadvantage or advantage of women vis-a-vis men . . . inequality understood in terms of the probabilities to enjoy health, fall ill or die"" (Gomez, 1993, p. xi). A gender analysis of health needs to establish the relation between biological factors and the definitions and values that culture allocates to both women and men. This approach will help us to highlight what seems so obvious because of its pervasive occurrence: the ways in which gender influences roles, needs, risks, responsibilities, and access to resources (Gomez, 1993). Understanding gender differences in the health-disease process and gender relations within the household and at the community level is necessary to fully grasp the determinants and consequences of disease in women and men. For example, certain diseases are not adequately diagnosed because gender stereotypes lead physicians to establish a differentiated diagnosis, depending on whether the patient is a man or a woman, thus underestimating the actual morbidity or mortality rate of certain diseases. Myocardial infarction is an example of this. It has been demonstrated that the diagnosis is established sooner in men than in women, because the same symptoms are evaluated differently (McKinlay, 1996). In the Third World, the influence of gender issues in morbidity and mortality of women and men has been often concealed with factors such as lack of economic resources and inaccessibility to health services, among others. Some scholars contend that these factors affect women and men alike. However, others have argued that women face specific constraints in the health system in terms of the access and quality of the provided services (Cassel quoted in McKinlay, 1996). Several studies have shown that although women and men may share a number of problems resulting from geographic location, living conditions, and ethnicity, gender inequality places women in a vulnerable situation regarding their health (Okojie, 1994; Vlassof, 1994). Hudelson (1996) suggests that the response to disease is different in women and men, and that the barriers for early detection and treatment vary for both genders. The intention in this essay is precisely to explore how the interplay between economic and gender factors shapes women's and men's perceptions of disease, search for attention, and likelihood of success in treatment. Research was conducted among all individuals diagnosed with ganglionary and pulmonary tuberculosis between January 1, 1998, and December 31, 1999, by Mexican health institutions responsible for servicing the municipalities of Pajapan, Tatahuicapan, Mecayapan, and Soteapan, located in the Sierra de Santa Marta of southeastern Veracruz. Information was gathered in two phases. In the first phase, secondary sources (health archives, government censuses) were reviewed, health officers and practitioners were interviewed, and a survey was applied in the homes of the 40 individuals (21 women and 19 men) diagnosed with tuberculosis. The survey was conducted using a structured and precoded questionnaire in order to obtain information on the sociodemographic characteristics of individuals, as well as information about their disease. In the second phase, in-depth interviews were conducted with 13 informants, who were selected according to the criteria of age, sex, ethnic group, and treatment status. These interviews were designed to delve into the perception of symptoms and attributed causes, the process of searching for health attention, and the possibility to successfully complete treatment. Pseudonyms are used throughout the essay in order to maintain the anonymity of informants. â€¦",2003,Womenâ€™s Studies Quarterly

A New Family of Error Distributions for Bayesian Quantile Regression,"We propose a new family of error distributions for model-based quantile regression, which is constructed through a structured mixture of normal distributions. The construction enables fixing specific percentiles of the distribution while, at the same time, allowing for varying mode, skewness and tail behavior. It thus overcomes the severe limitation of the asymmetric Laplace distribution -- the most commonly used error model for parametric quantile regression -- for which the skewness of the error density is fully specified when a particular percentile is fixed. We develop a Bayesian formulation for the proposed quantile regression model, including conditional lasso regularized quantile regression based on a hierarchical Laplace prior for the regression coefficients, and a Tobit quantile regression model. Posterior inference is implemented via Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. The flexibility of the new model relative to the asymmetric Laplace distribution is studied through relevant model properties, and through a simulation experiment to compare the two error distributions in regularized quantile regression. Moreover, model performance in linear quantile regression, regularized quantile regression, and Tobit quantile regression is illustrated with data examples that have been previously considered in the literature.",2017,arXiv: Methodology

Assessing Alcohol-Associated Risks Based on Alcohol Consumption,"One indirect measure of alcoholassociated risks is per capita alcohol consumption. This approach is based on the observation that a person's likelihood of experiencing negative consequences of drinking increases with the amount of alcohol consumed. Researchers are therefore closely monitoring trends in alcohol consumption. Recent Trends in Alcohol Consumption Following Prohibition, per capita alcohol consumption in the United States generally increased, reaching its peak in 1980 and 1981. Since then, alcohol consumption primarily has been declining. In 1993, the latest year for which complete data are available, per capita consumption of all alcoholic beverages combined reached its lowest level since 1964 (Williams et al. 1995). For the consumption of any kind of beverage, beer ranked fourth (behind soft drinks, coffee, and milk) in per capita consumption, a position it has held for many years. Beer also accounted for 57 percent of the absolute alcohol each person consumed; wine represented 13 percent; and spirits made up the remaining 30 percent, the lowest level for the consumption of spirits in 50 years (Williams et al. 1995). To estimate total and per capita alcohol consumption, researchers rely on data such as alcoholic beverage sales, production, and tax revenues. Based on these data, the total apparent alcohol consumption for the United States in 1993 included approximately 5.8 billion gallons of beer, 454 million gallons of wine, and 341 million gallons of spirits (Williams et al. 1995). These amounts translate into 303 12-ounce cans of beer, 58 5-ounce glasses of wine, and 142 mixed drinks containing 1.5 ounces of distilled spirits for every man and woman age 14 and older in the country (Williams et al. 1995). Although per capita alcohol consumption is a robust and useful measure of alcohol-consumption trends, it is only a relatively crude indicator of alcohol-related risk, because it assumes that every person in the population of interest drinks and that all people consume equal amounts of alcohol. In general, however, drinking patterns vary significantly among the members of a population. Drinking Patterns and Associated Outcomes Slightly more than one-half of American men and one-third of American women age 18 and older were current drinkers in 1992 (Dawson et al. 1995). Moreover, despite the fact that the legal drinking age is 21, alcohol use is common among young people. Approximately 56 percent of 8th graders, 71 percent of 10th graders, and 80 percent of 12th graders report having used alcohol at some time in their lives (Johnston et al. 1995). (For more information on the drinking patterns of adolescents and young adults, see the articles by Chassin and DeLucia, pp. 175-180, and Quigley and Marlatt, pp. 185-191.) When evaluating individual risk based on these data, one must remember that actual alcohol consumption is unevenly distributed (see table) and that the 10 percent of drinkers who drink most heavily account for 50 percent of all alcohol consumed (Malin et al. â€¦",1996,Alcohol health and research world
Electrocorticographic dynamics predict visually guided motor imagery of grasp shaping,"Identification of intended movement type and movement phase of hand grasp shaping are critical features for the control of volitional neuroprosthetics. We demonstrate that neural dynamics during visually-guided imagined grasp shaping can encode intended movement. We apply Procrustes analysis and LASSO regression to achieve 72% accuracy (chance = 25%) in distinguishing between visually-guided imagined grasp trajectories. Further, we can predict the stage of grasp shaping in the form of elapsed time from start of trial (R2=0.4). Our approach contributes to more accurate single-trial decoding of higher-level movement goals and the phase of grasping movements in individuals not trained with brain-computer interfaces. We also find that the overall time-varying trajectory structure of imagined movements tend to be consistent within individuals, and that transient trajectory deviations within trials return to the task-dependent trajectory mean. These overall findings may contribute to the further understanding of the cortical dynamics of human motor imagery.",2017,2017 8th International IEEE/EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering (NER)

Identification and Validation of a Potent Multi-miRNA Signature for Prediction of Prognosis of Osteosarcoma Patients,"BACKGROUND Osteosarcoma, the most common solid malignancy, has high incidence and mortality rates. We constructed a miRNA-based signature that can be used to assess the prognosis of osteosarcoma patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS The miRNA profile was derived from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) website, with matched clinical records. The miRNA-based overall survival (OS)-predicting signature was established by LASSO Cox regression analysis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and Kaplan-Meier (K-M) analyses were performed to examine the stability and discriminatory ability of the OS-predicting signatures. Pathway enrichment analyses were performed to uncover potential mechanisms. RESULTS Three miRNAs (miR-153, miR-212, and miR-591) independently related to the OS were extracted to build a risk score formula. The ROC curve and K-M analyses revealed good discrimination ability of the OS signature for osteosarcoma patients in both the training cohort (P=0.00015, AUC=0.962) and the validation cohort (P=0.0065, AUC=0.793). As shown in multivariate analysis, the classifier showed favorable predictive accuracy similar to the recurrence status to be an independent risk factor for osteosarcoma. Furthermore, the nomogram showed a synergistic effect by combining the clinicopathological features with our classifier. Also, the enrichment analyses of the target genes may contribute to improved treatment of osteosarcoma. CONCLUSIONS The 3-miRNA-based classifier serves as an effective prognosis-predicting signature for osteosarcoma patients.",2020,Medical Science Monitor : International Medical Journal of Experimental and Clinical Research

We also found a Mangalocypria population on Ishigaki Island that was morphologically identical to M. ryukyuensis on Okinawa, but an individual differed by 4.7% in COI sequence (K2P distance) from an individual from Okinawa. This is the first record for Japan of a species in Mangalocypria. Paracypria longiseta sp. nov., obtained from Okinawa Island, is similar to Pontoparta hartmanni. Paracypria plumosa sp. nov. from Ishigaki Island is similar to Pa. adnata described from Yakushima Island, Japan. The COI genetic distance between individuals of Pa. longiseta and Pa. plumosa was roughly as large as that between either of these species and individuals in the Mangalocypria populations.

A Comparative Study on Machine Learning Approaches to Thunderstorm Gale Identification,"In this paper, we make a comparative study to examine the performance of different machine learning approaches for the thunderstorm gale identification. To this end, a thunderstorm gale benchmark dataset is constructed, which comprises radar images in Guangdong from 2015 to 2017. The corresponding wind velocities recorded by the automatic meteorological observation stations are utilized to offer the ground-truth. Based on the dataset, we evaluate the performance of Decision Tree Regressor (DT), Linear Regression (LR), Ridge regression, Lasso regression, Random Forest Regressor (RFR), K-nearest Neighbor Regressor (KNNR), Bayesian Ridge Regressor (BR), Adaboost Regressor (AR), Support Vector Regressor (SVR), Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Ten important features are extracted to apply these approaches, except CNN, which include radar echo intensity, radar reflectivity factor, radar combined reflectivity, vertical integrated liquid, echo tops and their changes with respect to (w.r.t.) time. Experimental results demonstrate the machine learning approaches can effectively identify the thunderstorm gale, and the CNN model performs the best. Finally, a thunderstorm system is developed based on CNN model, which help meteorologists to identify thunderstorm gales in terms of radar images.",2019,

Application of Machine Learning Models for Survival Prognosis in Breast Cancer Studies,"The application of machine learning models for prediction and prognosis of disease development has become an irrevocable part of cancer studies aimed at improving the subsequent therapy and management of patients. The application of machine learning models for accurate prediction of survival time in breast cancer on the basis of clinical data is the main objective of the presented study. The paper discusses an approach to the problem in which the main factor used to predict survival time is the originally developed tumor-integrated clinical feature, which combines tumor stage, tumor size, and age at diagnosis. Two datasets from corresponding breast cancer studies are united by applying a data integration approach based on horizontal and vertical integration by using proper document-oriented and graph databases which show good performance and no data losses. Aside from data normalization and classification, the applied machine learning methods provide promising results in terms of accuracy of survival time prediction. The analysis of our experiments shows an advantage of the linear Support Vector Regression, Lasso regression, Kernel Ridge regression, K-neighborhood regression, and Decision Tree regressionâ€”these models achieve most accurate survival prognosis results. The cross-validation for accuracy demonstrates best performance of the same models on the studied breast cancer data. As a support for the proposed approach, a Python-based workflow has been developed and the plans for its further improvement are finally discussed in the paper.",2019,Information
Variable selection in high-dimensional linear model with possibly asymmetric or heavy-tailed errors.,"We consider the problem of automatic variable selection in a linear model with asymmetric or heavy-tailed errors when the number of explanatory variables diverges with the sample size. For this high-dimensional model, the penalized least square method is not appropriate and the quantile framework makes the inference more difficult because to the non differentiability of the loss function. We propose and study an estimation method by penalizing the expectile process with an adaptive LASSO penalty. Two cases are considered: the number of model parameters is smaller and afterwards larger than the sample size, the two cases being distinct by the adaptive penalties considered. For each case we give the rate convergence and establish the oracle properties of the adaptive LASSO expectile estimator. The proposed estimators are evaluated through Monte Carlo simulations and compared with the adaptive LASSO quantile estimator. We applied also our estimation method to real data in genetics when the number of parameters is greater than the sample size.",2018,arXiv: Statistics Theory

Alternative Model of Personality Disorders (DSM-5) Predicts Dropout in Inpatient Psychotherapy for Patients With Personality Disorder,"Objective
Criterion A serves as the fundamental diagnostic criterion of the Alternative Model of Personality Disorders in section III of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 5. Consisting of a self- and an interpersonal dimension, it defines the construct of personality functioning as a general and dimensional factor of personality disorders. This study aimed to explore criterion A along with well-established treatment dropout predictors, e.g., sociodemographic factors, personality disorder diagnosis, symptom severity, and the therapeutic alliance.


Methods
The sample consisted of 132 patients diagnosed with personality disorder in a psychotherapeutic inpatient treatment. Cox proportional hazard regression models and a lasso model were applied.


Results
28% of the sample prematurely discontinued treatment. The risk for dropout was 2.3 times higher for patients with high impairments in self-functioning as assessed with criterion A. Moreover, a positive therapist-rated therapeutic alliance was associated with a lower dropout risk.


Conclusion
The study suggests criterion A is a useful clinical indicator by identifying patients with personality disorder with a higher risk for dropout. An individualized therapeutic approach for such patients might be required.",2019,Frontiers in Psychology
Comparing Time-Varying Price Impact and Information Impounding Time Across Asian Stock Exchanges: An Adaptive Lasso Approach,"In this paper we construct a parsimonious vector autoregression model with durations, trades and quote revisions to compare price impact and information impounding time in four Asian stock exchanges. We conduct simultaneous model selection and estimation using the adaptive lasso approach. We measure the price impact and the information impounding time via examining the impulse response of a new trade. Weekly estimation from January 2007 to August 2012 allows us to compare the time-varying price impacts. We find that the price impact and the information impounding time vary considerably across time. Traders in Korean and Japanese markets pay more attention to high price impact trades while traders in Hong Kong and Chinese markets pay less attention. Larger mean price impact has larger impact uncertainty measured by the price impactâ€™s standard deviation. Longer mean information impounding time has higher convergence uncertainty measured by the information impounding timeâ€™s standard deviation. For many stocks, price impacts have spikes during the 2008 financial crisis. The price impact is negatively related to liquidity and positively related to systematic risk. The average correlation among price impacts of different stocks also varies across time. In Korean and Chinese markets, when systematic risk is high, the average correlation among price impacts is also high.",2012,
Lasso Methods for Gaussian Instrumental Variables Models,"In this note, we propose to use sparse methods (e.g. LASSO, Post-LASSO, sqrt-LASSO, and Post-sqrt-LASSO) to form first-stage predictions and estimate optimal instruments in linear instrumental variables (IV) models with many instruments in the canonical Gaussian case. The methods apply even when the number of instruments is much larger than the sample size. We derive asymptotic distributions for the resulting IV estimators and provide conditions under which these sparsity-based IV estimators are asymptotically oracle-efficient. In simulation experiments, a sparsity-based IV estimator with a data-driven penalty performs well compared to recently advocated many-instrument-robust procedures. We illustrate the procedure in an empirical example using the Angrist and Krueger (1991) schooling data.",2011,arXiv: Methodology
Symptoms of mood disorders in family carers of older people with dementia who experience caregiver burden: a network approach.,"BACKGROUND
informal carers of people with dementia are at greater risk of anxiety and depressive disorders if they find caregiving to be a burden. The aim of this study was to use a network analysis of cross-sectional data to investigate the relationships between anxiety and depressive symptoms in family carers of older people with dementia who experience burden.


METHODS
sixty family carers exhibiting high levels of burden using the Zarit Burden Interview were included in the study. Participants completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. The network analysis identified the depression and anxiety symptom network using features including a topological graph, network centrality metrics and community analysis. The network was estimated through the graphical LASSO technique in combination with a walktrap algorithm to obtain the clusters within the network and the connections between the nodes (symptoms). A directed acyclic graph was generated to model symptom interactions.


RESULTS
the resulting network architecture shows important bridges between depression and anxiety symptoms. Lack of pleasure and loss of enjoyment were identified as potential gateway symptoms to other anxiety and depression symptoms and represent possible therapeutic targets for psychosocial interventions. Fear and loss of optimism were highly central symptoms, indicating their importance as warning signs of more generalised anxiety and depression.


CONCLUSIONS
this network analysis of depressive and anxiety symptoms in overburdened family carers provides important insights as to what symptoms may be the most important targets for behavioural interventions.",2020,Age and ageing
Flexible Bayesian Quantile Regression with Lasso Penalty ( FBLQR ),"The selection of predictors plays a crucial role in building a multiple regression model. Indeed, the choice of a suitable subset of predictors can help to improve prediction accuracy and interpretation. In this paper, we propose a flexible Bayesian Lasso and adaptive Lasso quantile regression by introducing a hierarchical model framework approach to enable exact inference and shrinkage of an unimportant coefficient to zero. The error distribution is assumed to be an infinite mixture of Gaussian densities. We have theoretically investigated and numerically compared our proposed methods with Flexible Bayesian quantile regression (FBQR), Lasso quantile regression (LQR) and quantile regression (QR) methods. Simulations and real data studies are conducted under different settings to assess the performance of the proposed methods. The proposed methods perform well in comparison to the other methods in terms of median mean squared error, mean and variance of the absolute correlation criterions. We believe that the proposed methods are useful practically.",2013,
Abstract 16955: Training EP Fellows to Use Low Fluoroscopy Techniques for Atrial Fibrillation Ablation,"Introduction: Despite the use of 3D electroanatomic mapping (EAM) systems, atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation still requires high radiation exposure and fluoroscopy (FL) times. Using CARTO UnivU (CU), FL images are imported to create a background over which virtual catheters are displayed and then fused with EAM of the left atrium, thus simulating FL without further radiation. We report techniques to train EP fellows in low FL left atrial ablation (LA) using CU, phased-array intracardiac ultrasound (ICE) and force-sensing (FS) catheters. Methods: We performed 52 ablations for AF and left atrial flutter (LAF) from Feb to Nov 2015 in which the EP fellow was primary operator. AP and LAO CU images were obtained and ICE was advanced from the left femoral vein to the right atrium, to image the SVC. The guidewire and transseptal long sheath were positioned in the SVC under ICE guidance. We then performed pullback to the fossa under ICE guidance until tenting of the fossa was observed. Transseptal puncture was performed using ICE and FL in the LAO projection. A second transseptal sheath was placed using the same technique. EAM of the left atrium was performed using a multipolar mapping catheter (Pentarray or LassoNav). A coronary sinus catheter was advanced without FL, using both CU and ICE. Following transseptal puncture, all catheter manipulation was done with CU, ICE and the force vector of the FS catheter. At this point, lead protective wear was no longer needed. Results: We performed 52 ablations: 47 for AF (30 persistent) and 5 for LAF. The mean age was 66 yrs., 64% were male, and 12% had implanted devices. Mean procedure time was 225 (120 - 390) min with 40 (14 - 68) min of RF ablation. Mean FL time was 4.2 (0.5 - 8.4) min and mean dose of 22 (9-124) cGy. Pulmonary vein isolation was performed in all patients. Additional LA ablation was performed in 16 patients; 4 had CTI ablation. There was 1 major complication of cardiac tamponade requiring pericardiocentesis. Conclusions: CU is an intuitive mapping system that together with FS catheters and ICE imaging facilitates catheter manipulation during LA ablation, allowing very low fluoroscopy exposure, even during training of EP fellows.",2016,Circulation

Climatotherapy of psoriasis.,"In the era when biological treatments for psoriasis are gaining more and more popularity, climatotherapy represents a safe and efficient alternative to the conventional therapeutic modalities. Climatotherapy comprises alternative treatment methods, which are based on the healing capacities of natural resources. This paper provides the reader with relevant information on the different climatotherapeutic methods, the intimate mechanisms of their action, and the cumulated clinical experience in the treatment of psoriasis. The positive effect of thalassotherapy for psoriasis has been known since ancient times. However, in the past decades a number of controlled studies revealed the efficacy of thalassotherpay in the treatment of psoriasis. Herein, it is exemplified on the experience in the centers at the Dead Sea and the Black Sea coast. Originating from Europe, balneo- and spa therapy are becoming popular alternatives for psoriasis treatment worldwide. A short review on the centers profiled for psoriasis therapy is provided. The unique sites of Blue Lagoon in Iceland and Kangal in Turkey are selected in this paper. Additionally, alternative nature-based treatments for psoriasis such as high mountain climatotherapy and naphtalotherapy are discussed.",2008,Clinics in dermatology
A new conifer from the Upper Triassic of southern Poland linking the advanced voltzialean type of ovuliferous scale with Brachyphyllum-Pagiophyllum-like leaves,"Abstract The Triassic is an exceptionally interesting period from the point of view of conifer evolution. The oldest representatives of some modern families appear in the fossil record in the Upper Triassic and all recent conifer families probably originated during this time. The stages whereby the primitive Voltziales transformed into the evolutionarily advanced families of modern conifers in the Triassic are yet to be fully documented. A newly discovered Upper Triassic (Norian) locality in Patoka (SW Poland, Upper Silesia) with a unique fossil record offers us a rare opportunity to fill this gap. In this paper, we describe the very well preserved remains of a new conifer from this locality. We have been able to reconstruct the whole plant and propose a new taxon, Patokaea silesiaca gen. et sp. nov., on the basis of organic attachment and similar cuticular details on leaves, ovuliferous cones, seed scale-bract complexes, ovules and mature seeds as well as polliniferous cones containing pollen grains of the Enzonalasporites type in situ. This plant combines shoots bearing Brachyphyllum - Pagiophyllum -type leaves with a new type of seed scale-bract complex clearly derived from evolutionary advanced Voltziales and polliniferous cones somewhat similar to the Cheirolepidiaceae ( Classostrobus ) type. Based on this distinctive and hitherto unique combination of features, a new conifer family â€“ Patokaeaceae â€“ has been proposed. The ovuliferous cones of this conifer are lax and borne singly at the end of leafy twigs. Ovule-bearing scales are stalked and trilobate with two lateral oval lobes, each bearing one ovule, and one sterile reduced lobe between them, all in one plane. The bract is small and leaf-like. Polliniferous cones are simple with helically arranged microsporophylls. Five to seven pollen sacs are arranged around the microsporophyll stalk. Polliniferous cones are borne singly at the end of leafy twigs. This is also the first evidence of a relationship between Enzonalasporites pollen and the parent plant. The pollen occurs in the polliniferous cones, in the micropyle inside the ovule and in the micropylar region inside the seed of this new conifer. This plant expands our view of voltzialean conifer diversity at the roots of modern conifer families.",2017,Review of Palaeobotany and Palynology
Some Worked-Out Examples,"The sharp oracle inequalities for the Lasso, the square-root Lasso and other structured sparsity estimators are completed with a probability statement saying the result holds with confidence at least 1 âˆ’Î± (say), with Î± > 0 a fixed error level. Also a sharp oracle inequality for projection estimators of a density are given. As a â€œrepresentativeâ€ example for the case of non-linear M-estimation with an l1-penalty, a sharp oracle inequality is presented for logistic regression. For trace regression with nuclear norm penalty, a sharp oracle is given when least squares loss is used, and a non-sharp one when least absolute deviations loss is used. In the latter case, the design is taken as in the matrix completion problem. As final example sparse principal component analysis is addressed.",2016,
"Energy conserving, linear scaling Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics.","Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics simulations with long-term conservation of the total energy and a computational cost that scales linearly with system size have been obtained simultaneously. Linear scaling with a low pre-factor is achieved using density matrix purification with sparse matrix algebra and a numerical threshold on matrix elements. The extended Lagrangian Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics formalism [A. M. N. Niklasson, Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 123004 (2008)] yields microcanonical trajectories with the approximate forces obtained from the linear scaling method that exhibit no systematic drift over hundreds of picoseconds and which are indistinguishable from trajectories computed using exact forces.",2012,The Journal of chemical physics
