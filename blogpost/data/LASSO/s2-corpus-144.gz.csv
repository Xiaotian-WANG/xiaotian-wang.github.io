"[Susceptibility of Culex quinquefasciatus to insecticides in Bobo Dioulasso, Burkina Faso].","This study conducted from 1999 to 2000 in the suburbs of Bobo Dioulasso a town in the South of Burkina, aimed at investigating the susceptibility of the local population of Culex quinquefasciatus to various insecticides and proposing alternative strategies allowing a better management of insecticide resistance in the field. Eggs of C. quinquefasciatus were first collected in stagnant waste water places. The larvae were reared to early 4rth instar and tested by larval bioassays to determine the LC50/95 and the resistance ratios (RR50 and RR95) as well as their confidence intervals. A susceptible reference Strain ""Slab"" was used as control. Resistance was found to DDT and pyrethroids, but reduced susceptibility was found for carbamates, organophosphorates, phenyl pyrazole and in a less extend to Bacillus sphaericus. Resistance to pyrethroides is quite alarming since these insecticides are mainly used for bed net impregnation for the Roll Back malaria programme implemented in Africa. The high levels of insecticide resistance in C. quinquefasciatus suggest that alternative strategies have to be implemented to minimize the pressure of selection on resistant genes. The use of bio-larvicides (Bacillus sphaericus) alone or in rotation with different compounds may be a promising strategy for controlling C. quinquefasciatus in Bobo Dioulasso.",2005,Bulletin de la Societe de pathologie exotique
Group sparse topical coding: from code to topic,"Learning low dimensional representations of text corpora is critical in many content analysis and data mining applications. It is even more desired and challenging to learn a sparse representation in practice for large scale text modeling. However, traditional probabilistic topic models (PTM) lack a mechanism to directly control the posterior sparsity of the inferred representations; While the emerged non-probabilistic models (NPM) can explicitly control sparsity using sparse constraint like l_1 norm, they convey different limitations in latent representations. To address the existing problems, we propose a novel non-probabilistic topic model for discovering sparse latent representations of large text corpora, referred as group sparse topical coding (GSTC). Our model enjoys both the merits of the PTMs and NPMs. On one hand, GSTC can naturally derive document-level admixture proportions in topic simplex like PTMs, which is useful for semantic analysis, classification or retrieval. On the other hand, GSTC can directly control the sparsity of the inferred representations with group lasso by relaxing the normalization constraint. Moreover, the relaxed non-probabilistic GSTC can be effectively learned using coordinate descent method. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that GSTC can discover meaningful compact latent representations of documents, and improve the document classification accuracy and time efficiency.",2013,
Six-long non-coding RNA signature predicts recurrence-free survival in hepatocellular carcinoma,"BACKGROUND
Recent evidence shows that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are closely related to hepatogenesis and a few aggressive features of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Increasing studies demonstrate that lncRNAs are potential prognostic factors for HCC. Moreover, several studies reported the combination of lncRNAs for predicting the overall survival (OS) of HCC, but the results varied. Thus, more effort including more accurate statistical approaches is needed for exploring the prognostic value of lncRNAs in HCC.


AIM
To develop a robust lncRNA signature associated with HCC recurrence to improve prognosis prediction of HCC.


METHODS
Univariate COX regression analysis was performed to screen the lncRNAs significantly associated with recurrence-free survival (RFS) of HCC in GSE76427 for the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) modelling. The established lncRNA signature was validated and developed in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) series using Kaplan-Meier curves. The expression values of the identified lncRNAs were compared between the tumor and non-tumor tissues. Pathway enrichment of these lncRNAs was conducted based on the significantly co-expressed genes. A prognostic nomogram combining the lncRNA signature and clinical characteristics was constructed.


RESULTS
The lncRNA signature consisted of six lncRNAs: MSC-AS1, POLR2J4, EIF3J-AS1, SERHL, RMST, and PVT1. This risk model was significantly associated with the RFS of HCC in the TCGA cohort with a hazard ratio (HR) being 1.807 (95%CI [confidence interval]: 1.329-2.457) and log-rank P-value being less than 0.001. The best candidates of the six-lncRNA signature were younger male patients with HBV infection in relatively early tumor-stage and better physical condition but with higher preoperative alpha-fetoprotein. All the lncRNAs were significantly upregulated in tumor samples compared to non-tumor samples (P < 0.05). The most significantly enriched pathways of the lncRNAs were TGF-Î² signaling pathway, cellular apoptosis-associated pathways, etc. The nomogram showed great utility of the lncRNA signature in HCC recurrence risk stratification.


CONCLUSION
We have constructed a six-lncRNA signature for prognosis prediction of HCC. This risk model provides new clinical evidence for the accurate diagnosis and targeted treatment of HCC.",2019,World Journal of Gastroenterology

Reconstruction of Complex Time-varying Weighted Networks Based on LASSO,"Network reconstruction is significant in a variety of domains including physics, biology, engineering and social science. Although a lot of effort has been put into static network reconstructions, time-varying networks are rarely studied. Existing studies of time-varying networks usually assume nodes' dynamics to be linear or consider nodes' nonlinear dynamics as prior knowledge. In this paper, identification of time-varying weighted networks is discussed under the condition where network topology, link weights and nodes' nonlinear dynamics are all unknown or unavailable. In fact, networks in real world are naturally sparse which enables the transformation from network reconstruction problem into sparse signal recovering, so that $l_{1}$ regularization can be effectively applicable. Based on the assumption that most natural networks can be mathematically expressed by only a few important analytical functions, we construct a function set consisting of both linear and nonlinear candidate functions. Then LASSO is applied to select the possible function assemblies from the proposed set and optimize the coefficients of the corresponding function terms in order to best describe time-varying structures as well as nodes' nonlinear dynamics. To prove the feasibility and effectiveness of this reconstruction method, both two complex models are testified in networks of different sizes. And this method shows potential ability applying to a wide range of dynamical time-varying networks.",2018,2018 37th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)
Alternative life-histories in protogynous fishes: a general evolutionary theory,"Populations of many 'protogynous' fishes actually consist of 2 life-history pathways. Along one path, an individual is a male for its entire life; along the other, an individual is a female first, a male second. This paper develops a general evolutionary theory predicting the stable proportions of each type in a population that is the Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS). Protogyny, sex reversal from female to male, is widely distributed in fish (review in Warner, 1978; Charnov, 1982). It is particularly common in parrotfish and wrasses (families Scaridae and Labridae). The lifehistory of these often includes 2 color phases, a duller i n i t i a l p h a s e followed by a brighter t e r m i n a l p h a S e , although some species are monochromatic. Many species (Robertson and Choat, 1974; Robertson and Warner, 1978; Warner and Robertson, 1978; Warner and Hoffman, 1980) also show 2 alternative life-history pathways coexisting in a single breeding population. A schematic representation of this is shown in Fig. 1, with special reference to wrasses of the genus Thalassorna. Individuals may enter initial phase as either males or females. For example, the figure shows Pproportion of a cohort entering the male pathway. At some time later in life, not necessarily the same along each pathway, a n individual enters terminal phase. Such individuals are males, and in contrast to initial phase fish, often have very different color, reproductive anatomy, and behavior patterns. Thus individuals who were female in initial phase reverse their sex to enter terminal phase (in addition to the evolutionary theory. The 2 pathways are thought to coexist because of frequency dependent natural selection. A wide variety of autosomal population genetic models predict that the proportion of individuals going down each pathway will be adjusted (in equilibrium or at ESS) such that the reproductive gains per individual are equalized for the 2 pathways (e.g. Gross and Charnov, 1980). This paper proposes a general ESS model, which theoretically links P to some other life history characteristics. For the 2 pathways shown in Fig. 1 (with reference to Thalassoma spp.) , Warner and Hoffman (1980) showed the ESS P to follow a particularly simple form. Their derivation assumed: (1) mortality, growth and change to terminal phase was the same on average for all initial phase individuals; (2) females mated once each day, and there was no tendency for larger or smaller females to mate with terminal as opposed to initial phase males; (3) the life history during terminal phase was on average equivalent for the 2 pathways; (4) that the population was stationary (unchanging in size with INITIAL PHASE I TERMINAL PHASE other changes). However, the initial phase males simI Fig. 1. Thalassoma spp. Alternative life-history pathways in anatomy and behavior' since they are wrasse of the aenus Thalassoma.

Ser 9: 305-307, 1982 a stable age distribution). Their result was very simple; in ESS, P was related to 2 population parameters. Define: T ' = average number of females who mate each day with each terminal phase male. S' = proportion of the population in terminal phase. The Warner-Hoffman result was that For the 2 species of the genus Thalassoma they studied, T ' . S ' < .l, so that Equation (1) is almost equivalent to P 1/2 (1 T' . S') (2) The testing of this relation (Eq. 2) for these 2 species is in Warner and Hoffman (1980) and Charnov (1982). Charnov (1982) showed that Equation 1 is equivalent to h p = P l + h (or = l P h) where h = proportion of the entire female population who mate with the initial phase males. This relation also relaxed the assumption that females mated once each day indeed, in many laborid species females probably mate less often than once each day. Warner (pers. comm., cited in Charnov, 1982) had noted, however, that some locations with Thalassoma had initial phase male, b U t that these males did not breed. Charnov (1982) suggested that this type of initial phase male could nonetheless be in ESS, provided that the initial phase non-breeding male more than doubled its chances of reaching terminal phase. That is, the nonbreeding individual might survive better and/or grow faster, contrasted to an initial phase female. According to Charnov (1982), if such a nonbreeder male has a chance a of reaching terminal phase, compared to a chance of 1 for an initial phase female (i.e. . . he is a times more likely to reach terminal phase), a stationary population has an ESS P where Now, Equation (3) assumes the 2 life-history pathways to be equivalent in growth and mortality while allowing the initial phase males access to h proportion of the females. Eq. (4) allows the 2 pathways to differ in growth and mortality, but assumes that no females are available to mate with initial phase males. Clearly, the 2 key variables are h and a, and what we would like to do is to combine them into one ESS theory. I have done this for one general situation and report here the answer This ESS P was derived by introducing into a stationary population a mutant gene whose bearer alters its own P, a , or the proportion of the h females it mates with. We then look for population values for P and a such that the mutant is always selected against. Since this method of analysis is detailed in Charnov (1982), I will not present the algebra here, but will simply discuss the final result. If h and a are assumed to take fixed values (or to be a function of each other) or if a rare mutant who alters its a to 6 (e.g. expends more energy in reproduction) does not really alter the population wide h (the mutant (6) initial phase male may well garner for itself a greater fraction of the females who are available to a l l the initial phase males, but overall h of the females go to the little males), then the ESS P/(1 -P) is the positive root of the following quadratic equation. Let A = P/(1-P); the equation is If a = 1, A = h; if h = 0, A = 1 2/a (these are Equations 3 and 4). In Fig. 2, I have graphed P/(1 -P) versus h for 4 a values. Somewhat surprisingly, for a between .5 and 1.5 (which seem like large deviations in the male compared to the female pathway), the rule P/ (1 -P) h is still very close to that theoretically predicted. Proportion of females mated to initial phase males (=h) Fig 2. The ESS P/(1P) as a function of h , the proportion of the females who mate wlth initial phase males, and a, the relative chances of an initial phase male (compared to a female) making ~t to terminal phase. For a between .5 and 1.5. the relation P/(1 -P) h is a good approximation Charnov (1982) discussed several data sets for labroid fishes (work of Warner, Robertson, Hoffman, Choat as cited above), and concluded that P was related to h as predicted (Eq. 3), at least qualitatively. While there are no published data on a, such field data may be possible . . in which case we can test the more general theory as given in Equation (5). Acknowledgement. J.

Targeted Covariate-Adjusted Response-Adaptive LASSO-Based Randomized Controlled Trials,"We present a new covariate-adjusted response-adaptive randomized controlled trial design and inferential procedure built on top of it. The procedure is targeted in the sense that {\em (i)} the sequence of randomization schemes is group-sequentially determined by targeting a user-specified optimal randomization design based on accruing data and, {\em (ii)} our estimator of the user-specified parameter of interest, seen as the value of a functional evaluated at the true, unknown distribution of the data, is targeted toward it by following the paradigm of targeted minimum loss estimation. We focus for clarity on the case that the parameter of interest is the marginal effect of a binary treatment and that the targeted optimal design is the Neyman allocation, in an effort to produce an estimator with smaller asymptotic variance. For clarity too, we consider the case that the estimator of the conditional outcome given treatment and baseline covariates, a key element of the procedure, is obtained by LASSO regression. Under mild assumptions, the resulting sequence of randomization schemes converges to a limiting design, and the TMLE estimator is consistent and asymptotically Gaussian. Its asymptotic variance can be estimated too. Thus we can build valid confidence intervals of given asymptotic levels. A simulation study confirms our theoretical results.",2014,
"Leveraging latent structure in high-dimensional data: causality, neuroscience, and nonparametrics","Author(s): Bloniarz, Adam | Advisor(s): Yu, Bin | Abstract: Many scientific fields have been changed by rapid technological progress in data collection, storage, and processing. This has greatly expanded the role of statistics in scientific research. The three chapters of this thesis examine core challenges faced by statisticians engaged in scientific collaborations, where the complexity of the data require use of high-dimensional or nonparametric methods, and statistical methods need to leverage lower dimensional structure that exists in the data. The first chapter concerns the promise and challenge of using large datasets to uncover causal mechanisms. Randomized trials remain the gold-standard for inferring causal effects of treatment a century after their introduction by Fisher and Neyman. In this chapter, we examine whether large numbers of auxilary covariates in a randomized experiment can be leveraged to help improve estimates of the treatment effect and increase power. In particular, we investigate Lasso-based adjustments of treatment effects through theory, simulation, and a case study of a randomized trial of the pulmonary artery cathether. In our investigation, we avoid imposing a linear model, and examine the robustness of Lasso to violations of traditional assumptions.The second chapter examines the use of predictive models to elucidate functional properties of the mammalian visual cortex. We investigate the activity of single neurons in area MT when stimulated with natural video. One way to investigate single-neuron activity is to build encoding models that predict spike rate given an arbitrary natural stimulus. In this work, we develop encoding models that combine a nonlinear feature extraction step with a linear model. The feature extraction step is unsupervised, and is based on the principle of sparse coding. We compare this model to one that applies relatively simple, fixed nonlinearities to the outputs of V1-like spatiotemporal filters. We find evidence that some MT cells may be tuned to more complex video features than previously thought.The third chapter examines a computational challenge inherent in nonparametric modeling of large datasets. Large datasets are often stored across many machines in a computer cluster, where communication between machines is slow. Hence, nonparametric regression methods should avoid communication of data as much as possible. Random forests, among the most popular nonparametric methods for regression, are not well-suited to distributed architectures. We develop a modification of random forests that leverage ideas in nonparametric regression by local modeling. Our method allows for training of random forests completely in parallel, without synchronization between machines, with communication of sufficient statistics at test-time only. We show that this method can improve the predictive performance of standard random forests even in the single-machine case, and that performance remains strong when data is distributed.",2016,

Compositional data network analysis via lasso penalized D-trace loss,"MOTIVATION
With the development of high-throughput sequencing techniques for 16S-rRNA gene profiling, the analysis of microbial communities is becoming more and more attractive and reliable. Inferring the direct interaction network among microbial communities helps in the identification of mechanisms underlying community structure. However, the analysis of compositional data remains challenging by the relative information conveyed by such data, as well as its high dimensionality.


RESULTS
In this article, we first propose a novel loss function for compositional data called CD-trace based on D-trace loss. A sparse matrix estimator for the direct interaction network is defined as the minimizer of lasso penalized CD-trace loss under positive-definite constraint. An efficient alternating direction algorithm is developed for numerical computation. Simulation results show that CD-trace compares favorably to gCoda and that it is better than sparse inverse covariance estimation for ecological association inference (SPIEC-EASI) (hereinafter S-E) in network recovery with compositional data. Finally, we test CD-trace and compare it to the other methods noted above using mouse skin microbiome data.


AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION
The CD-trace is open source and freely available from https://github.com/coamo2/CD-trace under GNU LGPL v3.

A convex optimization framework for the identification of homogeneous reaction systems,"Abstract A new convex optimization framework for the simultaneous identification of reaction stoichiometries and kinetics for homogeneous reaction systems is developed. The identification problem is posed as a non-negative Lasso program that incorporates both a set of hypothesized reaction stoichiometries and a set of hypothesized reaction rate laws. Estimation error bounds are established and an iterative technique for finding a proper value of the Lasso tuning parameter for model selection and parameter identification is also developed. The technique was tested via simulation on a continuous stirred tank reactor process demonstrating recovery of stoichiometry, reaction rate laws and near recovery of model parameters using noisy reactor species concentration measurements. This was demonstrated even for a case that was previously described to be structurally unidentifiable. The same was also demonstrated for the case when a subset of reactor species concentration measurements is only available.",2020,Autom.
"Productivity, family planning and reproductive health in Burkina Faso: the PopDev study","Quantitative data from a prospective cohort study of 839 pregnant and/or postpartum women who were between seven months gestation and three months postpartum at recruitment. Participants were interviewed three times over a nine month period. The cohort is a population-representative sample of parturient women in the commune of Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso. Data were collected relating to socio-demographic characteristics; household assets; reproductive history; womenâ€™s work and occupation including both income-generating and non-income generating activities; birth and postpartum preparedness; characteristics of the index delivery; contraceptive history and current use; fertility preferences; health-related functioning (ability to carry out usual daily activities); haemoglobin level; mental health measured through the K10 scale; time use diary; household food security scale.",2015,
Morfologia corporal de equinos Quarto de Milha puros e mestiÃ§os utilizados no LaÃ§o Comprido no Mato Grosso do Sul,"The paper examined the coats and morphometric and conformation indices of 125 adult Quarter horses, distributed in purebred horses (67 females and 26 males) and crossbred horses (24 females and 8 males), used in Lasso competitions in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. Coat color variation was studied based on simple count of the occurrences of the phenomenon. The morphometric analysis considered 28 linear measurements, which were the base for the calculation of 12 conformation indices. The least squares method was applied. The variation sources in the model were the effects of gender, genetic group (purebred or crossbred horses), and the interaction genetic group/gender. The Pearson correlation was estimated between the morphometric and the conformation indices. The most predominant coat colors among the horses were bay (42.40â€‰%) and chestnut (22.40â€‰%). The variation sources affected the morphometric and conformation indices (p<0.05). The study suggests morphometric indices correlated with conformation indices that may contribute to the production of equines with the desired skills.",2015,Archivos De Zootecnia
Hypothalamic and extrahypothalamic sauvagine-like immunoreactivity in the bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) central nervous system.,"In the present study, immunocytochemistry and radioimmunoassay were used to investigate the presence of sauvagine in both hypothalamic and extrahypothalamic areas of the central nervous system (CNS) of the bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) using a specific antiserum raised against synthetic non-conjugated sauvagine (SVG), a frog (Phyllomedusa sauvagei) skin peptide of the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) family. Sauvagine-immunoreactive (SVG-ir) bipolar neurons were found in the nucleus of the fasciculus longitudinalis medialis located in the rostral mesencephalic tegmentum. In the tectal mesencephalon, beaded SVG-ir fibres were present in the optic tectum, and in the torus semicircularis. Abundant SVG-ir varicose fibres were seen in the granulosa layer of the cerebellum, the nucleus isthmi, and the obex of the spinal cord. SVG-ir fibres were also seen by the alar plate of the rombencephalon. In the diencephalon, the antiserum stained parvocellular neurons of the preoptic nucleus (PON) which extended their dendrites into the cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) of the third ventricle and projected their ependymofugal fibres to the zona externa (ZE) of the median eminence. Immunopositive fibres were also present in the medial forebrain bundle at the chiasmatic field, the posterior thalamus, the pretectal gray, and the ventrocaudal hypothalamus. In the telencephalon (forebrain), SVG-ir fibres were seen in the medial septum, the lateral septum, and the amygdala. The SVG immunoreactivity could not be detected after using the SVG antiserum previously immunoabsorbed with synthetic SVG (0.1 microM), but immunoblock of the antiserum with sucker (Catostomus commersoni) urotensin I (sUI), sole (Hippoglossoides elassodon) urotensin I, sucker CRF, rat/human CRF, or ovine CRF (0.1-10 microM) did not eliminate visualization of the immunoreactivity. In radioimmunoassay, the SVG antiserum did not crossreact with sUI, or the SVG fragments SVG1-16, SVG16-27, and SVG26-34, but it recognized the C-terminal fragment SVG35-40. Crossreaction with mammalian ovine CRF and rat/human CRF was negligible. Both hypothalamic and mesencephalic extracts gave parallel displacement curves to SVG. The results suggest the presence in the bullfrog brain of a SVG-like neuropeptide, i.e., a peptide of the CRF family, that either is SVG or shares high homology with the C-terminus of that peptide. The function of this neuropeptide in amphibians is not known at this time, but based on its anatomical distribution to the ZE it could affect the release of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) or other substances from the amphibian pars distalis. Involvement of the SVG-like peptide in behavioural (forebrain), visual (thalamus-tegmentum mesencephali-pretectal gray-optic tectum), motor coordination (cerebellum), and autonomic (spinal) functions, as well as an undefined interaction with the CSF in the bullfrog, seems likely.",1996,The Journal of comparative neurology
Pattern and process in the biogeography of subterranean amphipods,"The comparative data from studies of two â€˜superfamilyâ€™ groups with large numbers of subterranean taxa, the exclusively freshwater Crangonyctoidea and the predominately marine Hadzioidea, support the hypothesis that distributional patterns and evolutionary processes of stygobiont amphipods are closely linked and that the former can be a useful indicator of the latter. Three major biogeographic patterns are indicated by the distribution of subterranean species in these groups, each apparently reflecting a particular mode of origin: (1) freshwater stygobionts (limnostygobionts) derived from epigean freshwater ancestors through colonizations probably influenced by adaptive shifts, or assisted by stream capture and spring failure; (2) freshwater stygobionts derived from marine/brackish water ancestors by stranding during regression of marine embayments; and (3) marine/brackish water stygobionts (thalassostygobionts) derived from epigean marine/brackish water ancestors through adaptive shifts possibly in concert with fluctuating sea levels.ZusammenfassungVergleichende Untersuchungen zweier Superfamilien, jede mit einer grossen Anzahl unterirdischer Taxa, die ausschiesslich im SÃ¼sswasser verbreiteten Crangonyctoidea und die vorwiegend marinen Hadzioidea, stÃ¼tzen die Hypothese, dass Verbreitungsmuster und phylogenetische Prozesse stygobionter Amphipoden eng miteinander verbunden sind, und dass Erstere ein nÃ¼tzlicher Indikator fÃ¼r Letztere sind. Die Verbreitung unterirdischer Arten in dieser Gruppe weist auf drei biogeographische Muster hin, von denen jedes eine bestimmte Herkunft reflecktiert: (1) SÃ¼sswasser-Stygobionten (Limnostygobionten) kÃ¶nnen durch Kolonisation, wahrscheinlich beeinflusst durch VerÃ¤nderungen in der Anpassung, aus epigÃ¤ischen SÃ¼sswasser-Vorfahren hergeleitet werden, oder unterstÃ¼tzt durch â€˜stream captureâ€™ and â€˜spring failureâ€™ (Versiegen von Quellen); (2) SÃ¼sswasser-Stygobionten stammen von marinen/Brackwasser-Vorfahren ab, welche im Verlauf der marinen Regression â€˜gestrandetâ€™ sind: und (3) marine/Brackwasser-Stygobionten (Thalassostygobionten) enstammen epigÃ¤ischen marinen/Brackwasser-Vorfahren durch VerÃ¤nderungen in der Anpassung in Zusammenhang mit WasserstandsÃ¤nderungen.",2004,Hydrobiologia

"The TERT promoter mutation status and MGMT promoter methylation status, combined with dichotomized MRIâ€derived and clinical features, predict adult primary glioblastoma survival","PURPOSE
This study aimed to integrate the TERT promoter mutation status, MGMT promoter methylation status, MRI-derived features, and clinical features into a survival analysis model to better understand adult primary glioblastoma prognosis-related markers.


METHOD
A total of 304 adult glioblastoma samples collected after surgical resection were selected for retrospective analysis, and Sanger sequencing was performed to detect IDH and TERT promoter mutations. The methylation of the MGMT promoter was analyzed by pyrosequencing, and MRI-derived and clinical features were dichotomized into easily acquired variables. Random survival forest analysis, Kaplan-Meier analysis, Cox proportional hazard regression, and LASSO regression were performed for the survival analysis, and ROC analysis and Pearson's chi-squared test were employed for the correlation analysis.


RESULTS
Wild-type IDH was present in 89.8% of the adult glioblastoma samples, and TERT promoter mutations and MGMT promoter methylation were observed in 66.42% and 38.49% of all adult primary glioblastomas, respectively. Age and MGMT promoter methylation were identified as independent prognostic biomarkers, and the TERT promoter mutation status and MGMT promoter methylation status, when combined with other tumor-related factors, generated several different survival subgroups. None of the factors investigated in this study predicted the MGMT promoter status, and MRI-detected necrosis was positively associated with TERT promoter mutations.


CONCLUSION
MGMT promoter methylation and TERT promoter mutations, combined with MRI-derived and clinical features, revealed different survival subgroups with distinct responses to current treatments, and this information increases the ability to predict the survival of adult primary glioblastoma patients. MRI-detected necrosis often indicates the presence of TERT promoter mutations.",2018,Cancer Medicine
Expanding the Map of Intrinsic and Extrinsic Aspirations Using Network Analysis and Multidimensional Scaling: Examining Four New Aspirations,"Life goals or aspirations can be distinguished as intrinsic or extrinsic, with different implications for well-being. In this study we used network analysis to reexamine this intrinsic-extrinsic distinction, illustrating how novel candidate aspirations can be mapped along this dimension using innovative methods. We identify four previously unexamined life aspirations, predicting that aspiring for power and social adherence would group with extrinsic goals, whereas aspiring for self-expression and mastery would group with intrinsic goals. In two samples (n = 196; n = 346) we analyze both the original life-goal variables and these novel aspirations using factor analysis, multidimensional scaling, circumplex modeling, and a network analysis using a graphical least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (glasso) to estimate the network structure of aspirations using EBIC. Replicating past intrinsic-extrinsic distinctions, all four methods further classified power and social adherence as extrinsic goals, and self-expression and mastery as intrinsic goals. The intrinsic-extrinsic distinction was also clearly visible in the network analysis. Finally, consistent with hypotheses, power and social adherence were unrelated to wellness indicators, whereas self-expression and mastery correlated positively with well-being indicators and negatively with ill-being indicators, supporting their hypothesized nature as extrinsic and intrinsic, respectively.",2019,Frontiers in Psychology
22 The Family Rhodospirillaceae,"Rhodospirillaceae Pfennig and TrÃ¼per 1971, 17 Rhodospirillaceae are a family within the order Rhodospirillales in the subclass ofAlphaproteobacteria. The family Rhodospirillaceae, the so-called purple non-sulfur bacteria, have the type genus Rhodospirillum and embrace a total of 34 genera: Azospirillum, Caenispirillum, Constrictibacter, Defluviicoccus, Desertibacter, Dongia, Elstera, Ferrovibrio, Fodinicurvata, Inquilinus, Insolitispirillum, Limimonas, Magnetospira, Magnetospirillum, Magnetovibrio, Marispirillum, Nisaea, Novispirillum, Oceanibaculum, Pelagibius, Phaeospirillum, Phaeovibrio, Rhodocista, Rhodospira, Rhodospirillum, Pararhodospirillum, Rhodovibrio, Roseospira, Skermanella, Telmatospirillum, Thalassobaculum, Thalassospira, Tistlia, and Tistrella. According to 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities, the genera within the Rhodospirillaceae can be grouped into three big clusters: Azospirillumâ€“Skermanellaâ€“ Desertibacterâ€“Rhodocistaâ€“Dongiaâ€“Elsteraâ€“Inquilinus, Magnetospirillumâ€“Nisaeaâ€“Thalassobaculumâ€“Oceanibaculumâ€“Fodinicurvata â€“Pelagibius â€“Tistliaâ€“Phaeospirillumâ€“Telmatospirillumâ€“Defluviicoccusâ€“Tistrellaâ€“Constrictibacterâ€“Rhodovibrioâ€“Limimonas, and Rhodospirillumâ€“Pararhodospirillumâ€“Roseospiraâ€“Rhodospiraâ€“ Phaeovibrioâ€“Novispirillumâ€“Marispirillumâ€“Insolitispirillumâ€“ Caenispirillumâ€“Thalassospiraâ€“Magnetospiraâ€“Magnetovibrioâ€“ Ferrovibrio. Some genera in the family Rhodospirillaceae grow photoheterotrophically under anoxic conditions in the light and chemoheterotrophically in the dark, while others grow heterotrophically under aerobic/microaerobic conditions. The members of the Rhodospirillaceae stain Gram negative and form rod shaped to spirillum-formed cells. The chemoheterotrophs include the facultative anaerobic genera Skermanella, Telmatospirillum, Caenispirillum, Thalassobaculum, and Nisaea and the strictly aerobic and microoxic genera Azospirillum, Conglomeromonas, Magnetospirillum, Thalassospira, Tistrella, and Inquilinus. The genus Azospirillum contains several diazotrophic, plant-associated bacteria having plant growthpromoting potential with agricultural application. Other genera include strains with interesting biotechnological potentials. Some genera also harbor opportunistic pathogenic bacteria, whose risk potential is not yet clear.

Phylogenetically, the family of Rhodospirillaceae is a member of the order Rhodospirillales, subclass Alphaproteobacteria in the phylum Proteobacteria (Stackebrandt et al. 1988). According to the 16S rRNA gene sequence comparison of the type species, the next related family within the the order Rhodospirillales is the family Acetobacteraceae (Gillis and De Ley 1980). The family Rhodospirillaceae contain the genera Azospirillum, Caenispirillum, Constrictibacter, Defluviicoccus, Desertibacter, Dongia, Elstera, Ferrovibrio, Fodinicurvata, Inquilinus, Insolitispirillum, Limimonas, Magnetospira, Magnetospirillum, Magnetovibrio, Marispirillum, Nisaea, Novispirillum, Oceanibaculum, Pelagibius, Phaeospirillum, Phaeovibrio, Rhodocista, Rhodospira, Rhodospirillum, Rhodovibrio, Roseospira, Skermanella, Telmatospirillum, Thalassobaculum, Thalassospira, Tistlia, and Tistrella. Some genera of the family Rhodospirillaceae grow photoheterotrophically under anoxic conditions in the light and chemotrophically in the dark (Pfennig and TrÃ¼per 1971a), while others grow chemoheterotrophically under aerobic conditions. They stain Gram negative and form rod shaped to spirillum-formed cells. Members of Rhodospirillaceae have varying metabolic and nutritional properties, which include photoheterotrophs, photoautotrophs, and chemoheterotrophs. The major respiratory lipochinones are ubiquinones 9, 10, and 11 and/or menaquinone 10 (MK-10). Unsaturated straight chain fatty acids are the predominant acyl groups of the family; among these are summed feature 8 (C18:1o7c and/or C18:1 o6c), summed feature 3 (C16:1 o7c and/or C168:1o6c), and summed feature 2 (consisting of C14:0 3 OH and or iso-C16:0 3-OH). The polar lipids consist mainly of phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, and other lipids which differ from species to species level. The type genus of the family is Rhodospirillum. Azospirillumâ€“Skermanellaâ€“Desertibacterâ€“ Rhodocistaâ€“Dongiaâ€“Elsteraâ€“Inquilinus The genus Azospirillum (Tarand et al. 1979) forms a subcluster within the family Rhodospirillaceae together with the genera Skermanella, Rhodocista, Desertibacter, Dongia, Elstera, and Inquilinus (> Fig. 22.1). These bacteria belong to the large group of â€˜â€˜hydrobacteria,â€™â€™ a clade of prokaryotes that originated in marine environments (Battistuzzi and Hedges 2009). Nearly all known representatives of the family Rhodospirillaceae are found in aquatic habitats, suggesting that Azospirillum represents a lineage which might have transitioned to terrestrial environments much later than the Precambrian split of â€˜â€˜hydrobacteriaâ€™â€™ and â€˜â€˜terrabacteriaâ€™â€™ (Wisniewski-DyÃ© et al. 2011). Azospirillum spp. are members of the a-subclass of Proteobacteria, and this genus was initially described by Krieg and DÃ¶bereiner (1984) to include a species previously named as Spirillum lipoferum (Beijerinck 1925). The growth of a spirillum-like bacterium in nitrogen-deficient malateor lactate-based media, which had been inoculated heavily with garden soil, was first observed by Beijerinck in 1925. When this new bacterium was cultivated in malate medium, the nitrogen content increased, which led to the original species name Azotobacter spirillum. Three years later, it was renamed into Spirillum genus. In 1978 a group of isolates was utilized in a detailed taxonomic study by Tarrand et al. (1978). Based on the DNA homology group II bacteria Azospirillum lipoferum genus and species were described. This group of isolates seemed to correspond in several ways to Beijerinckâ€™s original description of Spirillum lipoferum, particularly with regard to growth with glucose or mannitol and to the formation of spirillum-shaped cells under certain conditions (Krieg and DÃ¶bereiner 1984). These bacteria are spiral or slightly curved rod-shaped nonspore-forming cells with polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) granules, which can form cysts. The Gram staining is negative and the cells are very motile with a single polar flagellum and several lateral flagella, shorter in length. Cells are polymorphic and positive for oxidase as well as catalase reaction (Tarrand et al. 1978). Azospirillum has a large amount of C18:1 o7c lipids (55Â·3 %) and contains also 16:1o7c, 16:0 as a major component; the major hydroxy fatty acids are 3-OH C14:0 and 3-OH C16:0. When grown aerobically, species of this genus exhibit a quinone system with ubiquinone 10 (Q-10). The polar lipids consist mainly of phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, and one unidentified phospholipid. The DNA G+C content varies between 64 and 71 mol%. The occurrence of Azospirillum spp. is widespread in the environment and has significant agricultural importance specifically as aerobic nitrogen-fixing species with considerable plant growth-promoting abilities. A. brasilense and A. lipoferum are known to associate with, and stimulate the growth of, numerous grasses and cereals. Most of the species were described from plant roots and soil samples. These organisms have a plant root tissue origin, especially in soils of tropical and subtropical regions, but also in temperate regions (Lavrinenko et al. 2010). Azospirillum lipoferum and A. brasilense are the two species which were described at first. Later, MagalhÃ£es et al. (1983) described the third species, A. amazonense. Four years later, another species was described, A. halopraeferens (Reinhold et al. 1987) from Kallar grass (Leptochloa fusca) in Pakistan. In 1989, Khammas isolated the 5th species of this genus, A. irakense, using root samples of rice. The taxonomy of the species Conglomeromonas largimobilis subsp. largomobilis hodobium was questioned as its similarity of the species A. lipoferum. The strains of this species were renamed to a new Azospirillum species calledA. largomobilis and then corrected toA. largimobile (Sly and Stackebrandt 1999). In 2001, a new species was described and received the name of the famous scientist Johanna DÃ¶bereiner, calling A. doebereinerae (Eckert et al. 2001). In 2005, another species was described in China, also from rice samples, A. oryzae (Xie and Yokota 2005). Again a new species was described using plant tissue collected in China, A. melinis (Peng et al. 2006), using roots and stem of a plant calledMelinis Azospirillum lipoferum, (Z29619), type sp.

Estimation of VO2 max based on 20 m shuttle run test using statistical learning methods: An example of male physical education students,"This study shows selected statistical learning models for prediction VO2max based on 20 m shuttle run and selected somatic parameters. The research were conducted on 80 male physical education students (age: 21.4Â±1.6). Predictive models were determined from 65 patterns and tested using 15 patterns. The 9 variables were used to build the models, including one dependent variable and 8 independent variables. The prediction methods used were as follows: ordinary least square regression, Ridge regression, Lasso regression, multilayer perceptron and network with radial basis functions. The research show that the model with the least error of prediction is the network with radial basis functions generating the RMSECV = 4.04 error. The best method for new data generate an error on the level of 3.04 compared to the real values.",2018,"2018 2nd International Conference on Technology and Innovation in Sports, Health and Wellbeing (TISHW)"
Network reconstruction with local partial correlation: a comparative evaluation,"Over the past decade, various methods have been proposed for the reconstruction of networks modeled as Gaussian Graphical Models. In this work we analyzed three different approaches: the Graphical Lasso (GLasso), Graphical Ridge (GGMridge) and Local Partial Correlation (LPC). For the evaluation of the methods, we used high dimensional data generated from simulated random graphs (Erd\""os-R\'enyi, Barab\'asi-Albert, Watts-Strogatz). The performance was assessed through the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. In addition the methods were used for reconstruction of co-expression network, for differentially expressed genes in human cervical cancer data. LPC method outperformed the GLasso in most of the simulation cases, even though GGMridge produced better ROC curves then both other methods. LPC obtained similar outcomes as GGMridge in real data studies.",2018,arXiv: Applications
"The US Rebalance in Southeast Asia: Maritime Security, Nontraditional Security Threats, and â€œBamboo Diplomacyâ€","Even if â€œSoutheast Asiaâ€ (SEA) is a recent concept, rooted in World War II,1 and even if heterogeneous toponyms have been used in the past to encompass parts or the entire regionâ€”such as Indochina, Insulindia, and Australasia2â€”this area has consistently been considered throughout history as a critical maritime lock between the East and the West. Because of the seasonal monsoons, indianized thalassocracies like the Funan and Sriwijaya as well as trade sultanates like Malacca and Demak took advantage of this strategic crossroads to successively manage the coasts and to shelter Indian, Chinese, Arab, and Western merchants. Today, Southeast Asia continues to be a critical node for travelers and traders, formal and informal flows, civilian and military people: the airports ofJakarta, Singapore, Bangkok, and Kuala Lumpur are respectively the eighth, tenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth biggest airports in the world in terms of passenger traffic3; Singapore is both the fourth biggest financial hub and the second port for containers in the world; in terms of oil flows, in 2011, 15.2 million barrels per day crossed the Malacca Straits while only 3.8 passed through Bab el Mandeb, in the Gulf of Aden.4 The region is made up of archipelagic states (Indonesia: 17,000 islands; Philippines: 7,000 islands) and many of its straits can be used by both merchant vessels and warships.",2015,
RNN Architecture Learning with Sparse Regularization,"Neural models for NLP typically use large numbers of parameters to reach state-of-the-art performance, which can lead to excessive memory usage and increased runtime. We present a structure learning method for learning sparse, parameter-efficient NLP models. Our method applies group lasso to rational RNNs (Peng et al., 2018), a family of models that is closely connected to weighted finite-state automata (WFSAs). We take advantage of rational RNNs' natural grouping of the weights, so the group lasso penalty directly removes WFSA states, substantially reducing the number of parameters in the model. Our experiments on a number of sentiment analysis datasets, using both GloVe and BERT embeddings, show that our approach learns neural structures which have fewer parameters without sacrificing performance relative to parameter-rich baselines. Our method also highlights the interpretable properties of rational RNNs. We show that sparsifying such models makes them easier to visualize, and we present models that rely exclusively on as few as three WFSAs after pruning more than 90% of the weights. We publicly release our code.",2019,
On the Estimation with Factor Analysis in High Dimensional Settings,"When the number of variables is larger than the sample size, the sample covariance matrix is no longer positive definite, and its inverse does not exists. Under the sparsity assumption, the problem can be dealt with by methods such as the lasso or penalized likelihood. However, in high-dimensional settings in behavioral sciences, the sparsity assumption does not necessarily hold. The number of variables is often greater than the sample size while they might still be comparable. Under such circumstances, unweighted least squares (ULS) and ridge approaches may be good options in estimating the parameters in factor analysis. We examine and compare different approaches, and show that some approach gives relatively small mean square errors when the dimensions are larger than the sample size.",2019,
An unusual edentulous pterosaur from the Early Cretaceous Romualdo Formation of Brazil,"Numerous taxa make up the Early Cretaceous fauna of Brazil, including Ornithocheiroidea, Tapejaridae, Thalassodromidae, Chaoyangopteridae and a purported member of Azhdarchidae. Dsungaripteridae has only been tentatively assumed to be present in the form of â€˜Santanadactylusâ€™ spixi. New study of NMSG SAO 251093 (a specimen referred to Thalassodromeus sethi) suggests it is a previously unknown species of dsungaripterid, Banguela oberlii, tax. nov., differing from Thalassodromeus and other pterosaurs from the Early Cretaceous of Brazil by a unique combination of characters, including an upturned jaw tip, a short dorsal mandibular symphyseal shelf (dmss), and an autapomorphic thin crest placed halfway along the fused mandibular symphysis without a keel along the ventral margin of the jaw. B. oberlii, tax. nov., is referred to Dsungaripteridae based on a dmss no longer than the ventral shelf, U-shaped caudal margin of the ventral shelf and lateral margins of the mandibular symphysis concave in dorsal view. B. oberlii, tax. nov., is the youngest known dsungaripterid, and expands known morphological diversity in the clade as well as the Early Cretaceous pterosaur fauna of South America.",2015,Historical Biology
"Palynofloras from the Liupanshan Group (cretaceous) at Anguo Town of Pingliang, Gansu","The Liupanshan Group is widely distributed and well exposed in the bordering areas of Shaanxi, Gansu and Ningxia, or the western margin of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Basin. A variety of spores and pollen are discovered during the present study of a section near Anguo Town, Pingliang, Gansu Province. Fifteen samples are found quite palyniferous from four of the five composing formations, e.g. the Sanqiao, Heshang- pu, Liwaxia, Madongshan and Naijiahe formations in ascending order with the basal one, Sanqiao Formation, as an exception. Gymnosperm pollen predominate the palynoassemblages except LD272, 271 and 206, in which fern spores prevail. The most abundant of this group is Classopollis, and others include Cycadopites, Ephedripites and Jugella. Saccate pollen of conifers is common but always in low percentages. Fern spores Cicatricosisporites is abundant and of high diversity, flourishing in a few samples. Schizaeoisporites acts in a similar way of Cicatricosisporites, but usually in lower percentages. Cyathidites and Lygodiumsporites are common in the assemblages. Compared with the assemblages discovered by Liu Zhaosheng (1983), which only refers to two formations of the Liupanshan Group, e.g. the Liwaxia Formation and the Naijiahe Formation, much more Cretaceous indicators are encountered in our study. They include Foraminisporis, Hsuisporites, Pilosisporites, Plicatella, Wulongspora, Yichangsporites, Coptospora, Jugella, Zhonghuapollis and Tricolpopollenites. Based on these taxa, especially the occurrence of angiosperm pollen Tricolpopollenites, a late Early Cretaceous age, e.g. Early to Middle Albian, is indicated though late Aptian may not be entirely ruled out. The xerophytic Schizaeoi- sporites, Classopollis, Ephedripites and Jugella occur abundantly and diversely in the palynoassemblages, especially in those of the Heshang- pu and Naijiahe formations. Thus an arid climate is indicated though semi- arid or periodic arid may be more likely for the Liwaxia and Madongshan formations. A comparison is made between the Liupanshan Group and the Zhidan Group deposited at the central Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Basin. That is, the Heshangpu, Liwaxia, Madongshan, and Naijiahe formations are correlative to the Jingchuan Formation, and the Sanqiao Formation to the Luohandong Formation. It thus indicates that the early Early Cretaceous sediments are unproductive at the marginal region of the basin.",2006,
Letter to the Editor regarding proteomic strategies and biomarker identification in melanoma.,"We read with great interest the recent article by Bougnoux and Solassol [1] on the contribution of proteomics to the identification of biomarkers for cutaneous malignant melanoma. The authors provided an updated overview of the biomarkers identified in melanoma through serum, cell lines, and tissue proteomic analysis [1]. However, their description of biomarker research in tissue samples is incompletely referenced and inadequately discussed, being limited to only two of a number of important studies from the scientific literature [1]. Melanoma tissue samples are a potentially valuable resource for both retrospective and prospective protein biomarker discovery studies, as they are widely available in pathology laboratories and linked to a wealth of clinical data, including patient outcomes and/or response to treatment. Proteomic studies of melanoma, and in particular of solid tumor/tissue samples, are indeed both relatively recent and limited [2]. However, the development of novel methods to efficiently extract cross-linked peptides has overcome themajor challenge for mass spectrometry (MS)-based strategies in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue [2]. In addition to the two studies cited by Bougnoux and Solassol [1], five other MS-based investigations to identify potential protein biomarkers have been accomplished on solid tumor samples from patients withmelanoma [2â€“6]. Some researchers, including ourselves, have used an integrated MS and immunohistochemistry-based method: (1) to confirm the validity of this approach, by documenting the presence of previously knownmelanoma-related proteins; (2) to identify novel proteins expressed in melanoma; and (3) to correlate the MS-discovery of proteins with their tissue distribution (i.e., tumor cells vs. stroma) and intracellular localization in tumor samples [2,4,6].",2013,Clinical biochemistry
Development of hemorrhage identification model using non-invasive vital signs.,"OBJECTIVE
Early detection and timely management of bleeding is critical as failure to recognize physiologically significant bleeding is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Many such instances are detected late, even in highly monitored environments, contributing to delay in recognition and intervention. We propose a non-invasive early identification model to detect bleeding events using continuously collected photoplethysmography (PPG) and electrocardiography (ECG) waveforms.


APPROACH
Fifty-nine York pigs undergoing fixed-rate, controlled hemorrhage were involved in this study and a Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression-based early detection model was developed and tested using PPG and ECG derived features. The output of the early detection model was a risk trajectory indicating the future probability of bleeding.


MAIN RESULTS
Our proposed models were generally accurate in predicting bleeding with an area under the curve of 0.89 (95% CI 0.87-0.92) and achieved the average time of 16.1 mins to detect 16.8% blood loss when a false alert rate of 1% was tolerated. Models developed on non-invasive data performed with similar discrimination and lead time to hemorrhage compared to models using invasive arterial blood pressure as monitoring data.


SIGNIFICANCE
A bleed detection model using only non-invasive monitoring performs as well as those using invasive arterial pressure monitoring.",2020,Physiological measurement
Assimilatory nitrate utilization by bacteria on the West Florida Shelf as determined by stable isotope probing and functional microarray analysis.,"Dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) uptake by marine heterotrophic bacteria has important implications for the global nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) cycles. Bacterial nitrate utilization is more prevalent in the marine environment than traditionally thought, but the taxonomic identity of bacteria that utilize nitrate is difficult to determine using traditional methodologies. (15) N-based DNA stable isotope probing was applied to document direct use of nitrate by heterotrophic bacteria on the West Florida Shelf. Seawater was incubated in the presence of 2 Î¼M (15) N ammonium or (15) N nitrate. DNA was extracted, fractionated via CsCl ultracentrifugation, and each fraction was analyzed by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP) analysis. TRFs that exhibited density shifts when compared to controls that had not received (15) N amendments were identified by comparison with 16S rRNA gene sequence libraries. Relevant marine proteobacterial lineages, notably Thalassobacter and Alteromonadales, displayed evidence of (15) N incorporation. RT-PCR and functional gene microarray analysis could not demonstrate the expression of the assimilatory nitrate reductase gene, nasA, but mRNA for dissimilatory pathways, i.e. nirS, nirK, narG, nosZ, napA, and nrfA was detected. These data directly implicate several bacterial populations in nitrate uptake, but suggest a more complex pattern for N flow than traditionally implied.",2012,FEMS microbiology ecology

Deepview: Virtual Disk Failure Diagnosis and Pattern Detection for Azure,"In Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), virtual machines (VMs) use virtual hard disks (VHDs) provided by a remote storage service via the network. Due to separation of VMs and their VHDs, a new type of failure, called VHD failure, which may be caused by various components in the IaaS stack, becomes the dominating factor that reduces VM availability. The current state-of-the-art approaches fall short in localizing VHD failures because they only look at individual components. In this paper, we designed and implemented a system called Deepview for VHD failure localization. Deepview composes a global picture of the system by connecting all the components together, using individual VHD failure events. It then uses a novel algorithm which integrates Lasso regression and hypothesis testing for accurate and timely failure localization. We have deployed Deepview at Microsoft Azure, one of the largest IaaS providers. Deepview reduced the number of unclassified VHD failure events from tens of thousands to several hundreds.

Stereotactic body radiotherapy for centrally located stageÂ I NSCLC,"PurposeThe purpose of this work is to analyze patterns of care and outcome after stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for centrally located, early-stage, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and to address the question of potential risk for increased toxicity in this entity.Methods and materialsA total of 90Â patients with centrally located NSCLC were identified among 613Â cases in a database of 13 German and Austrian academic radiotherapy centers. The outcome of centrally located NSCLC was compared to that of cases with peripheral tumor location from the same database.ResultsPatients with central tumors most commonly presented with UICC stageÂ IB (50â€‰%), while the majority of peripheral lesions were stageÂ IA (56â€‰%). Average tumor diameters were 3.3Â cm (central) and 2.8Â cm (peripheral). Staging PET/CT was available for 73 and 74â€‰% of peripheral and central tumors, respectively. Biopsy was performed in 84â€‰% (peripheral) and 88â€‰% (central) of cases. Doses varied significantly between central and peripheral lesions with a median BED10 of 72Â Gy and 84Â Gy, respectively (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). Fractionation differed as well with medians of 5 (central) and 3 (peripheral) fractions (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). In the Kaplanâ€“Meier analysis, 3-year actuarial overall survival was 29â€‰% (central) and 51â€‰% (peripheral; pâ€‰=â€‰0.004) and freedom from local progression was 52â€‰% (central) and 84â€‰% (peripheral; pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). Toxicity after treatment of central tumors was low with no grade III/IV and one gradeÂ V event. Mortality rates were 0 and 1â€‰% after 30 and 60Â days, respectively.ConclusionLocal tumor control in patients treated with SBRT for centrally located, early-stage NSCLC was favorable, provided ablative radiation doses were prescribed. This was, however, not the case in the majority of patients, possibly due to concerns about treatment-related toxicity. Reported toxicity was low, butÂ prospective trials are needed to resolve the existing uncertainties and to establish safe high-dose regimens for this cohort of patients.ZusammenfassungZielZiel dieser Arbeit war die Analyse von BehandlungsmodalitÃ¤ten und -ergebnissen nach stereotaktischer KÃ¶rperstrahlentherapie (â€žstereotactic body radiotherapyâ€œ, SBRT) bei zentral gelegenem nichtkleinzelligem Lungenkarzinom (â€žnon-small cell lung cancerâ€œ, NSCLC). Ebenfalls untersucht wurde, ob im Vergleich zu peripheren Tumoren ein erhÃ¶htes Risiko fÃ¼r posttherapeutische ToxizitÃ¤t besteht.Methoden und MaterialAus 613 BehandlungsfÃ¤llen einer Datenbank von 13 hochschulassoziierten Strahlentherapiezentren in Deutschland und Ã–sterreichÂ wurden insgesamt 90Â Patienten mit zentral gelegenen NSCLC identifiziert. Das Outcome der Patienten mit zentralem NSCLC wurde verglichen mit dem von Patienten aus derselben Datenbank mit peripherer Tumorlokalisation.ErgebnisseDie meisten zentralen Tumoren waren Karzinome im UICC-StadiumÂ IB (50â€‰%), die Mehrheit der peripher gelegenen LÃ¤sionen dagegen befand sich im StadiumÂ IA (56â€‰%). Die durchschnittlichen Tumordurchmesser betrugen 3,3Â cm (zentrale) bzw. 2,8Â cm (periphere). Staging-PET/CT-Aufnahmen gab es fÃ¼r 73 bzw. 74â€‰% der peripheren bzw. zentralen Tumoren, Biopsien fÃ¼r 84% (periphere) bzw. 88â€‰% (zentrale). Die Bestrahlungsdosen fÃ¼r zentrale und periphere LÃ¤sionen unterschieden sich signifikant voneinander, der BED10-Median lag bei 72 bzw. 84Â Gy (pâ€‰<â€‰0,001). Auch die Fraktionierung war unterschiedlich: die Mediane waren 5 (zentral) und 3 (peripher; p <â€‰0,001)Â Fraktionen. Nach Kaplan-Meier-Analyse lag das aktuarische DreijahresÃ¼berleben bei 29% (zentral) bzw. 51% (peripher; p =0,004), das lokal progressionsfreie Ãœberleben bei 52% (zentral) bzw. 84% (peripher; p <0,001). Die ToxizitÃ¤t nach der Therapie zentraler Tumoren war gering, es gab kein Grad-III/IV- und nur ein Grad-V-Ereignis. Die 30- bzw. 60-Tage-MortalitÃ¤tsraten lagen bei 0 bzw. 1%.FazitDie lokale Kontrolle von zentral gelegenen NSCLC im FrÃ¼hstadium durch SBRT war akzeptabel âˆ’ unter der Voraussetzung der Verwendung ablativer Strahlendosen. Dies war bei den meisten Patienten allerdings nicht der Fall, mÃ¶glicherweise wegen Bedenken Ã¼ber behandlungsbedingte ToxizitÃ¤t. Trotz der milden berichteten ToxizitÃ¤t sind prospektive Studien erforderlich, um die bestehenden Unsicherheiten zu beseitigen und sichere Hochdosisregime fÃ¼r Patienten mit zentralem NSCLC zu etablieren.",2014,Strahlentherapie und Onkologie

Automated computer vision system to predict body weight and average daily gain in beef cattle during growing and finishing phases,"Abstract Frequent measurements of body weight (BW) in livestock systems are very important because they allow assessing growth. However, real-time monitoring of animal growth through traditional weighing scales is stressful for animals, costly and labor-intensive. Thus, the objectives of this study were to: 1) assess the predictive quality of an automated computer vision system used to predict BW and average daily gain (ADG) in beef cattle; and 2) compare different predictive approaches, including Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Partial Least Squares (PLS), and Artificial Neutral Networks (ANN). A total of 234 images of Nellore beef cattle were collected during the weaning, stocker and feedlot phases. First, biometric body measurements of each animal, such as body volume, area, length, and others, were performed using three-dimensional images captured with the KinectÂ® sensor, and their respective BW were acquired using an electronic scale. Next, the biometric measurements were used as explanatory variables in the four predictive approaches (MLR, LASSO, PLS, and ANN). To evaluate prediction quality, a leave-one-out cross-validation was adopted. The ANN was the best prediction approach in terms of Root Mean Square Error of Prediction (RMSEP) and squared predictive correlation (r2). The results for Weaning were RMSEPÂ =Â 8.6Â kg and r2Â =Â 0.91; for Stocker phase, RMSEPÂ =Â 11.4Â kg and r2Â =Â 0.79; and for Beginning of feedlot, RMSEPÂ =Â 7.7Â kg and r2Â =Â 0.92. The ANN was also the best method for prediction of ADG, with RMSEPÂ =Â 0.02Â kg/d and r2Â =Â 0.67 for the period between Weaning and Stocker, RMSEPÂ =Â 0.02Â kg/d and r2Â =Â 0.85 for the Weaning and Beginning of Feedlot phase, RMSEPÂ =Â 0.03Â kg/d and r2Â =Â 0.80 for Weaning and Final of Feedlot phase, RMSEPÂ =Â 0.10Â kg/d and r2Â =Â 0.51 for Stocker and Beginning of feedlot phase, and RMSEPÂ =Â 0.09Â kg/d and r2Â =Â 0.82 for the Beginning and Final of feedlot phase. Overall, the results indicate that the proposed automated computer vision system can be successfully used to predict BW and ADG in real-time in beef cattle.",2020,Livestock Science

A Method of Estimating the [Î±/Fe] Ratios from Low-resolution Stellar Spectratwo,"Abstract A method for the determination of [Î±/Fe] from low-resolution stellar spectra is presented. The proposed scheme includes the following three steps: firstly, the spectrum is decomposed by the multi-scale Haar wavelet, and the high-frequency components are removed to suppress the high-frequency noise; then, based on the correlation of the spectral data component with [Î±/Fe], the spectral features are selected by the LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) algorithm; finally, [Î±/Fe] is measured by the multiple linear regression method based on the MARCS stellar spectrum library. The effectiveness of the method is verified with the low-resolution stellar spectra of ELODIE, SDSS (Sloan Digital Sky Survey), LAMOST (Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fibre Spectroscopic Telescope), and four star clusters. The systematic deviations and accuracies are as follows: (0.04Â dex, 0.064Â dex) for the 317 ELODIE spectra; (0.16Â dex, 0.065Â dex) for the 412 SDSS spectra; (0.05Â dex, 0.062Â dex) for the 1276 LAMOST spectra (with the signal-noise ratio in the g band (SNRG) greater than 20). The averages of [Î±/Fe] obtained for the likely members of the globular star clusters (M13, M15) and open star clusters (NGC2420, M67) are in agreement with the literature values.",2019,Chinese Astronomy and Astrophysics

Double/debiased machine learning for treatment and structural parameters,"We revisit the classic semiparametric problem of inference on a low dimensional parameter Î¸_0 in the presence of high-dimensional nuisance parameters Î·_0. We depart from the classical setting by allowing for Î·_0 to be so high-dimensional that the traditional assumptions, such as Donsker properties, that limit complexity of the parameter space for this object break down. To estimate Î·_0, we consider the use of statistical or machine learning (ML) methods which are particularly well-suited to estimation in modern, very high-dimensional cases. ML methods perform well by employing regularization to reduce variance and trading off regularization bias with overfitting in practice. However, both regularization bias and overfitting in estimating Î·_0 cause a heavy bias in estimators of Î¸_0 that are obtained by naively plugging ML estimators of Î·_0 into estimating equations for Î¸_0. This bias results in the naive estimator failing to be N^(-1/2) consistent, where N is the sample size. We show that the impact of regularization bias and overfitting on estimation of the parameter of interest Î¸_0 can be removed by using two simple, yet critical, ingredients: (1) using Neyman-orthogonal moments/scores that have reduced sensitivity with respect to nuisance parameters to estimate Î¸_0, and (2) making use of cross-fitting which provides an efficient form of data-splitting. We call the resulting set of methods double or debiased ML (DML). We verify that DML delivers point estimators that concentrate in a N^(-1/2)-neighborhood of the true parameter values and are approximately unbiased and normally distributed, which allows construction of valid confidence statements. The generic statistical theory of DML is elementary and simultaneously relies on only weak theoretical requirements which will admit the use of a broad array of modern ML methods for estimating the nuisance parameters such as random forests, lasso, ridge, deep neural nets, boosted trees, and various hybrids and ensembles of these methods. We illustrate the general theory by applying it to provide theoretical properties of DML applied to learn the main regression parameter in a partially linear regression model, DML applied to learn the coefficient on an endogenous variable in a partially linear instrumental variables model, DML applied to learn the average treatment effect and the average treatment effect on the treated under unconfoundedness, and DML applied to learn the local average treatment effect in an instrumental variables setting. In addition to these theoretical applications, we also illustrate the use of DML in three empirical examples.",2017,Econometrics Journal
Palynofacies and organic geochemistry of the Sinemurian carbonate deposits in the western Lusitanian Basin (Portugal): Coimbra and Ãgua de Madeiros formations,"Abstract The Lower Jurassic in the Lusitanian Basin (Portugal) is mainly represented by hemipelagic carbonated deposits rich in organic matter (OM). In this study, supported by a high-resolution stratigraphic and sedimentological framework, the analysis of the OM content of the Coimbra and Agua de Madeiros formations in the reference outcrop sections of S. Pedro de Moel and Peniche is presented. This is a multidisciplinary approach to the study of 31 samples in these series, supported by organic petrography [palynofacies, spore coloration index (SCI) and random vitrinite reflectance (%Rr)] and organic geochemistry [total organic carbon (TOC) and biomarkers]. The palynofacies analysis provides evidence that the OM is mainly composed of particles belonging to the amorphous organic matter (AOM) group. The phytoclasts correspond mostly to the non-opaque (translucent) subgroup, generally degraded and oxidized, with significant representation in some stratigraphic levels of the Coimbra Formation and the Polvoeira Member at Peniche. The palynomorphs are mainly composed of Classopollis pollen grains, zygospores, Acritarchs and Prasinophyte phycomata. The TOC data confirm that most samples are OM-rich, with some stratigraphic horizons of the Coimbra Formation reaching 8.8Â wt.%. The predominance of marine OM was confirmed by the Pr/nC17 and Ph/nC18 ratios. The Pr/Fi and homohopane ratios (C35/C34) indicate that some stratigraphic horizons were deposited under dysoxic-anoxic conditions. Despite the organic-rich nature of these two units, the random vitrinite reflectance (%RrÂ =Â 0.45), the spore coloration index (3.0â€“4 0) and the presence of Î²Î² hopanes suggest that these rocks, in terms of OM maturity, are thermally immature.",2013,International Journal of Coal Geology
A von Bertalanffy Growth Model with a Seasonally Varying Coefficient,"The von Bertalanffy model of body growth is inappropriate for organisms whose growth is restricted to a seasonal period because it assumes that growth rate is invariant with time. Incorporation of a time-varying coefficient significantly improves the capability of the von Bertalanffy equation to describe changing body size of both the bivalve mollusc Macoma balthica in San Francisco Bay and the flathead sole, Hippoglossoides elassodon, in Washington state. This simple modification of the von Bertalanffy model should offer improved predictions of body growth for a variety of other aquatic animals.

A note on accuracy of Bayesian LASSO regression in GWS,"Abstract Several genome wide selection (GWS) statistical methods have been proposed in the last years, and among these stands out the Bayesian LASSO (BL), which is a penalized regression method based on the regularization parameter (Î») estimates. In general, the posterior mean values for Î» are those that minimize the residual sum of squares (RSS) while controlling the L1 norm (absolute values) of the regression coefficients. However, another option is to use fixed values of Î», which is independent of this minimization process. Nevertheless, the most important aim of GWS is to make predictions about genomic breeding values (GBVÂ =Â u) for individuals that have not been measured directly for the trait, and for this reason the parameter to maximize should be the accuracy ( r u , u Ë† ). Thus, a question can arise as to whether such estimated Î» values that minimize RSS are the same as that which maximize r u , u Ë† . In order to answer this question, this paper aims to provide methodological and computational resources in order to evaluate the influence of BL regularization parameter estimates on the correlation between true and estimated GBV (accuracy) depending on genetic structure of the target trait (few or many QTLs and low or medium heritability). In general, it is possible to report, on average, that GBV prediction is robust in relation to the Î» estimation, since the different values for Î» lead to similar accuracy values. Moreover, the fixed Î» values grid request high computational costs, implying that the random Î» method is more attractive, since it is much faster to use just one Gibbs sampler run, while the grid must to use one run for each fixed Î» value.",2011,Livestock Science
Implementing genomic selection in sour passion fruit population,"Sour passion fruit is an economically important tropical fruit crop with little explored genetic potential. This study aimed to provide breeders with essential estimates of genomic breeding values in economically important traits in passion fruit, using Bayesian models which may contribute to the implementation of Genomic Selection and develop new strategies for the continuity of sour passion fruit breeding programs. For this, the following Bayesian models were tested using 183 polymorphic marks: Bayesian Ridge regression, Bayes A, Bayes B, Bayes B2, Bayes CÏ€ and Bayesian Lasso for estimation of genomic breeding values. To achieve this, ninety-five full-sib progenies derived from the third cycle of recurrent selection of the sour passion fruit (Passiflora edulis Sims.) at Universidade Estadual do Norte Fluminense Darcy Ribeiroâ€”UENF were used and eight fruit yield (number of fruit, total yield, mean fruit weight, fruit length, fruit width) and quality(percent pulp, skin thickness, soluble solids) traits were assessed. The Bayes CÏ€ (smaller deviance information criterion) yield the best genetic predictions for almost all traits. Genetic correlations in this study indicate that the number of fruit can be used as a proxy for yield. The values of genomic heritability obtained were high and ranged from 0.62 to 0.76 and predict accuracy ranged from 0.55 to 0.75, so we can to speculate that the use of two replicates in the present study was an adequate amount to obtain phenotypic mean, which was used to adjust the genomic prediction model.",2017,Euphytica
Methods for capturing and marking wild capybaras in Venezuela,"Abstract During a study of the social behavior of capybaras (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris), our goal was to reliably identify as many animals of all cohorts as possible in a population living in the Venezuelan Llanos. We used lassoing from horseback and 2 drug combinations to capture capybaras in the wild. We tested ear tags, expandable plastic collars, and tattoos as permanent marking techniques. Lassoing was more effective for capturing a large number of animals in a small area, while darting allowed a more selective capture. Ketamine plus N-(3â€²dimethylaminopropyl)-3-propionyl phenothiazine phosphate (combination A) and ketamine and medetomidine, with atipamezole as the reversal agent (combination B), were effective to immobilize capybaras but did not induce total anesthesia. Combination B was the least convenient because it caused a reduction in swimming ability and therefore a higher risk of drowning than combination A. The only permanent marking method was use of plastic ear tags.",2004,
Preface,"Statistical learning refers to a set of tools for modeling and understanding complex datasets. It is a recently developed area in statistics and blends with parallel developments in computer science and, in particular, machine learning. The field encompasses many methods such as the lasso and sparse regression, classification and regression trees, and boosting and support vector machines. With the explosion of â€œBig Dataâ€ problems, statistical learning has become a very hot field in many scientific areas as well as marketing, finance, and other business disciplines. People with statistical learning skills are in high demand. One of the first books in this areaâ€”The Elements of Statistical Learning (ESL) (Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman)â€”was published in 2001, with a second edition in 2009. ESL has become a popular text not only in statistics but also in related fields. One of the reasons for ESLâ€™s popularity is its relatively accessible style. But ESL is intended for individuals with advanced training in the mathematical sciences. An Introduction to Statistical Learning (ISL) arose from the perceived need for a broader and less technical treatment of these topics. In this new book, we cover many of the same topics as ESL, but we concentrate more on the applications of the methods and less on the mathematical details. We have created labs illustrating how to implement each of the statistical learning methods using the popular statistical software package R. These labs provide the reader with valuable hands-on experience. This book is appropriate for advanced undergraduates or masterâ€™s students in statistics or related quantitative fields or for individuals in other",2014,Discret. Appl. Math.

Fishes associated most frequently with the echinoid Diadema antillarum (34.3% of echinoids, six fish species, n = 146 echinoids), followed by Echinometra viridis (25.0%, three fish species, n = 12), Echinometra lucunter (7.5%, ten fish species, n = 1,834), Eucidaris tribuloides (3.4%, four fish species, n = 116), and Tripneustes ventricosus (7.1%, one fish species, n = 28). Of 196 fishes seeking shelter beside echinoids, Malacoctenus aurolineatus was the most common (41.8% of fishes, three echinoid species), followed by Stegastes adustus (38.8%, three echinoid species), Stegastes diencaeus (6.6%, three echinoid species), Sargocentron coruscum (6.1%, five echinoid species), Chaetodon capistratus (1.5%, one echinoid species), Gobioclinus filamentosus (1.5%, one echinoid species), Pomacanthus paru (1.0%, two echinoid species), Labrisomus nuchipinnis (1.0%, two echinoid species), Equetus punctatus (0.5%, one echinoid species), Microspathodon chryurus (0.5%, one echinoid species), and Thalassoma bifasciatum (0.5%, one echinoid species). None of the fishes associated exclusively with echinoids or was specialized for associating with echinoids, indicating the association was facultative. All fishes were small (< 12 cm). Fishes associated most frequently with the longest-spined echinoid, D. antillarum, supporting the hypothesis that fishes seek shelter among the spines of echinoids to benefit from increased protection from predation.",2019,
Are matching funds for smallholder irrigation money well spent,"Groundwater irrigation can dramatically affect agricultural production and productivity. Despite its potential as an agricultural development tool, little credible evidence exists for the impacts of groundwater development on smallholder agriculture. We add to the evidence on the benefits of irrigation investments for small producers by evaluating the Rural Business Development (RBD) program of the Millennium Challenge Corporation in Nicaragua for small plantain producers. The RBD program offered matching funds covering up to 30% of the cost of two years of inputs, extension services, and diesel-powered micro-sprinkler irrigation for individual farms. In order to estimate the average impact of the RBD program on its beneficiaries, we combine model selection via the LASSO with doubly robust treatment effect estimation as applied to two years of panel data for 146 producers. We find that the program had substantial impacts on plantain revenue and production, while achieving nearly complete irrigation coverage of plantain land among beneficiaries. We find no discernible impact on household expenditure.",2018,Food Policy
High-Throughput Analysis of Algal Crude Oils Using High,"Lipid analysis often needs to be specifically optimizedforeachclassofcompoundsduetoitswidevariety of chemical and physical properties. It becomes a serious bottleneck in the development of algae-based next genera- tion biofuels when high-throughput analysis becomes essential for the optimization of various process conditions. We propose a high-resolution mass spectrometry-based high-throughput assay as a 'quick-and-dirty' protocol to monitorvariouslipidclassesinalgalcrudeoils.Atmospheric pressure chemical ionization was determined to be most effective for this purpose to cover a wide range of lipid classes. With an autosampler-LC pump set-up, we could analyze algal crude samples every one and half minutes, monitoring several lipid species such as TAG, DAG, squa- lene, sterols, and chlorophyll a.

Comprehensive Proteomic Profilingâ€“derived Immunohistochemistry-based Prediction Models for BRCA1 and BRCA2 Germline Mutation-related Breast Carcinomas,"Heredity, mostly due to BRCA germline mutations, is involved in 5% to 10% of all breast cancer cases. Potential BRCA germline mutation carriers may be missed following the current eligibility criteria for BRCA genetic testing. The purpose of this study was to, therefore, develop an immunohistochemistry-based model to predict likelihood of underlying BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutations in unselected female breast cancer patients. The study group consisted of 100 BRCA1-related, 46 BRCA2-related, and 94 sporadic breast carcinomas. Tumor expression of 44 proteins involved in (BRCA-related) breast carcinogenesis was assessed by immunohistochemistry. A prediction model for BRCA-related versus nonâ€“BRCA-related breast cancer was developed using Lasso logistic regression analysis with cross-validation. The model was assessed for its discriminative value and clinical usefulness. The optimal prediction model included 14 predictors (age, cyclinD1, ER&agr;, ER&bgr;, FGFR2, FGFR3, FGFR4, GLUT1, IGFR, Ki67, mitotic activity index, MLH1, p120, and TOP2A), showed excellent discriminative performance (area under the receiving operating characteristic curve=0.943; 95% confidence interval=0.909-0.978), and reasonable calibration. To enhance possible implementation, we developed an alternative model only considering more widely available immunostains. This model included 15 predictors (age, BCL2, CK5/6, CK8/18, cyclinD1, E-cadherin, ER&agr;, HER2, Ki67, mitotic activity index , MLH1, p16, PMS2, PR, and vimentin), and still showed very good discriminative performance (area under the receiving operating characteristic curve=0.853; 95% confidence interval=0.795-0.911). We present a well-applicable and accurate tool to predict which breast cancer patients may have an underlying BRCA germline mutation, largely consisting of immunohistochemical markers independent of clinical characteristics. This may improve identification of potential BRCA germline mutation carriers and optimize referral for germline mutation testing.",2018,The American Journal of Surgical Pathology

A Comparison of Two-Stage Approaches Based on Penalized Regression for Estimating Gene Networks,"Graphical models are commonly used for illustrating gene networks. However, estimating directed networks are generally challenging because of the limited sample size compared with the dimensionality of an experiment. Many previous studies have provided insight into the problem, and recently, two-stage approaches have shown significant improvements for estimating directed acyclic graphs. These two-stage approaches find neighborhoods in the first stage and determine the directions of the edges in the second stage. However, although numerous methods to find neighborhoods and determine directions exist, the most appropriate method to use with two-stage approaches has not been evaluated. Therefore, we compared such methods through extensive simulations to select effective methods for the first and second stages. Results show that adaptive lasso is the most effective for both stages in most cases. In addition, we compared methods to handle asymmetric entries to estimate an undirected network. Some previous studies indicate that the method used to handle asymmetric entries does not affect performance significantly; however, we found that the selection of the handling method for such edges is a significant factor for finding neighborhoods when using adaptive lasso.",2017,Journal of computational biology : a journal of computational molecular cell biology
Dissolved organic constituents in coal-associated waters and implications for human and ecosystem health,"Decisions concerning the disposal or use of waters produced during the production of coal bed methane (CBM) are typically made based on water quality as expressed by the waterâ€™s salinity and/or inorganic ionic constituency. The quality of CBM water is frequently evaluated in terms of its suitability for irrigation. Water that has an acceptable salinity and sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) is considered safe for surface discharge and for potential injection into a drinking-water aquifer. It is important to remember, however, that water associated with coal seams, independent of its inorganic constituents, may contain dissolved organics and other constituents at levels that may adversely affect human health and the environment. It is well known that coal, lignite, or coaly materials present in aquifers used as drinking-water supplies are associated with adverse or potentially adverse human health effects. Water produced from coalassociated aquifers has been linked, or is suspected to be linked, to goiter, Balkan Endemic Nephropathy (BEN), multiple sclerosis, and increased rates of cancer morbidity and mortality. Water-soluble organic compounds found in coals include goitrogens such as the hydroxyphenols resorcinol, 2-methyl resorcinol, and 5-methylresorcinol (orcinol), as well as hydroxypyridines. Well waters containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), aniline, aminophenols, and aromatic amines leached from low-rank Pliocene coals may be the cause of, or a contributing factor to, BEN, an incurable interstitial nephropathy that is believed to have killed more than 100,000 people in the former Yugoslavia alone. There are few, if any, systematic and comprehensive analyses of dissolved organic compounds in CBM-produced water. Prudence suggests that the dissolved organic constituents in CBM-produced water should be systematically characterized, and their potential for harm to human health and the environment be evaluated before potentially harmful chemicals are discharged to the environment or released to drinking-water aquifers. a:\#120 fisher s-15-7.docf:\abyss\bfisher\ipec2002 coal bed th \ l h lth b Type in QMS QA ID no.",2002,
A novel catheter-guidance algorithm for localization of atrial fibrillation rotor and focal sources,"Locating atrial fibrillation (AF) focal and rotor sources can help improve target ablation therapy for AF. However, it remains unclear how to use the information provided by multi-polar diagnostic catheters (MPDC) to locate AF sources. Our aim was to develop a catheter-guidance algorithm to locate AF focal and rotor sources using a conventional MPDC. We simulated a 10 cm Ã— 10 cm atrial tissue with focal and rotor sources using the Nygren et al. ionic model. We modeled a Lasso MPDC with 20-unipole electrodes placed with a spacing of 4.5-1-4.5 mm (diameter, d=15 mm) along a circle to obtain 10-bipole electrograms. Staring from an initial location, the algorithm, which was blinded to the location and type of the AF source, iteratively advanced the MPDC by moving its center to the location of the first activated bipole (FAB). The algorithm located an AF source if a stopping condition for either source was satisfied using bipole electrogram characteristics extracted from the MPDC placement. We tested the algorithm for a single rotor and focal source for all possible initial positions on the simulated tissue and repeated it for a random placement with a maximum of 20 possible placements at every trial. The algorithm located the AF source for 100% of trials and on average required 5.99 Â± 1.92 placements to an AF source. This algorithm may be used to iteratively direct an MPDC towards an AF source and allow the AF source to be localized for customized AF ablation.",2016,2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)
Predictive ability of genomic selection models for breeding value estimation on growth traits of Pacific white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei,"Genomic selection (GS) can be used to accelerate genetic improvement by shortening the selection interval. The successful application of GS depends largely on the accuracy of the prediction of genomic estimated breeding value (GEBV). This study is a first attempt to understand the practicality of GS in Litopenaeus vannamei and aims to evaluate models for GS on growth traits. The performance of GS models in L. vannamei was evaluated in a population consisting of 205 individuals, which were genotyped for 6 359 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers by specific length amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) and phenotyped for body length and body weight. Three GS models (RR-BLUP, BayesA, and Bayesian LASSO) were used to obtain the GEBV, and their predictive ability was assessed by the reliability of the GEBV and the bias of the predicted phenotypes. The mean reliability of the GEBVs for body length and body weight predicted by the different models was 0.296 and 0.411, respectively. For each trait, the performances of the three models were very similar to each other with respect to predictability. The regression coefficients estimated by the three models were close to one, suggesting near to zero bias for the predictions. Therefore, when GS was applied in a L. vannamei population for the studied scenarios, all three models appeared practicable. Further analyses suggested that improved estimation of the genomic prediction could be realized by increasing the size of the training population as well as the density of SNPs.",2016,Chinese Journal of Oceanology and Limnology
Prediction of Recurrence in Cervical Cancer Using a Nine-lncRNA Signature,"Background and Objective
As a common cancer type in women, cervical cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-associated mortalities word wide. Recent evidence has demonstrated the regulatory role of a large number of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in cervical cancer. Here, we aimed to identify new biomarkers that related with the recurrence through comprehensive bioinformatics analysis.


Methods
Firstly, we collected online lncRNA expression data of cervical cancer patients which were divided into training, validation, and test set. Then we developed a nine-lncRNA signature from training set by conducting LASSO Cox regression model along with 10-fold cross validation. The prognostic value of this risk score was validated in all the three sets using Kaplan-Meier analysis, C-index, time-dependent ROC curves and dynamic AUC. Biological function of these lncRNAs in cervical cancer cells were evaluated by performing gene ontology biological process enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes signaling pathways analysis.


Results
According to the results, a higher predict accuracy was observed in the nine-lncRNA signature than that of FIGO stage in all the three sets. Stratified analysis also demonstrated that the nine-lncRNA signature can predict the recurrence of cervical cancer within FIGO stage. The potential mechanisms underlying the nine-lncRNAs from the signature were also identified according to the gene enrichment analysis.


Conclusion
In the present article, we provided a reliable prognostic tool to facilitate the individual management of patients with cervical cancer after treatment.",2019,Frontiers in Genetics
An exploratory study of populism: the municipality-level predictors of electoral outcomes in Italy,"We present an exploratory machine learning analysis of populist votes at municipality level in the 2018 Italian general elections, in which populist parties gained almost 50% of the votes. Starting from a comprehensive set of local characteristics, we use an algorithm based on BIC to obtain a reduced set of predictors for each of the two populist parties (Five-Star Movement and Lega) and the two traditional ones (Democratic Party and Forza Italia). Differences and similarities between the sets of predictors further provide evidence on 1) heterogeneity in populisms, 2) if this heterogeneity is related to the traditional left/right divide. The Five-Star Movement is stronger in larger and unsafer municipalities, where people are younger, more unemployed and work more in services. On the contrary, Lega thrives in smaller and safer municipalities, where people are less educated and employed more in manufacturing and commerce. These differences do not correspond to differences between the Democratic Party and Forza Italia, providing evidence that heterogeneity in populisms does not correspond to a left/right divide. As robustness tests, we use an alternative machine learning technique (lasso) and apply our predictions to France as to confront them with candidates' actual votes in 2017 presidential elections.",2019,
A CNN-RNN Framework for Crop Yield Prediction,"Crop yield prediction is extremely challenging due to its dependence on multiple factors such as crop genotype, environmental factors, management practices, and their interactions. This paper presents a deep learning framework using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for crop yield prediction based on environmental data and management practices. The proposed CNN-RNN model, along with other popular methods such as random forest (RF), deep fully connected neural networks (DFNN), and LASSO, was used to forecast corn and soybean yield across the entire Corn Belt (including 13 states) in the United States for years 2016, 2017, and 2018 using historical data. The new model achieved a root-mean-square-error (RMSE) 9% and 8% of their respective average yields, substantially outperforming all other methods that were tested. The CNN-RNN has three salient features that make it a potentially useful method for other crop yield prediction studies. (1) The CNN-RNN model was designed to capture the time dependencies of environmental factors and the genetic improvement of seeds over time without having their genotype information. (2) The model demonstrated the capability to generalize the yield prediction to untested environments without significant drop in the prediction accuracy. (3) Coupled with the backpropagation method, the model could reveal the extent to which weather conditions, accuracy of weather predictions, soil conditions, and management practices were able to explain the variation in the crop yields.",2019,Frontiers in Plant Science

NEEDLE INSERTION FOR ROBOTIC SURGERY By CEÌLINE LAPLASSOTTE A THESIS PRESENTED TO THE GRADUATE SCHOOL OF THE UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA IN PARTIAL FULFILLMENT OF THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE DEGREE OF MASTER OF SCIENCE UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,"of Thesis Presented to the Graduate School of the University of Florida in Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree of Master of Science NEEDLE INSERTION FOR ROBOTIC SURGERY By CÃ©line Laplassotte August 2012 Chair: Warren E. Dixon Major: Mechanical Engineering Many modern clinical practices involve percutaneous needle insertion. This thesis focuses on modeling and automation aspects related to robotic needle insertion. Medical robotics may offer methods for improving such practices. The first contribution is the development of a controller to ensure that a needle tip tracks a trajectory beginning in a non-contact position and ending within viscoelastic tissue. Through employment of a sliding mode controller and a neural network (NN), the controller guarantees semi-global asymptotic tracking of the desired trajectory. The second contribution is the development of a controller to ensure that a needle tip mounted on a slave robot tracks the trajectory given by the surgeon manipulating the master robot, in the presence of uncertainties in the user and environment forces. The control development leads to semi-global asymptotic tracking of the desired trajectory using a sliding mode controller and a NN. Lyapunov-based stability analysis and simulations are provided to demonstrate the performance of the control designs throughout the thesis.",2012,
"Clostridium difficile colitis in the United States: a decade of trends, outcomes, risk factors for colectomy, and mortality after colectomy.","BACKGROUND
Clostridium difficile colitis (CDC) is a major health concern in the United States (US), with earlier reports demonstrating a rising incidence. Studies analyzing predictors for total colectomy and mortality after colectomy are limited by small numbers.


STUDY DESIGN
The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) 2001 to 2010 was retrospectively reviewed for CDC trends, the associated colectomy and mortality rates. Patient and hospital variables were used in the LASSO algorithm for logistic regression with 10-fold cross validation to build a predictive model for colectomy requirement and mortality after colectomy. The association of colectomy day with mortality was also examined on multivariable logistic regression analysis.


RESULTS
An estimated 2,773,521 discharges with a diagnosis of CDC were identified in the US over a decade. Colectomy was required in 19,374 cases (0.7%), with an associated mortality of 30.7%. Compared with the 2001 to 2005 period, the 2006 to 2010 period witnessed a 47% increase in the rate of CDC and a 32% increase in the rate of colectomies. The LASSO algorithm identified the following predictors for colectomy: coagulopathy (odds ratio [OR] 2.71), weight loss (OR 2.25), teaching hospitals (OR 1.37), fluid or electrolyte disorders (OR 1.31), and large hospitals (OR 1.18). The predictors of mortality after colectomy were: coagulopathy (OR 2.38), age greater than 60 years (OR 1.97), acute renal failure (OR 1.67), respiratory failure (OR 1.61), sepsis (OR 1.40), peripheral vascular disease (OR 1.39), and congestive heart failure (OR 1.25). Surgery more than 3 days after admission was associated with higher mortality rates (OR 1.09; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.14; p < 0.05).


CONCLUSIONS
Clostridium difficile colitis is increasing in the US, with an associated increase in total colectomies. Mortality rates after colectomy remain elevated. Progression to colectomy and mortality thereafter are associated with several patient and hospital factors. Knowledge of these risk factors may help in risk-stratification and counseling.",2013,Journal of the American College of Surgeons

L'ecofeminisme a une caracteristique multi-culturelle impliquant a la fois la dualite de la nature-culture et celle de la femme-homme. De nos jours, il devient un mouvement social, international qui accuse en particulier l'oppression de la femme et celle de la nature dans la culture moderne. En fait, il y a beaucoup de categories dans l'ecofeminisme et nous observons entre autres un sens spirituel d'ecofeminisme, ce qui est enfin une solution pour dissoudre le dualisme de la societe du risque. L'ecofeminisme siprituel affirme que le lieu de la memoire touchant a l'instinct (ou a la destinee) humain(e) n'est rien que de la terre, de la nature. Son etude sur la deesse nous permet de rencontrer la sagesse antique plongee dans ses racines de la terre-mere et de la decouvrir de nouveau dans notre propre substance. Les deesses comme Demeter et Gaia symbolisent la terre-mere-source, la matrice de toutes les valeurs. Les ecofeministes revendiquent la resurrection de ces deesses antiques pour sauver la terre devastee par les hommes, pour retrouver la correspondande sprituelle entre la nature et l'humain et pour prouver que la femme n'a pas lieu d'etre soumise a l'homme. Ensuite les ecofeministes approfondissent en quelque sorte le feminisme francais concernant un trio de â€˜femme-corps-ecritureâ€™. Ce qui importe pour les ecofeministes, c'est que la femme comprend son experience feminine (conception, accouchement, allaitement, etc) comme la loi de la nature et identifie davantage avec la nature. Ces ecofeministes croient que si le corps feminin retrouve sa valeur par rapport a la nature, la femme peut s'ecarter de l'oppression absurde de la societe masculine et s'atteindre a la veritable liberation. L'ecofeminisme est une sorte de philosophie de la liberation qui a pour objectif de dissoudre tous les elements dualistes qui renforcent la maitrise sociale sur les corps de la terre et de la femme. Finalement notre etude passe a l'analyse litteraire ecofeministe. Dans le roman Poisson d'or de Le Clezio, Laila (heroine, jeune fille noire kidnappee a l'age de 6 ans) ne vit pas sa vie en tant que sujet de son existence(surtout de son corps) et reste toujours autrui, etrangere et esclave autour du monde. Elle redoute â€˜tant de lassos et de filets' des hommes et ne cesse de fuir comme un poisson d'or. Au cours de cette fuite, elle regrette sa terre-mere, lieu de ses racines, et enfin retrouve sa liberte, son amour et sa force au sein de cette terre. Laila qui vient de comprendre la sagesse de la terre devient sujet actif de sa propre vie et deesse de nos jours, si bien que la nature est harmonieusement introduite dans notre culture. L'itineraire de Laila nous montre bien que la deesse de la terre, l'ame de la nature existe intacte pour eternite et attend toujours la reconciliation avec nous. C'est justement le message principal de la â€˜revolution des vertsâ€™ que l'ecofeminisme revendique. En realite, l'ecofeminisme en tant que sous-genre du feminisme n'est pas encore bien anime. Pourtant l'ecofeminisme qui apprecie la valeur de la nature ainsi que celle de la femme pourra etre la meilleure solution qui complete la faiblesse du feminisme se focalisant sur le feminin a part.",2005,
Adaptive variable selection for extended Nijboerâ€“Zernike aberration retrieval via lasso,"Abstract In this paper, we propose extended Nijboerâ€“Zernike (ENZ) method for aberration retrieval by incorporating lasso variable selection method which can improve the accuracy of aberration retrieval.

Structured Variable Selection in Support Vector Machines,"When applying the support vector machine (SVM) to high- dimensional classification problems, we often impose a sparse structure in the SVM to eliminate the influences of the irrelevant predictors. The lasso and other variable selection techniques have been successfully used in the SVM to perform automatic variable selection. In some problems, there is a natural hierarchical structure among the variables. Thus, in or- der to have an interpretable SVM classifier, it is important to respect the heredity principle when enforcing the sparsity in the SVM. Many variable selection methods, however, do not respect the heredity principle. In this paper we enforce both sparsity and the heredity principle in the SVM by using the so-called structured variable selection (SVS) framework originally proposed in (20). We minimize the empirical hinge loss under a set of linear inequality constraints and a lasso-type penalty. The solution always obeys the desired heredity principle and enjoys sparsity. The new SVM classi- fier can be efficiently fitted, because the optimization problem is a linear program. Another contribution of this work is to present a nonparametric extension of the SVS framework, and we propose nonparametric heredity SVMs. Simulated and real data are used to illustrate the merits of the proposed method.",2008,Electronic Journal of Statistics

Stylized Facts on Price Formation on Corporate Bonds and Best Execution Analysis,"The goal of this paper is to establish a benchmark for transaction cost analysis in bond trading for retail investors. Investors can use this benchmark to improve decisions when requesting quotes from dealers on electronic platforms. This benchmark is constructed in two steps. The first step is to identify abnormal trades by approximating the market liquidity using different statistical regression methods: OLS, two-step LASSO and Elastic Net. The second step is to estimate the amplitude and the decay pattern of price impact using non-parametric methods. A key discovery is the price impact asymmetry between customer-buy orders and costumer sell orders: customer buy orders have a larger price impact than customer sell orders. We show that this asymmetry is statistically significant.",2019,arXiv: Statistical Finance

Comunque, una volta impostosi a vario titolo il tema della traduzione nella cultura contemporanea, Ã¨ stato naturale guardarsi indietro e cercare di delineare una storia delle idee sulla traduzione nel passato remoto e prossimo, trovando in questo modo precursori o antenati illustri, anche se spesso il loro contributo si Ã¨ limitato a frammenti o ad opinioni espresse in margine ad opere dedicate ad altri argomenti, oppure come chiose dei propri lavori di traduzione. This journal article is available in International Gramsci Journal: http://ro.uow.edu.au/gramsci/vol1/iss2/5 International Gramsci Journal No. 2 April 2010 21 Croce, Gentile e Gramsci sulla traduzione Domenico Jervolino (UniversitÃ  di Napoli) in Croce filosofo, a cura di G. Cacciatore, G. Cotroneo, R. Viti Cavaliere, 2 voll., Rubettino, Soveria Mannelli 2003 (ma 2005), vol. 2, pp. 431-441. Lâ€™attivitÃ  del tradurre Ã¨ tanto antica quanto la storia della civiltÃ  umana nel suo complesso, ma il tema della traduzione solo nella seconda metÃ  del secolo ventesimo Ã¨ diventato oggetto di una disciplina specifica, secondo alcuni, o meglio di un ampio campo di studi interdisciplinari, dalla linguistica alla semiotica, dalla critica letteraria alla letteratura comparata, alla stessa filosofia in anni piÃ¹ recenti, sino al punto che si Ã¨ potuto parlare di un tournant philosophique de la traduction da parte di uno dei primi studiosi di traduzione in Francia. Comunque, una volta impostosi a vario titolo il tema della traduzione nella cultura contemporanea, Ã¨ stato naturale guardarsi indietro e cercare di delineare una storia delle idee sulla traduzione nel passato remoto e prossimo, trovando in questo modo precursori o antenati illustri, anche se spesso il loro contributo si Ã¨ limitato a frammenti o ad opinioni espresse in margine ad opere dedicate ad altri argomenti, oppure come chiose dei propri lavori di traduzione. Questa storia che, per quel che riguarda la civiltÃ  occidentale, parte almeno dagli antichi Romani, piÃ¹ attenti dei Greci alla necessitÃ  e allâ€™importanza del tradurre, giunge fino al primo Novecento, alla vigilia dellâ€™esplosione del tema della traduzione, di cui abbiamo fatto cenno. Esso coinvolge con brevi scritti, ma in modo significativo, i due maggiori filosofi â€œufficialiâ€ del periodo, i due dioscuri del neoidealismo italiano, Croce e Gentile, ma in un modo tutto particolare anche quel filosofo di genere molto speciale, che divenne tale operando in un contesto del tutto eccezionale, nellâ€™accademia delle lotte politiche e delle patrie galere, cioÃ¨ Antonio Gramsci. 1. Croce appartiene a quel ristretto numero di personalitÃ  che abbiano detto qualcosa di rilevante sulla traduzione nel periodo che precede gli studi contemporanei, secondo lâ€™autore di uno dei libri piÃ¹ significativi e fortunati sul tema pubblicati nella seconda metÃ  del secolo, George Steiner. Questâ€™ultimo distingue un primo, lungo periodo che va dagli Antichi fino ai primi dellâ€™Ottocento, caratterizzato da un approccio sostanzialmente empirico al problema della traduzione, da un secondo che va da Schleiermacher fino alla metÃ  del Novecento, dove le considerazioni sulla traduzione sono inserite in un contesto piÃ¹ ampio di idee sul linguaggio e lâ€™interpretazione. Il tema con cui Croce Ã¨ entrato con forza nella galleria degli antenati illustri della fase attuale (che costituirebbe per Steiner un terzo periodo) Ã¨ quello della intraducibilitÃ  (che come i lettori dellâ€™opera di Steiner sanno, Ã¨ addirittura citata in italiano) delle opere dâ€™arte. Lâ€™â€œintraducibileâ€ Ã¨ del resto un elemento dialettico che appartiene di diritto al campo della teoria della traduzione. Lâ€™intraducibilitÃ  di principio delle opere dâ€™arte Ã¨ una tesi ben nota della Estetica crociana, che sviluppa la concezione dellâ€™arte come intuizione-espressione, attivitÃ  teoretica peculiare dello spirito distinta da quella logica (e in quanto gradino inferiore della attivitÃ  conoscitiva, distinta, insieme alla logica, dalla pratica, a sua volta articolata in economica ed etica). 1 Cfr. J.-R. Ladmiral, Traduire. ThÃ©orÃ¨mes pour la traduction, Gallimard, Paris 1994, p. XIII. 2 Cfr. G. Steiner, Dopo Babele, tr. it. di R. Bianchi e C. BÃ©guin, Garzanti, Milano 1994, p. 288. Croce, Gentile e Gramsci sulla traduzione 22 Lâ€™intuizione-espressione artistica Ã¨ irripetibile nella sua creativitÃ  ogni volta rinnovata. â€œOgni vera intuizione o rappresentazione Ã¨, insieme, espressione. CiÃ² che non si oggettiva in unâ€™espressione non Ã¨ intuizione o rappresentazione, ma sensazione e naturalitÃ . Lo spirito non intuisce se non facendo, formando, esprimendo. Chi separa intuizione da espressione, non riesce mai piÃ¹ a congiungerleâ€. Il fatto estetico, in quanto tale, esaurendosi tutto nellâ€™elaborazione espressiva delle impressioni, non ha nulla a che fare con qualsiasi elemento pratico, sino al punto che diventa qualcosa di inessenziale anche lâ€™esteriorizzazione in unâ€™opera sussistente nel mondo materiale (quadro, statua ecc.) di ciÃ² che Ã¨ interiormente intuito. Peraltro, lâ€™espressione non Ã¨ divisibile in modi o gradi. Tutto il patrimonio tradizionale delle partizioni retoriche viene in questo modo relegato nel campo di ciÃ² che Ã¨ privo di valore dal punto di vista di unâ€™estetica filosofica. â€œI singoli fatti espressivi sono altrettanti individui, lâ€™uno non ragguagliabile con lâ€™altro, se non nella comune qualitÃ  di espressione. Per adoperare il linguaggio delle scuole, lâ€™espressione Ã¨ una specie che non puÃ² fungere a sua volta da genere. Variano le impressioni ossia i contenuti; ogni contenuto Ã¨ diverso da ogni altro, perchÃ© niente si ripete nella vita; e al variare continuo dei contenuti corrisponde la varietÃ  irriducibile delle forme espressive, sintesi estetiche delle impressioniâ€. Qui il Croce inserisce come corollario la tesi dellâ€™intraducibilitÃ  delle opere dâ€™arte. Ogni traduzione, infatti, come tentativo di nuova espressione di ciÃ² che giÃ  ha trovato la sua singolare espressione nellâ€™originale, o crea una diversa opera dâ€™arte o Ã¨ espressione deficitaria rispetto allâ€™originale, risultando priva di valore estetico e quindi avendo solo il carattere di un commento, di una parafrasi, di unâ€™approssimazione piÃ¹ o meno riuscita allâ€™originale. La tesi non Ã¨ nuova, anzi ha precedenti illustri: per restare nellâ€™ambito delle patrie lettere basterebbe ricordare il Dante del Convivio. In effetti, la traduzione del linguaggio poetico incontra limiti e difficoltÃ  che tutti gli studiosi hanno rilevato, fornendo varie risposte (il che non ha impedito che si continuasse a tradurre e che si traducessero anche le opere poetiche). Ma in Croce la tesi dellâ€™impossibilitÃ  della traduzione diventa un elemento necessario per la coerenza del sistema. Il fatto empirico dellâ€™attivitÃ  traduttrice e dellâ€™esistenza di traduzioni conta poco in una filosofia che esclude dalla rilevanza estetica tutto ciÃ² che risulta esteriore rispetto allâ€™intuizioneespressione spirituale. â€œOgni traduzione [...] o sminuisce e guasta, ovvero crea una nuova espressione, rimettendo la prima nel crogiuolo e mescolandola con le impressioni personali di colui che si chiama traduttore. Nel primo caso lâ€™espressione resta sempre una, quella dellâ€™originale, essendo lâ€™altra piÃ¹ o meno deficiente, cioÃ¨ non propriamente espressione: nellâ€™altro saranno sÃ¬ due, ma di due contenuti diversi. â€˜Brutte fedeli o belle infedeliâ€™â€. Il Croce dellâ€™Estetica svolge con rigore la sua tesi, attenuandone solo le conseguenze piÃ¹ radicali, nel momento in cui afferma che, come gli individui possono assomigliarsi tra di loro, pur restando diversi lâ€™uno dallâ€™altro, si puÃ² pensare di fondare in tale somiglianza la â€œpossibilitÃ  relativa delle traduzioniâ€. â€œLa traduzione, che si dice buona, Ã¨ unâ€™approssimazione, che ha valore originario di opera dâ€™arte e puÃ² stare da sÃ©â€. 6 3 B.

In un altro testo crociano importante, nel volume La Poesia del 1936, il mantenimento della tesi dellâ€™Estetica si accompagna con la disponibilitÃ  a concedere, senza riserve, la traducibilitÃ  dal punto di vista teoretico: â€œNon vâ€™ha dubbio che la sfera in cui ha luogo il tradurre sia quella dellâ€™espressione prosastica, che si adempie per simboli e segni. Questi segni sono permutabili, secondo che torna comodo; e non solo quelli della matematica, della fisica e delle altre scienze, ma anche quelli della filosofia e della storiaâ€. Del tradurre qui viene data una definizione limpidamente legata a â€œlâ€™equivalenza dei segni per la reciproca comprensione e intelligenzaâ€, soltanto questo â€œstabilire lâ€™equivalenza dei segniâ€ Ã¨ veramente tradurre.

Lasso solution strategies for the vehicle routing problem with pickups and deliveries,"This paper considers the vehicle routing problem with pickups and deliveries (VRPPD) where the same customer may require both a delivery and a pickup. This is the case, for instance, of breweries that deliver beer or mineral water bottles to a set of customers and collect empty bottles from the same customers. It is possible to relax the customary practice of performing a pickup when delivering at a customer, and postpone the pickup until the vehicle has sufficient free capacity. In the case of breweries, these solutions will often consist of routes in which bottles are first delivered until the vehicle is partly unloaded, then both pickup and delivery are performed at the remaining customers, and finally empty bottles are picked up from the first visited customers. These customers are revisited in reverse order, thus giving rise to lasso shaped solutions. Another possibility is to relax the traditional problem even more and allow customers to be visited twice either in two different routes or at different times on the same route, giving rise to a general solution. This article develops a tabu search algorithm capable of producing lasso solutions. A general solution can be reached by first duplicating each customer and generating a Hamiltonian solution on the extended set of customers. Test results show that while general solutions outperform other solution shapes in term of cost, their computation can be time consuming. The best lasso solution generated within a given time limit is generally better than the best general solution produced with the same computing effort.",2009,Eur. J. Oper. Res.
Notes on Discrete Compound Poisson Point Process and Its Concentration Inequalities,"The first part of this notes provides a new characterization for discrete compound Poisson point process (proposed by {Acz{\'e}l} [Acta~Math.~Hungar.~3(3)(1952), 219-224.]), which extends the characterization of Poisson point process given by Copeland and Regan [Ann.~Math.~(1936): 357-362.]. Next, we derive some concentration inequalities for discrete compound Poisson random variable and discrete compound Poisson point process (Poisson and negative binomial are the special cases). These concentration inequalities are potentially useful. In high-dimensional negative binomial regression with weighted Lasso penalty, we give the application that KKT conditions of penalized likelihood holds with high probability.",2017,arXiv: Statistics Theory
Random Lasso.,"We propose a computationally intensive method, the random lasso method, for variable selection in linear models. The method consists of two major steps. In step 1, the lasso method is applied to many bootstrap samples, each using a set of randomly selected covariates. A measure of importance is yielded from this step for each covariate. In step 2, a similar procedure to the first step is implemented with the exception that for each bootstrap sample, a subset of covariates is randomly selected with unequal selection probabilities determined by the covariates' importance. Adaptive lasso may be used in the second step with weights determined by the importance measures. The final set of covariates and their coefficients are determined by averaging bootstrap results obtained from step 2. The proposed method alleviates some of the limitations of lasso, elastic-net and related methods noted especially in the context of microarray data analysis: it tends to remove highly correlated variables altogether or select them all, and maintains maximal flexibility in estimating their coefficients, particularly with different signs; the number of selected variables is no longer limited by the sample size; and the resulting prediction accuracy is competitive or superior compared to the alternatives. We illustrate the proposed method by extensive simulation studies. The proposed method is also applied to a Glioblastoma microarray data analysis.",2011,The annals of applied statistics
Some species of Smicronyx (Coleoptera:Curculionidae) associated with Cuscuta species (Convolvulaceae) in Pakistan.,"The 7 species of Smicronyx found in association with dodders ( Cuscida spp. ) in Pakistan are separated in a key, and 5 of them are described as new. All available records on their biology and distribution are summarized, and tlie apparent relatedness of 3 of them to species associated with parasitic Scrophulariaceae is noted. The following descriptions, notes, and key are based primarily upon specimens of Smicronyx (subg. Smicronyx) Schoenherr, collected or reared in the course of studies conducted by Dr. M. A. Ghani on insects with potential as biological control agents against dodders (Cuscuta spp.) in Pakistan. I have prepared them in answer to a need for names for several undescribed species represented in that material and to provide a means of identifying the Smicronyx species known to be associated with dodders in Pakistan. In determining the status of the species included in this study, I examined 1 or more examples from the type series of 4 of the 6 species described from the Oriental Region and of 4 of the 5 species described from the nearby Turkestan area of the Palearctic Region. These species are Smicronyx anthracimis Faust, S. balassogloi Faust, S. ])itiiberciilatus Faust, S. centropustulatus Faust, S. praecox Faust, S. rohustus Faust, S. roridus Marshall, and S. tataricus Faust. I also examined descriptions and identified specimens of the remaining 2 Oriental species. For a recent diagnostic description of the genus Smicronyx, see Hoffmann ( 1958 ) , who also distinguished it from Sharpia Tournier, the other genus of the tribe Smicronychini known to occur in Pakistan.

The Breeding Habits of Sea Snakes,"IN a paper by the late Dr. Kopstein (1938) on the eggs of the reptiles of Java, the only note with regard to the sea snakes is that two female Thalassophis, caught in November, 1928, at Cheribon, contained respectively two and four embryos. In her catalogue of reptiles, de Rooy (1916) gives no information other than the statement that these snakes are viviparous, and in the best monograph available for the group, Malcolm Smith (1926) makes the following statement: ""Breeding appears to take place at certain seasons of the year only, but information upon this point is scanty. In the gulf of Siam the majority of the species produce their young during March and April."" Since 1936 we have collected sea snakes at Sourabaya, Java, which have been weighed, fixed in Bouin's liquid (Bergman, 1938), and opened ventrally. Measurements have been taken of the internal organs of these specimens. This material has become sufficiently extensive for preliminary report. It appears that there is no great diversity of genera at Sourabaya. Only the following five are represented. Thalassophina viperina is represented by one specimen only; Thalassophis anomalus, Lapemis hardwickii, Hydrophis fasciatus atriceps and Hydrophis brookii may be caught in any desired quantity; Enhydrina schistosa and Hydrophis cyanocinctus are not found in large numbers, and only one or two are caught at a time. Some other species of Hydrophis are represented in our collection by three or four specimens only; like the Thalassophina viperina, they are disregarded in the present investigation.

Variable selection via the grouped weighted lasso for factor analysis models,"The L1 regularization such as the lasso has been widely used in regression analysis since it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly zero, which leads to variable selection. We consider the problem of variable selection for factor analysis models via the L1 regularization procedure. In order to select variables each of which is controlled by multiple parameters, we treat parameters as grouped parameters and then apply the grouped lasso. Crucial issues in this modeling procedure include the selection of the number of factors and regularization parameters. Choosing these parameters can be viewed as a model selection and evaluation problem. We derive a model selection criterion for evaluating a factor analysis model via the grouped lasso. The proposed procedure produces estimates that lead to variable selection and also selects the number of factors objectively. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed procedure. A real data example is also given to illustrate our procedure.",2010,MI Preprint Series
Income Bipolarization and Poverty: Evidence from Rural Nigeria,"The disappearance of the middle class- income bipolarization could result into tension and social conflict. If such conflict starts in the rural area, the possible resulting revolts would clog the wheel of economic production and policy implementation and there is possibility of spreading to the urban area. The study therefore estimated income bipolarization in the rural area of Nigeria from 1980 to 2004 using Foster-Wolfson -FW- (1994) and Lasso de le Vega and Urrutia - LU- (2006) indices. Bipolarization linked poverty was estimated for the periods through the later and Foster-Wolfson bipolarization estimates were linked with the poverty status and other socio-economic features of the rural households by tobit regression analysis. Bipolarization was found to be on reduction from 1992 to 2004 moving in the direction of poverty level. FW Bipolarization was 0.6125, 0.4067, 0.4775, 0.4108 and 0.3529 in 1980, 1985, 1992, 1996 and 2004 while LU Bipolarization was 0.1676, 0.1430, 0.1610, 0.1460 and 0.1383 for the same years respectively. Poverty has highest significant positive effect on bipolarization with a marginal effect of 0.02520. The marginal effects of age was 0.00014, female head households was 0.00119. Household size, father's education, mother education, married status, farming and wage employment have significant negative marginal effects of 0.00037, 0.00027, 0.00013, 0.00636, 0.000697 and 0.00105 respectively. Income bipolarization is higher among households located in the South than their base category, the north. Poverty and its covariates have higher sum total interactive positive effect on bipolarization than their base categories, the non-poor covariates. There is need to reduce poverty for bipolarization to decline. The southern part needs more attention in bipolarization reduction strategies. All variables that reduce poverty like education would have to be harnessed further to reduce bipolarization to guide against the occurrence of its consequences. (Oluwole I. Ogunyemi & Omobowale A.

"Mechanization of fishing operations by fixed gears: report on tests perfomed by two ""Automation System"" for bottom longlines in the Southern Adriatic and Northeasternn Ionian Seas","En During years 1991 â€“ 1993 tests were intermittently carried out along the Apulian coast and in the NE Ionian Sea to assess the fishing performances of two ""mechanization systems"" for bottom longlines when operating at different depths. However, most data pertain to the period late June â€“ late September 1993 during which a more continuos series of wellâ€“handled fishing trials were perfomed. Our data showed that one of the mechanization systems being experimented effectively baited 70%-90% ca of the available hooks when hard and softâ€“flesh fish were respectively used. Fishing yelds mainly ranged from 5 to 10 individuals and from 3 to 7 kilograms foe each hundred baited hooks. These yelds were low when compared with the output of two fishing operations carried out by means of one standard commercial longline. Nevertheless, experimental yields are supposed to be economically viable because of the high numbers of hooks that wellâ€“trained crews are expected to set daily using the automation systems. In terms of number of individuals catches from experimental longlines were mainly composed of Scorpenids, Mediterranean hakes, conger eels and Selachians. Several clusters of fishes were outlined from our fishings data. It Una serie di prove di pesca con sistemi di automazione per palangari di fondo furono svolte a piu riprese nel corso del triennio 1991â€“93 in limitati settori dellâ€™Adriatico meridionale e dello Ionio NE al fine di valutare la funzionalita di questo tipo di attrezzatura ed i rendimenti ottenibili. Gran parte dei risultati esposti nel presente lavoro si riferiscono pero al periodo fine giugno â€“ fine settembre 1993, poiche solo in questo lasso di tempo fu possibile effettuare prove di pesca in maniera sufficientemente continuativa.I dati ottenuti hanno evidenziato che sistemi dâ€™automazione del tipo di quelli da noi sperimentati sono in grado di innescare in maniera efficace una frazione allâ€™incirca pari al 70% - 90% degli ami offerti, in relazione alla minore o maggiore consistenza delle carni dei pesci utilizzati. Nella maggior parte delle cale le rese di pesca sono risultate comprese tra 5 e 10 individui e tra 3 e 7 kilogrammi di pesce per ogni centinaio di ami correttamente innescati. Questi rendimenti sono risultati nettamente inferiori a quelli registrati in due prove di pesca svolte con un palangaro di tipo commerciale in una delle nostre aree di studio. I rendimenti rilevati nel corso delle nostre prove sperimentali sono stati tuttavia ritenuti economicamente validi, in considerazione dellâ€™elevato numero di ami che equipaggi addestrati dovrebbero essere in grado di calare giornalmente con sistemi dâ€™automazione del tipo di quelli in esame.In termini numerici le catture ottenute con palangari sperimentali sono risultate composte prevalentemente da Scorpenidi, gronchi, naselli e Selaci.In base alla composizione delle catture sono stati individuati alcuni ""clusters"" di specie tra loro piu frequentemente associate.",2002,

High-Dimensional Crowdsourced Data Distribution Estimation with Local Privacy,"High-dimensional crowdsourced data collected from a large number of users may produc3 rich knowledge for our society but also bring unprecedented privacy threats to participants. Recently differential privacy has been proposed as an effective means to mitigate privacy concerns. However, existing work on differential privacy suffers from the ""curse of high-dimensionality"" (data with multiple attributes) and high scalability (data with large scale records). Moreover, traditional methods of differential privacy were achieved via aggregation results, which cannot guarantee local privacy for distributed users in crowdsourced systems. To deal with these issues, in this paper we propose a novel scheme that can efficiently estimate multivariate joint distribution for high-dimensional data with local privacy. On the client side, we employ randomized response techniques to locally transform data from distributed users into privacy-preserving bit strings, which can prevent potential inside privacy attacks in crowdsourced systems. On the server side, the crowdsourced bit strings are aggregated for multivariate distribution estimation. Specifically, we first propose a multivariate version of the expectation maximization (EM) based algorithm to estimate the joint distribution of high dimensional data. To speed up the performance, unlike the EM-based method that needs to scan each user's bit string, we propose to use Lasso regression to obtain the distribution estimation from the aggregation information only once, which can significantly reduce the computation time for multivariate distribution estimation. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the efficiency of our multivariate distribution estimation scheme over existing estimation schemes.",2016,2016 IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (CIT)
Forest-attacking Invasive Species and Infant Health: Evidence From the Invasive Emerald Ash Borer,"Trees provide many ecosystem services. Widespread tree loss, therefore, would lead to degradations in environmental quality, which might have spillover effects on human health. For the first time, the infant health externalities of tree loss caused by an invasive species are investigated. We exploit a quasi-experimental setting where millions of ash trees have been destroyed in the US due to the invasive emerald ash borer (EAB). Since EAB spread is quasi-random due to flight and weather, and since ash tree loss due to EAB is extensive, our research design can eliminate many environmental confounders of concern. We use rich, mother-level natality data covering the near-universe of US births over 1999â€“2015. Difference-in-differences results suggest that along the intensive margin, birth weight and gestation are lower by 12.19 g and 0.024 weeks, respectively, after EAB detection in the mother's county of residence. Along the extensive margin, the probability that a mother has a low birth weight baby increases by 0.2%, equivalent to an increase of 16.2 per 100,000 live annual births. Results are robust to using the synthetic control method and the Lasso method. An internal validity test shows that findings are not due to the changing composition of mothers after EAB.",2018,Ecological Economics
Flexible parallel algorithms for big data optimization,"We propose a decomposition framework for the parallel optimization of the sum of a differentiable function and a (block) separable nonsmooth, convex one.

"On the parasitic organisms in a krill,Euphausia similis, from Suruga Bay","A considerable number ofEuphausia similisG. O. Sars were found to be infected with a parasite in the samples collected in the summer of 1969 in Suruga Bay. The same species was also parasitized by an ellobiopsid,Thalassomyces fagei (Boschma), but it was rare in occurrence. The former parasite is slightly oval in shape with the longer diameter ranging between 1.0 and 1.5 mm, average diameter 1.35 mm. It infests cardiac region, rarely gastric region, of the host. It has been preliminarily identified by Drs.T. Oshima andT. Shimazu of the Shinshu University as the progenetic metacercaria of a trematode species very closely related toPseudopecoelus japonicus; its adult was originally reported to infest several bathypelagic fishes and the encysted stage was also found in jack mackerel from Suruga Bay byYamaguti (1938). The occurrence of the metacercaria inE. similis from the area may be new to science, althoughG. O. Sars (1885) has reported the immature forms ofDistomum filiferumG. O. Sars inNematoscelis megalopsG. O. Sars andThysanoessa gregariaG. O. Sars and the crustaceans of wide variety have been proved to serve as the second intermediate host of various trematodes. The euphausiids infected with the metacercaria were concentrated in the innermost part of the bay. This might suggest the presence of the euphausiid population which is confined to the geographical area for some period. The metacercaria may be used as a â€œbiological tagâ€ to trace the migratory range of the host when the life history of the parasite is elucidated. The finding ofT. fagei in the area may be the first record of occurrence of the species in the western North Pacific, andE. similis is now recorded as the fourteenth known host euphausiid of the ellobiopsid.",1970,Journal of Oceanography
Flexible Clustering with a Sparse Mixture of Generalized Hyperbolic Distributions,"Robust clustering of high-dimensional data is an important topic because, in many practical situations, real data sets are heavy-tailed and/or asymmetric. Moreover, traditional model-based clustering often fails for high dimensional data due to the number of free covariance parameters. A parametrization of the component scale matrices for the mixture of generalized hyperbolic distributions is proposed by including a penalty term in the likelihood constraining the parameters resulting in a flexible model for high dimensional data and a meaningful interpretation. An analytically feasible EM algorithm is developed by placing a gamma-Lasso penalty constraining the concentration matrix. The proposed methodology is investigated through simulation studies and two real data sets.",2019,arXiv: Methodology
Discriminating between positional and non-positional obstructive sleep apnea using some clinical characteristics,"PurposeThe primary objective of this paper was to identify significant factors associated with positional Obstructive Sleep Apnea (POSA) and to provide a clinical tool for discriminating non positional from POSA. Secondary objectives were about estimating the prevalence of POSA, comparing the polysomnographic variables across POSA and non-POSA patients.MethodsThis was a cross sectional study on 278 patients who completed an overnight sleep study for OSA assessment. Patients were aged over 18Â years, without central sleep apnea or narcolepsy and slept no less than 20Â min in a non-supine position. POSA was defined as a total apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) â‰¥5 and a ratio supine AHI/non-supine AHI â‰¥2. The binary logistic regression was used for modeling the likelihood for OSA patient to be positional, and the LASSO method was used for selecting the optimal set of clinical characteristics associated with POSA.ResultsOverall, 53% of patients had POSA. These patients were younger (pÂ =Â 0.005), had lower BMI (pÂ <Â 0.0001), lower prevalence of hypertension (pÂ =Â 0.006), lower Berlin (pÂ =Â 0.01), and lower STOP (pÂ =Â 0.001) scores compared to non-POSA patients. Neck and waist circumference were higher in non-POSA (pÂ =Â 0.005, pÂ =Â 0.009, respectively) patients. Age, BMI, DBP, Mallampati, and Berlin scores were found to be the best clinical characteristics associated with POSA with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.71 (95% CI [0.63, 0.78]).ConclusionsHalf of patients referred for the sleep study had POSA. Age, BMI, DBP, Mallampati, and Berlin scores, put together, were shown to act as good clinical characteristics to discriminate between POSA and non-POSA patients.",2017,Sleep and Breathing
Consensus Machine Learning for Gene Target Selection in Pediatric AML Risk,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a cancer of hematopoietic systems that poses high population burden, especially among pediatric populations. AML presents with high molecular heterogeneity, complicating patient risk stratification and treatment planning. While molecular and cytogenetic subtypes of AML are well described, significance of subtype-specific gene expression patterns is poorly understood and effective modeling of these patterns with individual algorithms is challenging. Using a novel consensus machine learning approach, we analyzed public RNA-seq and clinical data from pediatric AML patients (N = 137 patients) enrolled in the TARGET project. We used a binary risk classifier (Low vs. Not-Low Risk) to study risk-specific expression patterns in pediatric AML. We applied the following workflow to identify important gene targets from RNA-seq data: (1) Reduce data dimensionality by identification of differentially expressed genes for AML risk (N = 1984 loci); (2) Optimize algorithm hyperparameters for each of 4 algorithm types (lasso, XGBoost, random forest, and SVM); (3) Study ablation test results for penalized methods (lasso and XGBoost); (4) Bootstrap Boruta permutations with a novel consensus importance metric. We observed recurrently selected features across hyperparameter optimizations, ablation tests, and Boruta permutation bootstrap iterations, including HOXA9 and putative cofactors including MEIS1. Consensus feature selection from Boruta bootstraps identified a larger gene set than single penalized algorithm runs (lasso or XGBoost), while also including correlated and predictive genes from ablation tests. We present a consensus machine learning approach to identify gene targets of likely importance for pediatric AML risk. The approach identified a moderately sized set of recurrent important genes from across 4 algorithm types, including genes identified across ablation tests with penalized algorithms (HOXA9 and MEIS1). Our approach mitigates exclusion biases of penalized algorithms (lasso and XGBoost) while obviating arbitrary importance cutoffs for other types (SVM and random forest). This approach is readily generalizable for research of other heterogeneous diseases, single-assay experiments, and high-dimensional data.

In the first place, he says, that in Mr. Lassone's experiment the effervescence proceeded not from any fixed air in the alkali, but from the further action of the acid on the zinc from which inflammable air was disengaged. But this could not have happened; for, first, the zinc, instead of being further acted on by the acid, was precipitated according to Mr. Lassone's own account (p.8.); and, secondly, the acid was only added by degrees, and undoubtedly would unite to the alkali preferably to the zinc; therefore it was from the alkali, and not from the zinc, that the effervescence arose.",1784,Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London
Application of penalized linear regression methods to the selection of environmental enteropathy biomarkers,"BackgroundEnvironmental Enteropathy (EE) is a subclinical condition caused by constant fecal-oral contamination and resulting in blunting of intestinal villi and intestinal inflammation. Of primary interest in the clinical research is to evaluate the association between non-invasive EE biomarkers and malnutrition in a cohort of Bangladeshi children. The challenges are that the number of biomarkers/covariates is relatively large, and some of them are highly correlated.MethodsMany variable selection methods are available in the literature, but which are most appropriate for EE biomarker selection remains unclear. In this study, different variable selection approaches were applied and the performance of these methods was assessed numerically through simulation studies, assuming the correlations among covariates were similar to those in the Bangladesh cohort. The suggested methods from simulations were applied to the Bangladesh cohort to select the most relevant biomarkers for the growth response, and bootstrapping methods were used to evaluate the consistency of selection results.ResultsThrough simulation studies, SCAD (Smoothly Clipped Absolute Deviation), Adaptive LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) and MCP (Minimax Concave Penalty) are the suggested variable selection methods, compared to traditional stepwise regression method. In the Bangladesh data, predictors such as mother weight, height-for-age z-score (HAZ) at week 18, and inflammation markers (Myeloperoxidase (MPO) at week 12 and soluable CD14 at week 18) are informative biomarkers associated with childrenâ€™s growth.ConclusionsPenalized linear regression methods are plausible alternatives to traditional variable selection methods, and the suggested methods are applicable to other biomedical studies. The selected early-stage biomarkers offer a potential explanation for the burden of malnutrition problems in low-income countries, allow early identification of infants at risk, and suggest pathways for intervention.Trial registrationThis study was retrospectively registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01375647, on June 3, 2011.",2017,Biomarker Research
Working for Change: Reflections on the Issue of Sustainability and Social Change,"Reading George Glassonâ€™s paper, I was transported back to the days when I used to work in a science education reform effort in India. This effort, known as the Hoshangabad Science Teaching Program (HSTP), developed, sustained, and disseminated an innovative inquiry-oriented, place-based framework of science teaching at the middle-school level. It was a collaborative effort that brought people on the ground â€“ the teachers, students, and activists â€“ on a common platform with educators and scientists in universities and research centers â€“ quite like the effort so well-documented by George Glasson. And just like what George Glasson and his intrepid colleagues have initiated in Malawi, HSTP too started small, though in 16 schools and not one, and not recently but way back in 1972. By 2002, the program had grown to cover about 1000 middle schools in Hoshangabad, and 14 other districts of the central state of Madhya Pradesh in India. However, as often happens with reform efforts in education, the program was unceremoniously shut down in 2002, and the schools that had been successfully teaching science through an inquiry and place-based curriculum for decades quietly went back to teaching Â­science the traditional way. Now when I look back at this unique effort in the history of education in India, I find that HSTP was largely successful in developing an alternative way to teach and learn science. However, even after a long run of 30 years, the programâ€™s accomplishments in terms of its ability to sustain itself and influence the dominant paradigm in science education were comparatively Â­somewhat muted.",2010,
Dual Lasso Selector,"We consider the problem of model selection and estimation in sparse high dimensional linear regression models with strongly correlated variables. First, we study the theoretical properties of the dual Lasso solution, and we show that joint consideration of the Lasso primal and its dual solutions are useful for selecting correlated active variables. Second, we argue that correlations among active predictors are not problematic, and we derive a new weaker condition on the design matrix, called Pseudo Irrepresentable Condition (PIC). Third, we present a new variable selection procedure, Dual Lasso Selector, and we prove that the PIC is a necessary and sufficient condition for consistent variable selection for the proposed method. Finally, by combining the dual Lasso selector further with the Ridge estimation even better prediction performance is achieved. We call the combination (DLSelect+Ridge), it can be viewed as a new combined approach for inference in high-dimensional regression models with correlated variables. We illustrate DLSelect+Ridge method and compare it with popular existing methods in terms of variable selection, prediction accuracy, estimation accuracy and computation speed by considering various simulated and real data examples.",2017,arXiv: Applications

A subspace-accelerated split Bregman method for sparse data recovery with joint l1-type regularizers,"We propose a subspace-accelerated Bregman method for the linearly constrained minimization of functions of the form $E(\mathbf{u}) = f(\mathbf{u})+\tau_1 \|\mathbf{u}\|_1 + \tau_2 \|D\,\mathbf{u}\|_1$, where $f$ is a smooth convex function and $D$ represents a linear operator, e.g. a finite difference operator, as in anisotropic Total Variation and fused-lasso regularizations. Problems of this type arise in a wide variety of applications, including portfolio optimization and learning of predictive models from fMRI data. The use of $\|D\,\mathbf{u}\|_1$ is aimed at encouraging structured sparsity in the solution. The subspaces where the acceleration is performed are selected so that the restriction of the objective function is a smooth function in a neighborhood of the current iterate. Numerical experiments on multi-period portfolio selection problems using real datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed method.",2019,ArXiv
Temporal Gut Microbial Changes Predict Recurrent Clostridium difficile in Patients with and without Ulcerative Colitis,"Background Ulcerative colitis (UC) carries an increased risk of primary and recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (rCDI) and CDI is associated with UC flares. We hypothesized that specific fecal microbial changes associate with UC flare and rCDI. Methods We conducted a prospective observational cohort study of 57 patients with UC and CDI, CDI only, and UC flare only. Stool samples were collected at baseline, at the end of antibiotic therapy, and after reconstitution for 16S rRNA sequencing. The primary outcomes were recurrent UC flare and rCDI. Logistic regression and Lasso models were constructed for analysis. Results There were 21 (45.7%) patients with rCDI, while 11 (34.4%) developed UC flare. Patients with rCDI demonstrated significant inter-individual (P=.008) and intra-individual differences (P=.004 relative to baseline samples) in community structure by Jensen-Shannon distance (JSD) compared with non-rCDI. Two cross-validated models identified by Lasso regression predicted risk of rCDI: a baseline model with female gender, hospitalization for UC in the past year, increased Ruminococcaceae and Verrucomicrobia, and decreased Eubacteriaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and Veillonellaceae (AuROC=0.94); and a model 14 days after completion of antibiotics with female gender, increased Shannon diversity, Ruminococcaceae and Enterobacteriaceae, and decreased community richness and Faecalibacterium (AuROC=0.9). Adding JSD between baseline and post-treatment samples to the latter model improved fit (AuROC=0.94). A baseline model including UC hospitalization in the past year and increased Bacteroidetes showed good fit characteristics for predicting increased risk of UC flare (AuROC=0.88). Conclusion Fecal microbial features at baseline and following therapy predict rCDI risk in patients with and without UC. These results may help risk stratify patients to guide management.",2019,bioRxiv
"[Efficacy and tolerability of antiretroviral therapy containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-emtricitabine-efavirenz in treatment-naive patients infected with HIV-1 in Bobo Dioulasso (Burkina Faso, 2009-2011)].","The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and the clinical tolerance of a combination containing TDF/FTC/EFV in the treatment of HIV infection. This was a retrospective and descriptive study which included 196 adults infected by HIV-1 and treated by a combination containing TDF/FTC/EFV during 29 months in the daily hospital of Bobo Dioulasso. The median duration of follow-up was 7 months IQR [5-14 month]. The median age was 37 years IQR [31-45].With the initiation of treatment ARV, the median of the index of body mass was of 19 IQR [17-22]. The median of the lymphocytes TCD4 was 201/Î¼l IQR [74-298/Î¼l]. During the follow-up, we reported 25 deaths (12.8%). HIV-1 RNA plasma viral load was undetectable in 91.9% of the patients (124/135) at six months of treatment. The majority of the adverse effects of the treatment were of a neurosensory nature (40.5%). The TDF/FTC/EFV combination showed a good effectiveness in the treatment of the infection with HIV-1 in the first intention just as a good clinical tolerance.",2013,Bulletin de la Societe de pathologie exotique
A comparison of techniques and technologies for SSVEP classification,"This paper presents the evaluation of seven techniques of feature extraction (PSD, F-Test, EMD, MCE, CCA, LASSO and MSI) for gaze-target detections in a SSVEP-based BCI. Two type of technologies for visual stimulation were used (LCD and LEDs). Five differents windows lengths (1, 2, 4, 5 and 10 s) were used and seven volunteers participated in this study. The highest accuracy obtained in all cases was 93.57% using LEDs and the highest ITR was 36.90 bits/min for LCD. The technique based on MSI shows the highest success rate in both cases (LCD or LED) and is even more noticeable when the window size is increased.",2014,5th ISSNIP-IEEE Biosignals and Biorobotics Conference (2014): Biosignals and Robotics for Better and Safer Living (BRC)
Evaluer lâ€™anÃ©mie maternelle sÃ©vÃ¨re et ses consÃ©quences : la valeur dâ€™un simple examen de la coloration des conjonctives palpÃ©brales,"Lâ€™objectif de ce travail etait dâ€™evaluer la relation entre le niveau dâ€™hemoglobine (Hb) et la pÃ¢leur des conjonctives palpebrales a lâ€™accouchement et le risque de consequences graves chez lâ€™enfant a type de faible poids de naissance, dâ€™accouchement premature et de deces perinatal. Nous avons mene une etude prospective du 12 janvier au 6 mars 1995 chez des femmes admises en travail dans la maternite du Centre hospitalier national Souro Sanou de Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina Faso). Un examen clinique relevant la pÃ¢leur des conjonctives palpebrales a ete realise chez toutes les femmes et un dosage de lâ€™Hb avec un hemoglobinometre portatif (HemoCueÂ® B-Haemoglobin System, Suede) a ete ensuite pratique. Les grossesses multiples ont ete exclues. Au total, 247 femmes ont ete incluses. Trois deces maternels ont ete enregistres, tous chez des femmes anemiees dont deux presentaient une anemie severe. Trois endometrites du post-partum ont ete observees. La prevalence de lâ€™anemie a lâ€™accouchement (Hb < 11 g/dl) sâ€™elevait a 66,6 % (intervalle de confiance a 95 % : 60,5-72,6). Lâ€™anemie severe et la pÃ¢leur des conjonctives palpebrales chez la mere (Hb < 7 g/dl) etaient significativement associees a la prematurite et au deces perinatal mais non au faible poids de naissance. La sensibilite et la specificite de la pÃ¢leur conjonctivale pour la detection de lâ€™anemie severe etaient respectivement de 87 % et de 88 %. Lâ€™anemie moderee et legere (Hb = 7 g/dl) nâ€™etait associee a aucun resultat defavorable de la grossesse. Ces resultats montrent que les consequences graves de lâ€™anemie chez la mere et chez lâ€™enfant sont liees a une concentration basse de lâ€™Hb. Ce niveau bas dâ€™Hb est accessible a un depistage clinique et a une prise en charge au moindre cout dans les dispensaires prenatals.",1999,
