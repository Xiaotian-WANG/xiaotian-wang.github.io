An Empirical-Bayes Approach to Recovering Linearly Constrained Non-Negative Sparse Signals,"We propose two novel approaches for the recovery of an (approximately) sparse signal from noisy linear measurements in the case that the signal is a priori known to be non-negative and obey given linear equality constraints, such as a simplex signal. This problem arises in, e.g., hyperspectral imaging, portfolio optimization, density estimation, and certain cases of compressive imaging. Our first approach solves a linearly constrained non-negative version of LASSO using the max-sum version of the generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) algorithm, where we consider both quadratic and absolute loss, and where we propose a novel approach to tuning the LASSO regularization parameter via the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. Our second approach is based on the sum-product version of the GAMP algorithm, where we propose the use of a Bernoulli non-negative Gaussian-mixture signal prior and a Laplacian likelihood and propose an EM-based approach to learning the underlying statistical parameters. In both approaches, the linear equality constraints are enforced by augmenting GAMP's generalized-linear observation model with noiseless pseudo-measurements. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our proposed approaches.",2014,IEEE Trans. Signal Process.
Sparse Extended Redundancy Analysis: Variable Selection via the Exclusive LASSO.,"Extended Redundancy Analysis is a statistical tool for exploring the directional relationships of multiple sets of exogenous variables on a set of endogenous variables. This approach posits that the endogenous and exogenous variables are related via latent components, each of which is extracted from a set of exogenous variables, that account for the maximum variation of the endogenous variables. However, it is often difficult to distinguish between the true variables that form the latent components and the false variables that do not, especially when the association between the true variables and the exogenous set is weak. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Sparse Extended Redundancy Analysis via the Exclusive LASSO that performs variable selection while maintaining model specification. We validate the performance of the proposed approach in a simulation study. Finally, the empirical utility of this approach is demonstrated through two examples-one on a study of youth academic achievement and the other on a text analysis of newspaper data.",2019,Multivariate behavioral research
"Peloids and pelotherapy: Historical evolution, classification and glossary","Abstract Targets, concepts, principles, methods, historical evolution, interactions with other sciences, systems, and implications on society are common fundamentals to any science or scientific field. With regard to concepts they can be expressed differently by people from different educational backgrounds and experiences, but preserving the fundamental ideas. Concepts can also evolve over times. This paper shows the changes undergone by the concept of peloid since the creation of this term and meaning in 1933, and the arguments that justified those changes. Also, the systems or classifications of peloids have evolved since the first classification proposed in 1937. This paper shows the classifications which have been proposed since then and the fundamentals on which they were based upon. Also a new, short and concise definition and classification of peloids are proposed. Relevant inconsistencies are found in the scientific literature regarding both nomenclature and definition of terms used in health resort medicine or spa therapy, skin care, balneology, balneotherapy, hydrotherapy, mud therapy, pelotherapy, thalassotherapy, climatology, and climatotherapy. Even the international general acceptance of these methods and terms is not fully recognized. A glossary with the terms and corresponding technical definitions does not exist. A glossary in English, the idiom worldwide used for science communication, prepared by an ad hoc Working Group constituted by the authors of the present paper is herewith proposed.",2013,Applied Clay Science

Relationship between Stress Ethylene Production Induced by Gamma Irradiation and Ripening of Cherry Tomatoes DÃ©partement de Physiologic,"Changes in ACC metabolism induced by gamma irradiation have been studied during ripening of cherry tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum L. CV. Sweet 100) treated at the mature-green stage. Irradiation caused a sharp and transient dose-dependent increase in ethylene production during the first 24 hours that was associated with an increase in ACC synthase activity. The activity of ethylene-forming enzyme (EFE) was also stimulated but was never limiting. Nine days following irradiation, ACC metabolism was more active in irradiated fruits, with ACC being mainly directed to ethylene [80% at 3 kilogray (kGy; 1 Gray = 100 Rad = 1 JÂ·kg-)] rather than to malonyl ACC (MACC). As a consequence, fruit ripening was accelerated. For doses <1 kGy, the time required for 50% of the fruits to reach breaker stage (the onset of climacteric ethylene production) was inversely correlated with radiation dose and the amount of stress ethylene produced during the first 24 hours. At doses >1 kGy, in spite of a continuous stimulation of stress ethylene production, no additional acceleration of ripening occurred. At 3to 5-kGv doses. fruit ripening was impaired transiently with a fast subsequent recovery. As a result a significant synchronization of fruit . . ,.. â€”-ripening (presumed to be caused by enhanced ethylene production) was observed. Chemical, names used: l-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC). Climacteric fruits submitted to gamma irradiation exhibit either a delay of ripening (Akamine and Moy, 1983; Urbain; 1986; Thomas, 1988) or an advance (Maxie et al.,. 1966), depending on the fruit species and the developmental stage at which the treatment is applied. In the specific case of tomatoes, irradiation generally delays ripening when the treatment is applied at the preclimacteric stage (Abdel-Kader et al., 1968; Lee et al., 1968; Thomas, 1988), while it can cause an advance when it is applied earlier (Lee et al., 1968). These differential responses may be ascribed to the dual effects of gamma rays: i) impairment of cellular functions and therefore of ripening, with possible recovery (McGlasson and Lee, 1971; Romani et al., 1968); and ii) stimulation of the synthesis of ethylene (Abdel-Kader et al., 1968), which is known to stimulate fruit ripening (Brady, 1987; McGlasson, 1985). In a previous study, we have demonstrated that gamma irradiation strongly and rapidly activated ACC synthesis at the post-transcriptional level, in breaker cherry tomatoes (Larrigaudiere et al., 1990). The present work was undertaken to determine whether the stress ethylene being produced immediately after the treatment could play a role in the onset and advancement of ripening of preclimacteric fruits. The effects of various doses of gamma irradiation on the stimulation of ACC metabolism (ethylene production, ACC and MACC levels, ACC synthase, and EFE activities) on mature-green cherry tomatoes were investigated on a shortand long-term basis. or publication 30 Nov. 1990.

Materials and Methods Plant material and irradiation treatment. â€˜Sweet 101â€™ cherry tomato plants (Fl from INRA, France) were grown in a greenhouse (25/18C, day/night) and fruits were harvested at the mature-green stage. They were then selected according to their chromametric value and their ethylene production according to Guclu et al. (1989) with the modifications described below. Fruit color was determined on the calycinal face of the fruit, using a chromameter (CR 200, Minolta, Japan), by measurement of the â€˜aâ€™ value in the L, a, b system. Previous analysis and correlations with ethylene production, taken as a marker of ripening, have shown that the â€˜aâ€™ value was sufficient to characterize maturity stages; a = â€“ 10, immature; a = 8.0, mature-green; â€“ 6.0 < a < â€“2, breaker; a = 14.0, orange stage. Preclimacteric tomato fruits were selected at a fully mature-green stage (a = â€“ 8.0 Â± 0.5). Irradiation treatment was carried out with a 60Co irradiator [Oris, France 30000 Ci (1 Ci = 37 GBq]). All experiments were conducted at 20C at a dose rate of 110 GyÂ·min -1. Irradiated and control fruits were held in a controlled-temperature room at 20C at 80â€™% relative humidity. Determination of the onset of ripening. An individual fruit was considered as having reached the onset of ripening, or breaker stage, when the â€˜aâ€™ was higher than â€“ 6 and the ethylene production rate >0.15 nmoÂ·g -lÂ· .h -1. The days to 50% ripening corresponded to the time required for half of the fruits (30 fruits total) to reach the breaker stage. Ethylene production. Each of the 30 fruits was placed in a 100-ml flask that was sealed with a serum cap. A l-ml gas sample was withdrawn after 1 h incubation and analyzed by a gas chromatography using an activated alumina column and a flame ionization detector. Determination of ACC and MACC.

The ACC analysis was carried out on six fruits by oxidative conversion into ethylene (Lizada and Yang, 1979). For the determination of MACC, the sample was first passed through a Dowex 50-W (H+, 100-200 mesh) column to remove free ACC. MACC in the eluate was then hydrolyzed into ACC and quantified (Liu et al., 1985b). Enzyme extractions and assays. ACC synthase extraction and activity determination were carried out according to Acaster and Kende (1983) with slight modifications as described by Larrigaudiere et al. (1990). EFE activity was determined in the whole fruit by measuring the conversion of vacuum-infiltrated ACC to ethylene in the presence of cycloheximide (Larrigaudiere et al., 1990). All enzyme activities were determined on three separate f r u i t s .",1997,

The ternary complex factor protein ELK1 is an independent prognosticator of disease recurrence in prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND
Both hormone-sensitive and castration- and enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancers (PCa) depend on the ternary complex factor (TCF) protein ELK1 to serve as a tethering protein for the androgen receptor (AR) to activate a critical set of growth genes. The two sites in ELK1 required for AR binding are conserved in other members of the TCF subfamily, ELK3 and ELK4. Here we examine the potential utility of the three proteins as prognosticators of disease recurrence in PCa.


METHODS
Transcriptional activity assays; Retrospective analysis of PCa recurrence using data on 501 patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database; Unpaired Wilcoxon rank-sum test and multiple comparison correction using the Holm's method; Spearman's correlations; Kaplan-Meier methods; Univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses; LASSO-based penalized Cox regression models; Time-dependent area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.


RESULTS
ELK4 but not ELK3 was coactivated by AR similar to ELK1. Tumor expression of neither ELK3 nor ELK4 was associated with disease-free survival (DFS). ELK1 was associated with higher clinical T-stage, pathology T-stage, Gleason score, prognostic grade, and positive lymph node status. ELK1 was a negative prognosticator of DFS, independent of ELK3, ELK4, clinical T-stage, pathology T-stage, prognostic grade, lymph node status, age, and race. Inclusion of ELK1 increased the abilities of the Oncotype DX and Prolaris gene panels to predict disease recurrence, correctly predicting disease recurrence in a unique subset of patients.


CONCLUSIONS
ELK1 is a strong, independent prognosticator of disease recurrence in PCa, underscoring its unique role in PCa growth. Inclusion of ELK1 may enhance the utility of currently used prognosticators for clinical decision making in prostate cancer.",2019,The Prostate

Quantitative metabolomics reveals HFmrEF as a distinct phenotype of heart failure,"Abstract Background Heart Failure with middle-range ejection fraction (HFmrEF) has been recently acknowledged as a separate phenotype but metabolomics evaluation of this subtype remains largely untouched. Methods A quantitative metabolomics study on amino acids and acylcarnitines was performed to characterize different states of HF in 628 participants. Both multivariate orthogonal partial least squares- discriminant analysis and univariate Mann-Whitney U test were used to explore reliable metabolic profiles associated with different HF states. The resulting metabolites were further refined for obtaining diagnostic metabolite score (DMS) with ordinal logistic regression. Lasso-penalized regression was applied to produce a survival-associated prognostic metabolite score (PMS). The Cox proportional hazards model, Kaplan-Meier curve, and time-dependent ROC were used for a comprehensive assessment of prognostic value using PMS versus traditional clinical biomarkers. Results The optimized models identified a panel of fifteen differential metabolites that are shared across different HF states while some metabolites are associated with a specific state. PMS consisting of nine metabolites demonstrated an appreciably better prognostic value (hazard ratio, HR 1.62 [1.25-2.1] 95% CI, p Conclusions Targeted metabolomics has provided a novel understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying HF. Both DMS and PMS clearly demonstrated HFmrEF as a distinct phenotype between a mild HFpEF state and a severe HFrEF state. PMS exhibited superior prognostic value than Ln(NT-proBNP). Further investigation is needed with independent large-scale validation.",2020,Canadian Journal of Cardiology
A Risk Model for Prediction of 1-Year Mortality in Patients Undergoing MitraClip Implantation.,"There is a lack of specific tools for risk stratification in patients who undergo MitraClip implantation. We aimed at combining preprocedural variables with prognostic impact into a specific risk model for the prediction of 1-year mortality in patients undergoing MitraClip implantation. A total of 311 consecutive patients who underwent MitraClip implantation were included. A lasso-penalized Cox-proportional hazard regression model was used to identify independent predictors of 1-year all-cause mortality. A nomogram (GRASP [Getting Reduction of mitrAl inSufficiency by Percutaneous clip implantation] nomogram) was obtained from the Cox model. Validation was performed using internal bootstrap resampling. Forty-two deaths occurred at 1-year follow-up. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of 1-year survival was 0.845 (95% confidence interval, 0.802 to 0.895). Four independent predictors of mortality (mean arterial blood pressure, hemoglobin natural log-transformed pro-brain natriuretic peptide levels, New York Heart Association class IV at presentation) were identified. At internal bootstrap resampling validation, the GRASP nomogram had good discrimination (area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.78, Somers' Dxy statistic of 0.53) and calibration (le Cessie-van Houwelingen-Copas-Hosmer p value of 0.780). Conversely, the discriminative ability of the EuroSCORE II (the European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation II) and the STS-PROM (the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality score) was fairly modest with area under the curve values of 0.61 and 0.55, respectively. A treatment-specific risk model in patients who undergo MitraClip implantation may be useful for the stratification of mortality at 1Â year. Further studies are needed to provide external validation and support the generalizability ofÂ the GRASP nomogram.",2017,The American journal of cardiology

Optimal Portfolio Selection using Regularization,"The mean-variance principle of Markowitz (1952) for portfolio selection gives disappointing results once the mean and variance are replaced by their sample counterparts. The problem is ampliâ€¦ed when the number of assets is large and the sample covariance is singular or nearly singular. In this paper, we investigate four regularization techniques to stabilize the inverse of the covariance matrix: the ridge, spectral cut-oÂ¤, Landweber-Fridman and LARS Lasso. These four methods involve a tuning parameter that needs to be selected. The main contribution is to derive a data-driven method for selecting the tuning parameter in an optimal way, i.e. in order to minimize the expected loss in utility of a mean-variance investor. The cross-validation type criterion takes a similar form for the four regularization methods. The resulting regularized rules are compared to the sample-based meanvariance portfolio and the naive 1/N strategy in terms of in-sample and out-ofsample Sharpe ratio and expected loss in utility. The main â€¦nding is that a regularization to covariance matrix drastically improves the performance of meanvariance problem and outperforms the naive portfolio especially in ill-posed cases, as demonstrated through extensive simulations and empirical study.",2010,
Hyperspectral image spectral denoising using pure and wavelet with sparse restoration,"Hyper Spectral Image (HSI) denoising are usually classified as signal dependent and signal independent methods of denoising. In an HSI data, both signal dependent and signal independent noises co-exist and it is said as a mixed noise condition. The proposed method in this paper denoises an HSI data, in which a signal dependent Poisson noise is degraded by a signal independent AWGN. This method uses lasso regression along with Poisson based Stein Unbaised Risk Estimation to remove the Poisson degraded by AWGN. The regularization parameter is updated for every band of data and it uses wavelet for image denoising. This method is evaluated in terms SNR and IEF and compared with the other existing methods of denoising.",2015,2015 International Conference on Communications and Signal Processing (ICCSP)
Genome-wide interaction analysis of quantitative traits in outbred mice.,"With a large number of quantitative trait loci being identified in genome-wide association studies, researchers have become more interested in detecting interactions among genes or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In this research, we carried out a two-stage model selection procedure to detect interacting gene pairs or SNP pairs associated with four important traits of outbred mice, including glucose, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, diastolic blood pressure and triglyceride. In the first stage, a variance heterogeneity test was used to screen for candidate SNPs. In the second stage, the Lasso method and single pair analysis were used to select two-way interactions. Moreover, the shared Gene Ontology information about the selected interacting gene pairs was considered to study the interactions auxiliarily. Based on this method, we not only replicated the identification of important SNPs associated with each trait of outbred mice, but also found some SNP pairs and gene pairs with significant interaction effects on each trait. Simulation studies were also conducted to evaluate the performance of the two-stage method in different situations.",2015,Genetics research

Comparison of Cox Model Methods in A Low-dimensional Setting with Few Events,"Prognostic models based on survival data frequently make use of the Cox proportional hazards model. Developing reliable Cox models with few events relative to the number of predictors can be challenging, even in low-dimensional datasets, with a much larger number of observations than variables. In such a setting we examined the performance of methods used to estimate a Cox model, including (i) full model using all available predictors and estimated by standard techniques, (ii) backward elimination (BE), (iii) ridge regression, (iv) least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso), and (v) elastic net. Based on a prospective cohort of patients with manifest coronary artery disease (CAD), we performed a simulation study to compare the predictive accuracy, calibration, and discrimination of these approaches. Candidate predictors for incident cardiovascular events we used included clinical variables, biomarkers, and a selection of genetic variants associated with CAD. The penalized methods, i.e., ridge, lasso, and elastic net, showed a comparable performance, in terms of predictive accuracy, calibration, and discrimination, and outperformed BE and the full model. Excessive shrinkage was observed in some cases for the penalized methods, mostly on the simulation scenarios having the lowest ratio of a number of events to the number of variables. We conclude that in similar settings, these three penalized methods can be used interchangeably. The full model and backward elimination are not recommended in rare event scenarios.",2016,"Genomics, Proteomics & Bioinformatics"
Variable selection in the general linear model for censored data,"Variable selection is a popular topic in statistics today. However, for right censored data, only a few methods are available. The principle method assumes that the data comes from a Cox proportional hazards model. In 1997, Tibshirani proposed a variation of the LASSO method that minimizes the log partial likelihood subject to the sum of the absolute values of the parameters being bounded by a constant in the Cox proportional hazards model. Due to the nature of this constraint, it shrinks coefficients and produces some coefficients that are exactly zero. The resulting prediction error is smaller than that of subset selection methods. However, the proportional hazard assumption isnâ€™t always appropriate for real data. Therefore, we apply this method to the class of models (linear regression models) in which the response variable is right censored and the error is symmetric at zero, but is otherwise distribution free. The method also uses a sieve-likelihood to calculate a variation of the LASSO criterion and uses generalized cross-validation to choose the tuning parameter. Simulation shows that this method gives smaller prediction error than the method that depends on the proportional hazard assumption in some scenarios, especially for larger sample sizes. The performance of the proposed method is also examined via a data set from a study of the ganglioside content of primary brain tumors and a data set from a study of bone marrow transplants in Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia patients.",2007,
Compressed History Matching: Exploiting Transform-Domain Sparsity for Regularization ofÂ Nonlinear Dynamic Data Integration Problems,"In this paper, we present a new approach for estimating spatially-distributed reservoir properties from scattered nonlinear dynamic well measurements by promoting sparsity in an appropriate transform domain where the unknown properties are believed to have a sparse approximation. The method is inspired by recent advances in sparse signal reconstruction that is formalized under the celebrated compressed sensing paradigm. Here, we use a truncated low-frequency discrete cosine transform (DCT) is redundant to approximate the spatial parameters with a sparse set of coefficients that are identified and estimated using available observations while imposing sparsity on the solution. The intrinsic continuity in geological features lends itself to sparse representations using selected low frequency DCT basis elements. By recasting the inversion in the DCT domain, the problem is transformed into identification of significant basis elements and estimation of the values of their corresponding coefficients. To find these significant DCT coefficients, a relatively large number of DCT basis vectors (without any preferred orientation) are initially included in the approximation. Available measurements are combined with a sparsity-promoting penalty on the DCT coefficients to identify coefficients with significant contribution and eliminate the insignificant ones. Specifically, minimization of a least-squares objective function augmented by an l1-norm of DCT coefficients is used to implement this scheme. The sparsity regularization approach using the l1-norm minimization leads to a better-posed inverse problem that improves the non-uniqueness of the history matching solutions and promotes solutions that are, according to the prior belief, sparse in the transform domain. The approach is related to basis pursuit (BP) and least absolute selection and shrinkage operator (LASSO) methods, and it extends the application of compressed sensing to inverse modeling with nonlinear dynamic observations. While the method appears to be generally applicable for solving dynamic inverse problems involving spatially-distributed parameters with sparse representation in any linear complementary basis, in this paper its suitability is demonstrated using low frequency DCT basis and synthetic waterflooding experiments.",2010,Mathematical Geosciences
Distinguishing malignant from benign microscopic skin lesions using desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging.,"Detection of microscopic skin lesions presents a considerable challenge in diagnosing early-stage malignancies as well as in residual tumor interrogation after surgical intervention. In this study, we established the capability of desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging (DESI-MSI) to distinguish between micrometer-sized tumor aggregates of basal cell carcinoma (BCC), a common skin cancer, and normal human skin. We analyzed 86 human specimens collected during Mohs micrographic surgery for BCC to cross-examine spatial distributions of numerous lipids and metabolites in BCC aggregates versus adjacent skin. Statistical analysis using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operation (Lasso) was employed to categorize each 200-Âµm-diameter picture element (pixel) of investigated skin tissue map as BCC or normal. Lasso identified 24 molecular ion signals, which are significant for pixel classification. These ion signals included lipids observed at m/z 200-1,200 and Krebs cycle metabolites observed at m/z < 200. Based on these features, Lasso yielded an overall 94.1% diagnostic accuracy pixel by pixel of the skin map compared with histopathological evaluation. We suggest that DESI-MSI/Lasso analysis can be employed as a complementary technique for delineation of microscopic skin tumors.",2018,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
MO-FG-202-09: Virtual IMRT QA Using Machine Learning: A Multi-Institutional Validation.,"PURPOSE
To validate a machine learning approach to Virtual IMRT QA for accurately predicting gamma passing rates using different QA devices at different institutions.


METHODS
A Virtual IMRT QA was constructed using a machine learning algorithm based on 416 IMRT plans, in which QA measurements were performed using diode-array detectors and a 3%local/3mm with 10% threshold. An independent set of 139 IMRT measurements from a different institution, with QA data based on portal dosimetry using the same gamma index and 10% threshold, was used to further test the algorithm. Plans were characterized by 90 different complexity metrics. A weighted poison regression with Lasso regularization was trained to predict passing rates using the complexity metrics as input.


RESULTS
In addition to predicting passing rates with 3% accuracy for all composite plans using diode-array detectors, passing rates for portal dosimetry on per-beam basis were predicted with an error <3.5% for 120 IMRT measurements. The remaining measurements (19) had large areas of low CU, where portal dosimetry has larger disagreement with the calculated dose and, as such, large errors were expected. These beams need to be further modeled to correct the under-response in low dose regions. Important features selected by Lasso to predict gamma passing rates were: complete irradiated area outline (CIAO) area, jaw position, fraction of MLC leafs with gaps smaller than 20 mm or 5mm, fraction of area receiving less than 50% of the total CU, fraction of the area receiving dose from penumbra, weighted Average Irregularity Factor, duty cycle among others.


CONCLUSION
We have demonstrated that the Virtual IMRT QA can predict passing rates using different QA devices and across multiple institutions. Prediction of QA passing rates could have profound implications on the current IMRT process.",2016,Medical physics
Phraseology of disk herniation: an inevitable revision.,"0009-9260/$ e see front matter 2010 The Royal Co doi:10.1016/j.crad.2010.07.004 Disk herniation, the common term for the most important clinical features of degenerative disk disease, is composed by elements of both classic languages, that are disk [from diskos (Greek)1â„4 disc, plate, slice] and herniation [from hernia (Latin)1â„4 hernia, rupture]. The component herniation can be replaced by prolapse, which also goes back to Latin and which is only marginally modified in each of the many languages putting it to use (such as prolapso in Spanish, prolapsus in French, prolasso in Italian, and prolaps in German). In the appropriate clinical context, the term is unambiguous both for neurologists and neurosurgeons as well as for orthopaedists, radiologists, and general practitioners. The underlying Latin term is prolapsus, us, a masculine of the fourth declension. There exists also the feminine variant prolapsio in the Roman literature.1 The corresponding verb is prolabi.2 The Latin word prolapsus is a compound of two elements, the preposition pro (that is â€œat the front,â€ â€œup to the frontâ€) and the noun lapsus (that is â€œgliding,â€ â€œfallingâ€). Thus, prolapsus denotes a foreword motion. The term is hardly ever found in the ancient Roman literature. The Late Latin poet Rufius Festus Avienus (second half of the fourth century A.D.) used it in his Description of the Earth (Chapter 84) for telling of running water (prolapsus aquae). In the Medieval Latin literature, the phrase is neither documented in its original meaning nor as a scientific term. In order to refer to the fall out of deciduous teeth in children, the Romans made do with the simple word lapsus.3",2010,Clinical radiology

An Optimization Approach to Detect Differentially Methylated Regions from Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing Data,"Whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) is the current method of choice to obtain the methylation status of each single CpG dinucleotide in a genome. The typical analysis asks for regions that are differentially methylated (DMRs) between samples of two classes, such as different cell types. However, even with current low sequencing costs, many studies need to cope with few samples and medium coverage to stay within budget. We present a method to conservatively estimate the methylation difference between the two classes. Starting from a Bayesian paradigm, we formulate an optimization problem related to LASSO approaches. We present a dynamic programming approach to efficiently compute the optimal solution and its implementation diffmer. We discuss the dependency of the resulting DMRs on the free parameters of our approach and compare the results to those obtained by other DMR discovery tools (BSmooth and RADMeth). We showcase that our method discovers DMRs that are missed by the other tools.",2015,PeerJ
Precise Error Analysis of the $\ell_2$-LASSO,"A classical problem that arises in numerous signal processing applications asks for the reconstruction of an unknown, ksparse signal x0 âˆˆ R from underdetermined, noisy, linear measurements y = Ax0 + z âˆˆ R. One standard approach is to solve the following convex program xÌ‚ = arg minx â€–yâˆ’ Axâ€–2+Î»â€–xâ€–1, which is known as the `2-LASSO. We assume that the entries of the sensing matrix A and of the noise vector z are i.i.d Gaussian with variances 1/m and Ïƒ. In the large system limit when the problem dimensions grow to infinity, but in constant rates, we precisely characterize the limiting behavior of the normalized squared error â€–xÌ‚âˆ’ x0â€–2/Ïƒ. Our numerical illustrations validate our theoretical predictions.",2015,
Some Analysis of the Knockoff Filter and its Variants,"In many applications, we need to study a linear regression model that consists of a response variable and a large number of potential explanatory variables and determine which variables are truly associated with the response. In 2015, Barber and Candes introduced a new variable selection procedure called the knockoff filter to control the false discovery rate (FDR) and proved that this method achieves exact FDR control. In this paper, we provide some analysis of the knockoff filter and its variants. Based on our analysis, we propose a PCA prototype group selection filter that has exact group FDR control and several advantages over existing group selection methods for strongly correlated features. Another contribution is that we propose a new noise estimator that can be incorporated into the knockoff statistic from a penalized method without violating the exchangeability property. Our analysis also reveals that some knockoff statistics, including the Lasso path and the marginal correlation statistics, suffer from the alternating sign effect. To overcome this deficiency, we introduce the notion of a good statistic and propose several alternative statistics that take advantage of the good statistic property. Finally, we present a number of numerical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods and confirm our analysis.",2017,arXiv: Methodology
Classifying Partially Labeled Networked Data via Logistic Network Lasso,"We apply the network Lasso to classify partially labeled data points which are characterized by high-dimensional feature vectors. In order to learn an accurate classifier from limited amounts of labeled data, we borrow statistical strength, via an intrinsic network structure, across the dataset. The resulting logistic network Lasso amounts to a regularized empirical risk minimization problem using the total variation of a classifier as a regularizer. This minimization problem is a non-smooth convex optimization problem which we solve using a primal-dual splitting method. This method is appealing for big data applications as it can be implemented as a highly scalable message passing algorithm.",2019,ArXiv

Stable Gene Regulatory Network Modeling From Steady-State Data â€ ,"Gene regulatory networks represent an abstract mapping of gene regulations in living cells. They aim to capture dependencies among molecular entities such as transcription factors, proteins and metabolites. In most applications, the regulatory network structure is unknown, and has to be reverse engineered from experimental data consisting of expression levels of the genes usually measured as messenger RNA concentrations in microarray experiments. Steady-state gene expression data are obtained from measurements of the variations in expression activity following the application of small perturbations to equilibrium states in genetic perturbation experiments. In this paper, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator-vector autoregressive (LASSO-VAR) originally proposed for the analysis of economic time series data is adapted to include a stability constraint for the recovery of a sparse and stable regulatory network that describes data obtained from noisy perturbation experiments. The approach is applied to real experimental data obtained for the SOS pathway in Escherichia coli and the cell cycle pathway for yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Significant features of this method are the ability to recover networks without inputting prior knowledge of the network topology, and the ability to be efficiently applied to large scale networks due to the convex nature of the method.",2016,Bioengineering

Robust causal dependence mining in big data network and its application to traffic flow predictions,"Abstract In this paper, we focus on a special problem in transportation studies that concerns the so called â€œBig Dataâ€ challenge, which is: how to build concise yet accurate traffic flow prediction models based on the massive data collected by different sensors ? The size of the data, the hidden causal dependence and the complexity of traffic time series are some of the obstacles that affect making reliable forecast at a reasonable cost, both time-wise and computation-wise. To better prepare the data for traffic modeling, we introduce a multiple-step strategy to process the raw â€œBig Dataâ€ into compact time series that are better suited for regression and causality analysis. First, we use the Granger causality to define and determine the potential dependence among data, and produce a much condensed set of times series who are also highly dependent. Next, we deploy a decomposition algorithm to separate daily-similar trend and nonstationary bursts components from the traffic flow time series yielded by the Granger test. The decomposition results are then treated by two rounds of Lasso regression: the standard Lasso method is first used to quickly filter out most of the irrelevant data, followed by a robust Lasso method to further remove the disturbance caused by bursts components and recover the strongest dependence among the remaining data. Test results show that the proposed method significantly reduces the costs of building prediction models. Moreover, the obtained causal dependence graph reveals the relationship between the structure of road networks and the correlations among traffic time series. All these findings are useful for building better traffic flow prediction models.",2015,Transportation Research Part C-emerging Technologies
In silico analysis of mitochondrial proteins,"Le role important joue par la mitochondrie dans la cellule eucaryote est admis depuis longtemps. Cependant, la composition exacte des mitochondries, ainsi que les processus biologiques qui sy deroulent restent encore largement inconnus. Deux facteurs principaux permettent dexpliquer pourquoi letude des mitochondries progresse si lentement : le manque defficacite des methodes didentification des proteines mitochondriales et le manque de precision dans lannotation de ces proteines. En consequence, nous avons developpe un nouvel outil informatique, YimLoc, qui permet de predire avec succes les proteines mitochondriales a partir des sequences genomiques. Cet outil integre plusieurs indicateurs existants, et sa performance est superieure a celle des indicateurs consideres individuellement. Nous avons analyse environ 60 genomes fongiques avec YimLoc afin de lever la controverse concernant la localisation de la beta-oxydation dans ces organismes. Contrairement a ce qui etait generalement admis, nos resultats montrent que la plupart des groupes de Fungi possedent une beta-oxydation mitochondriale. Ce travail met egalement en evidence la diversite des processus de beta-oxydation chez les champignons, en correlation avec leur utilisation des acides gras comme source denergie et de carbone. De plus, nous avons etudie le composant clef de la voie de beta-oxydation mitochondriale, lacyl-CoA deshydrogenase (ACAD), dans 250 especes, couvrant les 3 domaines de la vie, en combinant la prediction de la localisation subcellulaire avec la classification en sous-familles et linference phylogenetique. Notre etude suggere que les genes ACAD font partie dune ancienne famille qui a adopte des strategies evolutionnaires innovatrices afin de generer un large ensemble denzymes susceptibles dutiliser la plupart des acides gras et des acides amines. Finalement, afin de permettre la prediction de proteines mitochondriales a partir de donnees autres que les sequences genomiques, nous avons developpe le logiciel TESTLoc qui utilise comme donnees des Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs).

Sparse methods for wind energy prediction,"In this work we will analyze and apply to the prediction of wind energy some of the best known regularized linear regression algorithms, such as Ordinary Least Squares, Ridge Regression and, particularly, Lasso, Group Lasso and Elastic-Net that also seek to impose a certain degree of sparseness on the final models. To achieve this goal, some of them introduce a non-differentiable regularization term that requires special techniques to solve the corresponding optimization problem that will yield the final model. Proximal Algorithms have been recently introduced precisely to handle this kind of optimization problems, and so we will briefly review how to apply them in regularized linear regression. Moreover, the proximal method FISTA will be used when applying the non-differentiable models to the problem of predicting the global wind energy production in Spain, using as inputs numerical weather forecasts for the entire Iberian peninsula. Our results show how some of the studied sparsity-inducing models are able to produce a coherent selection of features, attaining similar performance to a baseline model using expert information, while making use of less data features.",2012,The 2012 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)

Dimensionality reduction via variables selection â€“ Linear and nonlinear approaches with application to vibration-based condition monitoring of planetary gearbox,"Abstract Feature extraction and variable selection are two important issues in monitoring and diagnosing a planetary gearbox. The preparation of data sets for final classification and decision making is usually a multi-stage process. We consider data from two gearboxes, one in a healthy and the other in a faulty state. First, the gathered raw vibration data in time domain have been segmented and transformed to frequency domain using power spectral density. Next, 15 variables denoting amplitudes of calculated power spectra were extracted; these variables were further examined with respect to their diagnostic ability. We have applied here a novel hybrid approach: all subset search by using multivariate linear regression (MLR) and variables shrinkage by the least absolute selection and shrinkage operator (Lasso) performing a non-linear approach. Both methods gave consistent results and yielded subsets with healthy or faulty diagnostic properties.",2014,Applied Acoustics
The effects of co-morbidity in defining major depression subtypes associated with long-term course and severity.,"BACKGROUND
Although variation in the long-term course of major depressive disorder (MDD) is not strongly predicted by existing symptom subtype distinctions, recent research suggests that prediction can be improved by using machine learning methods. However, it is not known whether these distinctions can be refined by added information about co-morbid conditions. The current report presents results on this question.


METHOD
Data came from 8261 respondents with lifetime DSM-IV MDD in the World Health Organization (WHO) World Mental Health (WMH) Surveys. Outcomes included four retrospectively reported measures of persistence/severity of course (years in episode; years in chronic episodes; hospitalization for MDD; disability due to MDD). Machine learning methods (regression tree analysis; lasso, ridge and elastic net penalized regression) followed by k-means cluster analysis were used to augment previously detected subtypes with information about prior co-morbidity to predict these outcomes.


RESULTS
Predicted values were strongly correlated across outcomes. Cluster analysis of predicted values found three clusters with consistently high, intermediate or low values. The high-risk cluster (32.4% of cases) accounted for 56.6-72.9% of high persistence, high chronicity, hospitalization and disability. This high-risk cluster had both higher sensitivity and likelihood ratio positive (LR+; relative proportions of cases in the high-risk cluster versus other clusters having the adverse outcomes) than in a parallel analysis that excluded measures of co-morbidity as predictors.


CONCLUSIONS
Although the results using the retrospective data reported here suggest that useful MDD subtyping distinctions can be made with machine learning and clustering across multiple indicators of illness persistence/severity, replication with prospective data is needed to confirm this preliminary conclusion.",2014,Psychological medicine
Fast structure learning with modular regularization,"Estimating graphical model structure from high-dimensional and undersampled data is a fundamental problem in many scientific fields. Existing approaches, such as GLASSO, latent variable GLASSO, and latent tree models, suffer from high computational complexity and may impose unrealistic sparsity priors in some cases. We introduce a novel method that leverages a newly discovered connection between information-theoretic measures and structured latent factor models to derive an optimization objective which encourages modular structures where each observed variable has a single latent parent. The proposed method has linear stepwise computational complexity w.r.t. the number of observed variables. Our experiments on synthetic data demonstrate that our approach is the only method that recovers modular structure better as the dimensionality increases. We also use our approach for estimating covariance structure for a number of real-world datasets and show that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art estimators at a fraction of the computational cost. Finally, we apply the proposed method to high-resolution fMRI data (with more than 10^5 voxels) and show that it is capable of extracting meaningful patterns.",2019,
On inhomogeneous models of the early universe,"SummaryAlthough many authors have studied the behaviour of homogeneous models near the cosmological singularity, more general inhomogeneous models, up to now, have not been considered. We study some characteristic properties of these models which may be qualitatively different from the homogeneous case. Reviews are given about the anti-Newtonian and post-anti-Newtonian approximation in the general case, including not only velocity-dominated approximation, but also rotational modes. A simple one-dimensional anisotropic collapse is shown which may appear in the course of evolution. We treat the wave propagation near the singularity, which can appear only in inhomogeneous models, and we show that, before the Kasner or oscillatory stage, there is a stage in which the propagation is dominant. A canonical formalism for wave propagation is expressed.RiassuntoBenchÃ© molti autori abbiano studiato il comportamento dei modelli omogenei vicino alla singolaritÃ  cosmologica, fino ad ora modelli inomogenei piÃ¹ generali non sono stati considerati.

Mediterranean Pathways of Greek Merchants to Victorian England,"This article refers to the emergence of the Greeks as a small ethnic group of merchants in Victorian England and proposes comparisons with other trading groups in London, developing three main points. The first section configures trade migrations in the relevant historiography and argues the link between ethnic community, family firms and individual entrepreneurs in Greek commercial networks; the second section indicates common characteristics of Greek immigrants in England: their Ottoman past and their trade experience in the Italian Peninsula; and the third section concludes with two representative case studies, one of a medium-sized merchant house, and the second representing the longer-lasting and more successful case, a firm that diversified into a global network in direct response to nineteenth-century â€œAnglobalizationâ€. Unreal City Under the brown fog of a winter noon Mr. Eugenides, the Smyrna merchant Unshaven, with a pocket full of currants C.i.f. London: documents at sight These lines are quoted from T. S. Eliotâ€™s The Waste Land, perhaps his most famous work, a controversial poem that details the journey of the human soul searching for redemption. An American-born British subject, T. S. Eliot identified a model Mediterranean merchant and placed him in a wellknown port city, Smyrna, which was famous throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries for the export trade of raisins. Numerous Greek and foreign merchants gathered there, anticipating prices and cargoes for Western Europe. Eliot chose a real Greek merchant, Eugenides, most probably to be identified with Eugenios Eugenides (1883-1954), who originated from Thrace but was established in Constantinople at the turn of the twentieth century. His main business activity started with trading and importing timber from Scandinavia to the Mediterranean. At the time T. S. Eliot published The Waste Land, in 1922, Eugenides was preparing to set up his business in Piraeus, Greece. In the same period and corresponding to his entrepreneurial activities, he obtained a diplomatic The Historical Review / La Revue Historique Institute for Neohellenic Research Volume VII (2010) http://epublishing.ekt.gr | e-Publisher: EKT | Downloaded at 14/03/2019 01:39:51 | 214 Maria Christina Chatziioannou assignment as consul of Finland in Piraeus,1 combining personal economic interests with foreign diplomatic representation in his country. Eugenides became an exemplary agent in the Mediterranean. From Piraeus he moved to Egypt, then to South Africa and finally to Argentina. Soon after World War II, he established in Genoa the international Home Lines Company (1946). Finally, in 1953, he re-established his business in Greece, becoming one of the first Greek ship-owners to repatriate.2 So, Eugenidesâ€™ liners linked the Mediterranean with the Atlantic. We could justly argue that Eugenides had nothing to do with Smyrnaâ€™s raisins, as T. S. Eliot pointed out, not even with Peloponnesian currants, which were one of the predominant import products from the Eastern Mediterranean to Britain in the second half of the nineteenth century. But poets are not bound by factual accuracy or realistic details. Eugenides can be considered as a Greek entrepreneur who thrived in the Mediterranean. It was in the Mediterranean where he accumulated his business culture â€“ in Constantinople â€“ and from there he expanded to the global economy. His entrepreneurial path was based on the commodification of goods and services.3 It involved economic migration, geographical transfer of business activities and personal intuition. Above all, he exemplified the role of the agent, the intermediary of the capitalist economy. The type of trader-entrepreneur that Eugenides represents at the end of the nineteenth century and well into the twentieth had a strong legacy, formed over time by socio-economic conditions and interpreted accordingly by historiography. It evolved from the previous Greek merchant-entrepreneur of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries who traded various import-export commodities and rarely specialised. Their role as intermediary merchants in the foreign trade of the Ottoman Empire has been well documented. The majority were merchants who relied on local products of the Mediterranean region, such as Smyrna raisins, Smyrna cotton, Egyptian cotton and Patras currants, and depended on them in order to expand their entrepreneurial activities. They were all exposed to international demand and faced a high 1 Î•Ï€ÎµÏ„Î·ÏÎ¯Ï‚ Î¥Ï€Î¿Ï…ÏÎ³ÎµÎ¯Î¿Ï… Î•Î¾Ï‰Ï„ÎµÏÎ¹ÎºÏŽÎ½, 1929 [Yearbook of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 1929], pp. 350-351. 2 For information on his life and deeds, see the entry â€œÎ•Ï…Î³Î­Î½Î¹Î¿Ï‚ Î•Ï…Î³ÎµÎ½Î¯Î´Î·Ï‚â€ [Eugenios Eugenides], in K.

It was a large, uneven group that consisted of big-, mediumand small-scale merchants. Eugenidesâ€™ personal itinerary represents some critical issues regarding Greek trader-entrepreneurs as a non-unified body in the Mediterranean: economic migration as an entrepreneurial venture, the role of several Mediterranean economic centres, such as Constantinople, and Italian ports as cosmopolitan maritime-trading centres characterised by pragmatism and pluralism, as well as being foyers of knowledge and entrepreneurial knowhow. Eugenidesâ€™ story is one of many that unfolded in the Mediterranean and determined the fame of â€œThe Corrupting Seaâ€, as the cradle not only of civilisation but also of trade and entrepreneurship. The Mediterranean is a transnational node that links distinct peoples and cultures, a geographical entity that has been described as a â€œuniverseâ€, in which people migrated to and fro: a â€œuniverseâ€ that was integrated into the world economy and the globalised market. Following Braudelâ€™s path, new generations of scholars have analyzed la MÃ©diterranÃ©e as an organizing concept in the world of exchanges, a world that developed through utilizing business organization and networks, a world that surpassed sovereign national boundaries. From early modern times until the industrial era, a non-unified economic world had been created in Europe through commercial transactions, practices and the ethics of business dealings. This geographically structured thesis has been challenged in recent decades by social anthropologists and historians of earlier periods.4 Getting Settled in England: The Prerequisites Î‘round the third decade of the nineteenth century a small ethnic group of merchants began to come into view in Victorian England, the Greeks. It was a group that believed that the growth of trade was among the most important factors in the process of economic development.5 The Greek immigrants to England settled in major economic centres, such as London, Manchester and 4 Peregrine Horden and Nicholas Purcell, The Corrupting Sea: A Study of Mediterranean History, Oxford: Blackwell Publishing, 2000. The same authors continued their critical views on Braudel and the Mediterranean in the AHR forum â€œThe Mediterranean and â€˜the New Thalassologyâ€™â€, American Historical Review CXI/3 (2006), pp. 722-740. 5 Before that, a scanty presence of Greeks in the late seventeenth century has been confirmed, as visitors and isolated residents in London and elsewhere.

Their settlement in England began in the second decade of the nineteenth century, driven by economic reasons and coinciding with the establishment of the Greek State (1828). They were represented collectively by State diplomatic representatives, while the Greek Orthodox church and their private and public lives were regulated by an inter-community set of formal and informal laws. The business group that prevailed within the London Greek community took advantage particularly of three import commodities that created geographical diversification for Greek networks in English markets: silk from the Ottoman Empire for the provisioning of the English silk industry; currants, the main export product of the Greek State after the 1840s; and cereals for the populous English realm after the abolition of the Corn Laws in 1846. Cotton was imported to Liverpool from the USA. However, the American Civil War (1861-1865) and the blockade led to a major reform of this market and increased cotton imports from Egypt and India. After the 1870s and up to World War I, the London Stock Exchange became an important factor in the British economy in trading stocks and shares issued by numerous jointstock enterprises, and this became another entrepreneurial field for Greek businessmen, creating new ethical issues in the Greek mercantile world.6 The origins of these merchants were mostly economic hubs within the borders of the Ottoman Empire. What is interesting to note is that most of these family firms were already in the second phase of their entrepreneurial expansion around the 1830s, having accumulated capital and knowledge in the Eastern Mediterranean. These Ottoman-based firms (Constantinople, Smyrna) had already experienced market conditions in Italian port-cities (like Trieste and Livorno) and Malta and had already established relationships with foreign merchants. The experience that these relationships bore can be th",2011,Historical Review-la Revue Historique
Knowledge guided multi-level network inference,"Constantly decreasing costs of high-throughput profiling on many molecular levels generate vast amounts of so-called multi-omics data. Studying one biomedical question on two or more omic levels provides deeper insights into underlying molecular processes or disease pathophysiology. For the majority of multi-omics data projects, the data analysis is performed level-wise, followed by a combined interpretation of results. Few exceptions exist, for example the pairwise integration for quantitative trait analysis. However, the full potential of integrated data analysis is not leveraged yet, presumably due to the complexity of the data and the lacking toolsets. Here we propose a versatile approach, to perform a multi-level integrated analysis: The Knowledge guIded Multi-Omics Network inference approach, KiMONo. KiMONo performs network inference using statistical modeling on top of a powerful knowledge-guided strategy exploiting prior information from biological sources. Within the resulting network, nodes represent features of all input types and edges refer to associations between them, e.g. underlying a disease. Our method infers the network by combining sparse grouped-LASSO regression with a genomic position-confined Biogrid protein-protein interaction prior. In a comprehensive evaluation, we demonstrate that our method is robust to noise and still performs on low-sample size data. Applied to the five-level data set of the publicly available Pan-cancer collection, KiMONO integrated mutation, epigenetics, transcriptomics, proteomics and clinical information, detecting cancer specific omic features. Moreover, we analysed a four-level data set from a major depressive disorder cohort, including genetic, epigenetic, transcriptional and clinical data. Here we demonstrated KiMONoâ€™s analytical power to identify expression quantitative trait methylation sites and loci and show itâ€™s advantage to state-of-the-art methods. Our results show the general applicability to the full spectrum multi-omics data and demonstrating that KiMONo is a powerful approach towards leveraging the full potential of data sets. The method is freely available as an R package (https://github.com/cellmapslab/kimono).",2020,bioRxiv
Block-Sparse Recurrent Neural Networks,"Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are used in state-of-the-art models in domains such as speech recognition, machine translation, and language modelling. Sparsity is a technique to reduce compute and memory requirements of deep learning models. Sparse RNNs are easier to deploy on devices and high-end server processors. Even though sparse operations need less compute and memory relative to their dense counterparts, the speed-up observed by using sparse operations is less than expected on different hardware platforms. In order to address this issue, we investigate two different approaches to induce block sparsity in RNNs: pruning blocks of weights in a layer and using group lasso regularization with pruning to create blocks of weights with zeros. Using these techniques, we can create block-sparse RNNs with sparsity ranging from 80% to 90% with a small loss in accuracy. This technique allows us to reduce the model size by roughly 10x. Additionally, we can prune a larger dense network to recover this loss in accuracy while maintaining high block sparsity and reducing the overall parameter count. Our technique works with a variety of block sizes up to 32x32. Block-sparse RNNs eliminate overheads related to data storage and irregular memory accesses while increasing hardware efficiency compared to unstructured sparsity.",2017,ArXiv
Ordered homogeneity pursuit lasso for group variable selection with applications to spectroscopic data,"Abstract In high-dimensional data modeling, variable selection methods have been a popular choice to improve the prediction accuracy by effectively selecting the subset of informative variables, and such methods can enhance the model interpretability with sparse representation. In this study, we propose a novel group variable selection method named ordered homogeneity pursuit lasso (OHPL) that takes the homogeneity structure in high-dimensional data into account. OHPL is particularly useful in high-dimensional datasets with strongly correlated variables. We illustrate the approach using three real-world spectroscopic datasets and compare it with four state-of-the-art variable selection methods. The benchmark results on real-world data show that the proposed method is capable of identifying a small number of influential groups and has better prediction performance than its competitors. The OHPL method and the spectroscopic datasets are implemented and included in an R package OHPL available from https://ohpl.io .",2017,Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems

Systemic inequities in introductory physics courses: the impacts of learning assistants,"Creating equitable performance outcomes among students is a focus of many instructors and researchers. One focus of this effort is examining disparities in physics student performance across genders, which is a well-established problem. Another less common focus is disparities across racial and ethnic groups, which may have received less attention due to low representation rates making it difficult to identify gaps in their performance. In this investigation we examined associations between Learning Assistant (LA) supported courses and improved equity in student performance. We built Hierarchical Linear Models of student performance to investigate how performance differed by gender and by race/ethnicity and how LAs may have moderated those differences. Data for the analysis came from pre-post concept inventories in introductory mechanics courses collected through the Learning About STEM Student Outcomes (LASSO) platform. Our models show that gaps in performance across genders and races/ethnicities were similar in size and increased from pre to post instruction. LA-support is meaningfully and reliably associated with improvement in overall student performance but not with shifts in within-course performance gaps.",2017,arXiv: Physics Education
Feature Selection Techniques to Predict the Religion of a Country from Its Flag,"Feature selection is a process of preparing data to be more effective and efficient for machine learning problems. The purpose of feature selection is to select relevant features from huge number of features. To build a simple model which will be easy to understand data and take less time to train the model, thereby optimizing model performance. The paper proposes two feature selection techniques namely Lasso and Select From Model (meta-transformer) to select relevant features from flag dataset that intensifies the model performance.

Kernelized Elastic Net Regularization based on Markov selective sampling,"Abstract This paper extends Kernelized Elastic Net Regularization (KENReg) algorithm from the assumption of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples to the case of non-i.i.d. samples. We first establish the generalization bounds of KENReg algorithm with uniformly ergodic Markov chain samples, then we prove that the KENReg algorithm with uniformly ergodic Markov chain samples is consistent and obtain the fast learning rate of KENReg algorithm with uniformly ergodic Markov chain samples. We also introduce the KENReg algorithm based on Markov selective sampling. Based on Gaussian kernels, the advantages of KENReg algorithm against the traditional one with i.i.d. samples are demonstrated on various real-world datasets. Compared to randomly independent sampling, experimental results show that the KENReg algorithm based on Markov selective sampling not only has much higher prediction accuracy in terms of mean square errors and generates simpler models in terms of the number of non-zero regression coefficients, but also has shorter total time of sampling and training. We compare the algorithm proposed in this paper with these known regularization algorithms, like kernelized Ridge regression and kernelized Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso).",2019,Knowl.

"Biostratigraphy of Section of Murshe-1 Well, Bornu Basin, Northeastern Nigeria","Biostratigraphic work using palynology was undertaken in order to re-assess the lithofacies, chronostratigraphy and paleoenvironment of deposition of sediments in Murshe-1 well, Bornu Basin, northeastern Nigeria. Two hundred and ninety ditch cutting samples obtained from the exploratory well Murshe-1 located in Bornu Basin were used for lithologiacal description. Twenty one (21) samples were selected at 27.4m interval for palynological analysis. The samples were analyzed under microscope for lithologic and palynological description. The latter were taken through sediment digestion and floatation of macerals.

The Empirical Validation of Double / Debiased Machine Learning,"In this paper, a complementary method to classical statistical modeling such as ordinary least squares, and instrumental variables estimation, is introduced. This method, double/debiased machine learning, is applied in the presence of a high-dimensional nuisance parameter set, which possibly interferes with the estimator for the treatment effect. The following techniques are introduced and thoroughly examined: lasso, random forests, neural nets, boosted trees, and an ensemble method. Thereafter, estimates obtained by these techniques are compared to those obtained by traditional OLS and IV estimation. Specifically, research results obtained from Nunn and Wantchekon (2011) and Acemoglu et al. (2005) are used to empirically examine this nonparametric estimation. The hypothesis that DML performs better out-of-sample estimations is supported by Nunn and Wantchekon (2011), which therefore questions the reliability of classical statistical modeling. This hypothesis can not be confirmed nor refuted by Acemoglu et al. (2005).",2018,
Variable Inclusion and Shrinkage Algorithms,"The Lasso is a popular and computationally efficient procedu re for automatically performing both variable selection and coefficient shrinka ge on linear regression models. One limitation of the Lasso is that the same tuning param eter is used for both variable selection and shrinkage. As a result, it typically ends up selecting a model with too many variables to prevent over shrinkage of the regr ession coefficients. We suggest an improved class of methods called â€Variable Inclu sion and Shrinkage Algorithmsâ€ (VISA). Our approach is capable of selecting sparse models while avoiding over shrinkage problems and uses a path algorithm so is also c omputationally efficient. We show through extensive simulations that VISA sign ificantly outperforms the Lasso and also provides improvements over more recent pr ocedures, such as the Dantzig selector, Relaxed Lasso and Adaptive Lasso. In addi tion, we provide theoretical justification for VISA in terms of non-asymptotic bound s on the estimation error that suggest it should exhibit good performance even for lar ge numbers of predictors. Finally, we extend the VISA methodology, path algorithm, an d theoretical bounds to the Generalized Linear Models framework.

"Relazione tecnica sulle attivitÃ  della campagna oceanografica ""AnchevaTir 2012""","Nelle acque Italiane dello Stretto di Sicilia sin dal 1998 vengono effettuate ogni anno campagne di valutazione dellâ€™abbondanza e distribuzione della biomassa pelagica con lâ€™impiego di strumentazione elettroacustica. Dal 2009 lo svolgimento dei survey acustici e parte integrante del Progetto MEDIAS (MEDiterranean International Acoustic Survey), inserito dagli Stati Membri partecipanti al Progetto all'interno del Programma Nazionale 2014-2016. Il Progetto prevede lo svolgimento di survey acustici annuali con lo scopo di valutare la biomassa e la distribuzione spaziale dei piccoli pelagici in aree del Mediterraneo, appartenenti allâ€™Unione Europea. 
Le specie target sono le principali specie commerciali di piccoli pelagici in Mediterraneo, ovvero lâ€™acciuga (Engraulis encrasicolus) e la sardina (Sardina pilchardus). Si tratta di specie a ciclo di vita breve caratterizzate da ampie oscillazioni interannuali nella biomassa. Negli anni in cui i livelli di biomassa sono particolarmente bassi lâ€™effetto di un elevato sforzo di pesca porterebbe ad un collasso di tali risorse anche da un anno allâ€™altro. 
Il collasso di tali specie e stato ben documentato in letteratura mostrando che i tempi di recupero sono molto lunghi e hanno effetti socio-economici catastrofici anche sulle comunita marinare che vivono grazie agli introiti derivanti dalla pesca e commercializzazione di prodotti in scatola. 
La presente relazione mostra le attivita svolte a seguito del survey condotto a bordo della N/O Dallaporta nello Stretto di Sicilia (GSA 16) nellâ€™estate del 2015. Oltre allâ€™acquisizione dei dati acustici, sono state eseguite stazioni di pesca sui piccoli pelagici con rete da traino pelagica sperimentale (volante monobarca), accessoriata con sensori per il controllo dellâ€™apertura e della posizione della rete nella colonna dâ€™acqua. Nellâ€™area di studio sono stati inoltre acquisiti i profili delle principali variabili oceanografiche con sonda multiparametrica CTD.

Sharp Threshold for Multivariate Multi-Response Linear Regression via Block Regularized Lasso,"In this paper, we investigate a multivariate multi-response (MVMR) linear regression problem, which contains multiple linear regression models with differently distributed design matrices, and different regression and output vectors. The goal is to recover the support union of all regression vectors using $l_1/l_2$-regularized Lasso. We characterize sufficient and necessary conditions on sample complexity \emph{as a sharp threshold} to guarantee successful recovery of the support union. Namely, if the sample size is above the threshold, then $l_1/l_2$-regularized Lasso correctly recovers the support union; and if the sample size is below the threshold, $l_1/l_2$-regularized Lasso fails to recover the support union. In particular, the threshold precisely captures the impact of the sparsity of regression vectors and the statistical properties of the design matrices on sample complexity. Therefore, the threshold function also captures the advantages of joint support union recovery using multi-task Lasso over individual support recovery using single-task Lasso.",2013,ArXiv

Adaptive Bayesian SLOPE -- High-dimensional Model Selection with Missing Values,"The selection of variables with high-dimensional and missing data is a major challenge and very few methods are available to solve this problem. Here we propose a new method -- adaptive Bayesian SLOPE -- which is an extension of the SLOPE method of sorted $l_1$ regularization within a Bayesian framework and which allows to simultaneously estimate the parameters and select variables for large data despite missing values. The method follows the idea of the Spike and Slab LASSO, but replaces the Laplace mixture prior with the frequentist motivated ""SLOPE"" prior, which targets control of the False Discovery Rate. The regression parameters and the noise variance are estimated using stochastic approximation EM algorithm, which allows to incorporate missing values as well as latent model parameters, like the signal magnitude and its sparsity. Extensive simulations highlight the good behavior in terms of power, FDR and estimation bias under a wide range of simulation scenarios. Finally, we consider an application of severely traumatized patients from Paris hospitals to predict the level of platelet, and demonstrate, beyond the advantage of selecting relevant variables, which is crucial for interpretation, excellent predictive capabilities. The methodology is implemented in the R package ABSLOPE, which incorporates C++ code to improve the efficiency of the proposed method.",2019,arXiv: Methodology
Toward a systemic analysis of city-agriculture interactions in West Africa: A geography of arrangements between actors,"Despite the importance of urban agriculture in developing countries, urban agriculture is not well understood by public authorities. This lack of knowledge impedes its inclusion in public policies of urban planning. A substantial body of literature deals with urban agriculture but little research has analyzed the multidimensional city-agriculture interactions facilitating its enduring presence within the city. We suggest the hypothesis that informal processes are at the core of the persistence of urban agriculture and propose the concept of socio-spatial arrangements (SSAs) between the actors. To study urban agriculture in Bobo-Dioulasso, a West African city, we propose to develop a geography of arrangements to understand the social and spatial characteristics of SSAs and the way they influence urban agriculture development. Taking the example of market gardeners and pig breeders, we highlight how farmers overcome urban constraints through localized social networks. Results show that arrangements between the actors are at the core of the persistence of urban agriculture. We underline two different socio-spatial morphologies (SSMs) of urban agriculture according to differences in urban agriculture characteristics. These SSMs illustrate how market gardeners and pig breeders integrate differently into the urban space. The systemic approach of studying arrangements between actors helps us understand how urban farming activities function, and how they are connected to each other and to the urban and regional system, thus building a picture of an agri-urban system. We discuss the policy and theoretical implications of this research. This study is aimed at providing a better understanding of urban agriculture that can enhance its consideration as a viable component of the city.",2015,Land Use Policy

On a space-time regularization for force reconstruction problems,"Abstract Tikhonov and LASSO regularizations are commonly used to solve force reconstruction problems in time domain. Unfortunately, these particular forms of additive regularization are not well adapted to tackle both localization and time reconstruction problems simultaneously, since they are generally restricted to the reconstruction of sources sharing the same space and time characteristics. To alleviate this limitation, a multiplicative space-time regularization is introduced. The proposed regularization strategy takes advantage of oneâ€™s prior knowledge of the space-time characteristics of excitation sources. It also introduces a novel reconstruction model based on the generalized- Î± method, which is unconditionally stable and second-order accurate. The validity of the proposed method is assessed numerically and experimentally. In particular, comparisons with standard regularization terms point out the practical benefit in exploiting both spatial and temporal prior information simultaneously in terms of quality and robustness of reconstructed solutions.",2019,Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing
Global Stories on Tactile Hyperglobes â€“ visualizing Global Change Research for Global Change Actors,"ing away from currently limiting factors (e.g. high costs and limited display resolution), which should be solved in accordance with Moore's law in the foreseeable future, the following chapters will focus on programming and visualization problems against the background of user-friendly data presentation. This discussions will be based on the authors' experience with a specific THG at the Department of Geography and Regional Research (IfGR) at the University of Vienna but shall be generalizable in all main aspects. 3 Rendering and 3D-programming requirements Above-cited definition of THG already refers to the main questions, which come along with such visualization platform. On the one hand, data need to be projected onto a 3D-display geometrically correct. On the other hand, the results of this projecting process have to be controllable and accessible in a user-friendly way. The projection problem may be considered as a cartographic basic task: an equirectangular projection of the Earth gets translated into an azimuthal projection. This azimuthal projection includes the path of rays and recurring reflections inside the globe. However, this task's routine ends when it must be done in real-time, which is, firstly, prerequisite for an adequate visualization of global Global Stories on Tactile Hyperglobes change dynamics in the form of animations. Secondly, also the human-hyperglobe interaction via direct manipulation interface needs real-time rendering to give functionalassociative correct feedback to the users in reference to their manipulations. Turning at first to Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in this matter of real-time rendering, we have to state a fundamental improperness of such cartographic software applications for a re-projection and visualization of data with the required frequency. The reason for this is that GIS usually calculate re-projected coordinates separately for each pixel of the initial representation, which is in our case an equirectangular projection of 4096x2048 pixels. Accordingly, computer graphics algorithms (e.g. ray tracing), which exceed the GIS-approach by considering even physical effects (e.g. reflection, refraction, shading) are not suitable for real-time rendering on a THG either. As cartographic standard procedures via GIS fail, 3D graphics programming offers an appropriate alternative, especially since every THG is a 3D-model of reality. An accordant approach we are taking at the IfGR at the moment proceeds on the basis of a 3D computer graphics reproduction of the THG. This 3D reproduction gets rendered 30 times per second into an azimuthal map, which is projected onto the THG afterwards. The techniques of realtime rendering behind this approach allow for the required processing speed while inevitable information loss (in comparison to pixel based methods) can be limited to a reasonable degree. Thereby, accessing comprehensive graphics libraries takes advantage of stable 3D-programming environments that are used and tested in numerous projects, often supported by an active open source community as well. Concretely, the IfGR makes use of the Object-Oriented Graphics Rendering Engine (OGRE) that offers numerous relevant features, e.g. the combination of different layers (cf. chapter 4) or the automatic support of diverse graphics file formats (cf. KRISTEN, forthcoming 2008). 4 Writing Global Stories Based on the approach that has been briefly outlined in chapter 3, we can serve two user groups. These are, on the one hand, experts who impart acquired knowledge of their own domain by means of THG and non-expert users who shall be supported in understanding experts' findings via THG on the other (cf. chapter 5). In regard to the expert user group, it is essential to prepare the THG as an easy to use visualization platform whereon each discipline can build with its own research results. Our approach to achieve this objective is based on a didactic metaphor that conceptualizes complex facts as stories. In these stories different storybook characters can be developed according to the needs of the author/expert and his/her particular discipline. For this purpose, the IfGR provides two software tools. To begin with, the Material Editor (see figure 1) allows to choose from a set of available textures, to assign attributes to the materials (e.g. static vs. dynamic) and to define the materials mutual relationship (e.g. blending). Once prepared, all materials (which will be the story's characters) are available in the Story Editor where stage directions can be given. First of all these directions include temporal instructions, i.e. when a material or the material's attributes are to be changed (e.g. by superimposing another layer). Furthermore, rotational characteristics (e.g. rotational speed and rotational axis) can be modified at any time during a story. In addition, Story Editor also allows to integrate and control audio commentaries and video presentations on external (non-spherical) displays. F. Hruby, J. Kristen and A. Riedl To sum up, Material Editor and Story Editor enable the expert to explain research results in all time-related aspects by means of global stories. Narrational structures can be developed both linearly and non-linearly whereby the Story Editor allows to set bookmarks in the latter case. Finally, another software tool named Story Presenter provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to present and control a global stories on the THG. Fig. 1: Defining materials and materials' attributes for a global story via Material Editor 5 Telling Global Stories The above named development tools address only one aspect of the introductorily discussed communication problem of global change research, namely the possibility of visualizing complex data via stories. However, these stories may only affect the knowledge schemata that have been claimed in chapter 1, if they are accessible to a broad public. Due to the THG's innovativeness level (vs. GIS or analogue globes) and high production costs this precondition is not yet met, though. In Europe, one of the few publicly availably THG at the moment is installed at the Swiss Science Centre (SC) Technorama as a result of a cooperation-project with the IfGR. Insights gained form this project allowed us to improve all software modules in consideration of this SC's concepts of presenting global data: Analogous to the problem of global change research, SC are confronted with the task of explaining global, science based facts to a non-scientific audience: The traditional approach in this regard is based on the learning-by-doing concept. However, this concept is inapplicable in the present case as supraregional phenomena like climate change are not part of the individual's direct experience. In addition, SC are faced with the reporting on climate change in the media where the topic, usually, is either trivialized or presented via dramatically illustrated appeals to fear. Such â€œhorror scenariosâ€ are diametrically opposed to the SC's idea of learning on the basis of positive emotions on the part of the SC's visitor. Against this background, the THG at the Technorama is part of a two-stage explanation process: On the one hand, complex climate phenomena are split into components of lower Global Stories on Tactile Hyperglobes complexity (e.g. albedo, humidity, earth's energy budget) that can be really demonstrated by SC-typical â€œhands-onâ€-experiments. On the other hand, global interconnections of these single components are visualized dynamically on the THG to provide virtual real experience of the Earth's complex climate system. Furthermore, this twofold approach utilizes effects of positive emotions on learning processes. To make effective use of such cognitive resources, we do not emanate from the Earth as the arena of threatening changes but rather presenting initially that blue marble whose photo gain fame in connection with the Apollo 17 space mission. Based on this impression from an astronaut-like point of view, Technorama presents a wide range of results of geosciences and global change research (e.g. El NiÃ±o-southern oscillation, hurricane tracks, global air traffic; see figure 2). Fig. 2: Communicating global data via THG at the Swiss Science Centre Technorama 6 Conclusion and Outlook In the preceding chapters we have tried, in a nutshell, to introduce the THG as emerging visualization technology and to outline its application potential for global change research. However, the following pivotal question has to remain unsolved for the moment: Can we communicate global scale spatial data to non-scientists more efficient by means of (3D) THG than by means of conventional (2D) world maps? How to find an answer to this questions seems to be obvious, namely by comparing THG and world map based on empirical testings. This, however, requires that both visualization types rely on equivalent theoretical and methodical fundaments, designed in accordance with the current level of cartographic knowledge. But cartographic theory does not provide such comprehensive fundaments yet. Rather, we can state two problem areas concerning 3D-visualization of spatial data (cf. HÃ„BERLING, 2003), namely, firstly, a lack of knowledge of how to exhaust and systematize current (and future) technological potentials at the best and, secondly, a severe disregard of user comprehension and target group-specific needs. Both problems must be set against the background of the discipline's principal aims (cf. chapter 1). Research at the IfGR is already on the cusp of solving all visualization-related technical problems (e.g. dot pitch of flat screens vs. spherical displays; render time) to an extent that makes an answer to the two aforenamed problem areas possible and empirical tests reasonable. Encouragingly, recent results of cartographic research already give strong F. Hruby, J. Kristen and A. Riedl reason to hope that our research efforts are worthwhile and justi",2008,
Neoproterozoic Microfossils from Northern Jiangsu and Anhui,"Abundant microfossils were uncovered in marine Neoproterozoic shales, siltstones, and cherts in northern Jiangsu and Anhui provinces, East China. Microfossils in clastic rocks are extracted by maceration and 14 genera and species are identified. Coccoid and filamental cyanobacterial microfossils are three dimensionally well preserved in cherts and 6 taxa are recognized in petrographic thin sections. Macerated microfossils in the upper and middle parts of the Neoproterozoic Liulaobei Formation mainly are fragments with multilayers or monolayers and sphaeromorphs. They are Laminarites antiquissimus, Leiosphaeridia pelucida, Spumiosa alara , and Aspera topsophosphaera bavlinensis . Only two types, Monilinema quadratucella and Synsphaeridium sp., are collected from the Jiuliqiao, Jiayuan and Zhaowei formations, which are polyhedrical or spherical in shape. Abundant spherical and filamental microfossils are macerated from the clastic rocks of the Shijia, Jin shanzhai and Gouhou formations, including Leiosphae ridia hyperboreica, Trachysphaeridium simplex, Annulum difuminatum, Nucellosphaeridium asperatum, Tophoporata sp., Symplassosphaeridium sp., Macro ptycha uniplicata and Taeniatum simplex . This microfossil assemblage can be compared with those of the Neoproterozoic Jingeryu and Xiamaling formations in Jixian, Tianjin, and Hebei Province. Although the systematic paleontology of the above mentioned microfossils is still under investigation, they could provide us with phytoplanktonic data for understanding the biosphere of the coastal marine environment shortly before the Neoproterozoic glaciations. Well preserved three dimensional microfossils, including filamental and coccoid cyanobacteria, occur in the cherts of the Neoproterozoic Niyuan and Jiudingshan formations in northern Anhui and Jiangsu provinces. They are Siphonophycus sp., Eoentophysalis belcherensis, Eozygion grande, Tetraphycus conjionceum, Globophycus rugosum , and Caryosphae roides pristine . This cyanobacteria assemblage was probably benthic, and occurred in nonstromatolitic carbonate depositional environment.",2002,
"The Impact of customers' relation quality and sensing on the marketing performance for micro industries development in Banten Province, Indonesia","This research was intended to evaluate the marketing performance as one of the food and beverage Micro Industries (MI's) constraints in Banten Province. We built a relation model between the marketing performance and the customer's relation quality and sensing by which they determined some empowerment development strategies for independence and capable MI. Data for the model building was taken by interview based on a set of questionnaire to the 130 chosen respondents by simple random sampling. They were split into training and test sets. Then three regression models were applied namely best-subset, ridge, and lasso regression model to the training set. The result showed that the ridge regression model was the best model having the smallest MSE (Mean Squared Error). When it applied to the test set, its standardized coefficients showed the customers' relation quality needed to be improved for the MI development strategies. There were keeping, offering, and maintaining strategies as the main strategies to develop the MI. The keeping strategy related to trust and agreement, while the offering strategy was supplying products and information. The maintaining strategy, on the other hand, was preserving emotional closeness.",2014,Review of applied socio-economic research
Eosinophilic Allergic Polyp,"and after oral GC therapy (GC-treated) and 8 controls of inferior turbinate mucosa were included. cDNA microarray analysis, together with histoand immunohistochemical validation, was performed. RESULTS: Infiltration of eosinophils and neutrophils was prominent in GC-nave NP. GC was effective in reducing the recruitment of both nasal mucosal eosinophils and neutrophils. Thirty-one eosinophil-associated genes were differentially expressed in GC-nave NP versus control. Expression of five genes (MMP9, NR4A1, NR4A2, CD69 and DUSP1) demonstrated a significant change after GC treatment. On the other hand, expressions of 14 neutrophil-associated genes were different in GC-nave NP versus control and 3 of them (MMP7, MMP9 and CXCL2) were responsive to GC therapy. Immuno-staining showed the co-localization of MMP7 and MMP9 with neutrophils and the decrease of these proteins in NP after GC treatment. NR4A1/NR4A2 proteins were absent in eosinophils from all GC-nave NP but present in some GC-treated NP. CONCLUSION: GC is effective in inhibiting both eosinophil and neutrophil infiltration in NP, which can be demonstrated by modulation of those important eosinophiland neutrophilassociated genes.",2010,Otolaryngology- Head and Neck Surgery
Gene Risk Scores Based on Expression of 6 Genes Quanitated by Nuclease Protection Assay in Formalin Fixed Paraffin-Embedded Tissue (FFPET) Specimens From CHOP and RCHOP Treated Patients with Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) Predict Outcome: An ECOG and SWOG Study,"Abstract 87 

Background: The International Prognostic Index (IPI) remains the most powerful predictor of clinical outcome in DLBCL in the R-CHOP era, serving as a useful surrogate for the biology we are just beginning to understand. With a follow-up of more than 9 years, its uniformly staged and treated patients and its prospectively collected unstained slides for correlative studies, the clinical data set from E4494, the US Intergroup trial comparing CHOP and RCHOP in patients >60 years with DLBCL, stands as a valuable resource for investigating prognosis in DLBCL. Based on immunohistochemistry, we previously showed that rituximab modulates the prognostic significance of some biomarkers in DLBCL. With these same specimens, the quantitative nuclease protection assay (qNPA), a methodology for measuring mRNA levels in FFPET, was used to develop separate prognostic signatures for the CHOP and RCHOP arms that can be simply applied using stored unstained slides.

Methods: Five micron unstained FFPET sections from 183 eligible and evaluable cases enrolled on E4494 and submitted for prospective immunohistochemical correlative studies more than ten years ago were used for this analysis. Tissue was scraped from slides and a multiplexed qNPA was performed in triplicate using a customized Array Plate assay (HTG, Inc) for 43 genes of interest. TBP served as a housekeeping gene. Association between standardized log gene expression and patient failure-free survival (FFS) and overall survival (OS) was obtained using the Cox proportional hazards model. A weighted analysis was used to eliminate the confounding effect of maintenance rituximab. Genes that showed at least marginal significance in the univariate analysis were used to perform LASSO (penalized method to select best subset) to select a final list of genes in the multivariate analysis. Using the predictive model for either CHOP or R-CHOP induction, individual risk scores were calculated based on the multivariable model, and cases were dichotomized into low and high risk groups based on the median risk score. The model was then validated using the Lenz dataset (NEJM, 2008).

Results: In six cases, tissue from slides prepared >10 years ago was compared to freshly cut sections from corresponding blocks, and showed excellent concordance (corr=0.86). On-study characteristics for the 176 cases with analyzable data were representative of the greater E4494 patient population. Six gene predictors were developed for each arm of the trial: RCHOP: FN1, LMO2, AKT1, HIF1a, AKT3, BCL2; and CHOP: PDCD4, HLADRB1, COL3A1, LMO2, ROBO4, TP53. Both signatures proved powerful predictors of FFS and OS among CHOP (FFS: p=0.0031; OS: p=0.0013) and RCHOP (FFS: p=0.001; OS=p=0.0015) treated patients. When adjusted for the clinically-based IPI, the gene-risk score retained its significance (CHOP: FFS p=0.0007; OS p=0.0011; RCHOP: FFS p=0.003; OS, p=0.001) while the IPI became only marginally significant (CHOP: FFS: p=0.06, OS p=0.06; R-CHOP: FFS p=0.09, OS p=0.02), suggesting that the gene predictor accounted for much of the predictive power of the IPI.

The predictive model was then validated using the Lenz dataset for OS. The predictor models for CHOP and R-CHOP-treated patients effectively dichotomized patients into prognostic subgroups (CHOP: p<0.0001; RCHOP: p=0.0014; see figure below) and this difference was maintained when the subset over age 60 was analyzed (CHOP: p=0.0008; RCHOP: p=0.017). When adjusted for the IPI, the molecular predictor developed for CHOP treated patients remained robust (OS: P=.0001; HR 2.39), while the molecular predictor for RCHOP predicted OS marginally (p=.06; HR 1.82), with shorter followup than the CHOP cohort.

Conclusions: Unstained slides from FFPET stored for many years may be used to investigate gene expression in lymphoma biopsy specimens for which there is mature followup. Gene risk scores based on the expression of a limited number of genes are powerful predictors of clinical outcome.

Regularized multivariate stochastic regression,"In many high dimensional problems, the dependence structure among the variables can be quite complex. An appropriate use of the regularization techniques coupled with other classical statistical methods can often improve estimation and prediction accuracy and facilitate model interpretation, by seeking a parsimonious model representation that involves only the subset of revelent variables. We propose two regularized stochastic regression approaches, for efficiently estimating certain sparse dependence structure in the data. We first consider a multivariate regression setting, in which the large number of responses and predictors may be associated through only a few channels/pathways and each of these associations may only involve a few responses and predictors. We propose a regularized reduced-rank regression approach, in which the model estimation and rank determination are conducted simultaneously and the resulting regularized estimator of the coefficient matrix admits a sparse singular value decomposition (SVD). Secondly, we consider model selection of subset autoregressive moving-average (ARMA) modelling, for which automatic selection methods do not directly apply because the innovation process is latent. We propose to identify the optimal subset ARMA model by fitting a penalized regression, e.g. adaptive Lasso, of the time series on its lags and the lags of the residuals from a long autoregression fitted to the time-series data, where the residuals serve as proxies for the innovations. Computation algorithms and regularization parameter selection methods for both proposed approaches are developed, and their properties are ex-",2011,

Bayesian lasso regression,"The lasso estimate for linear regression corresponds to a posterior mode when independent, double-exponential prior distributions are placed on the regression coefficients. This paper introduces new aspects of the broader Bayesian treatment of lasso regression. A direct characterization of the regression coefficients' posterior distribution is provided, and computation and inference under this characterization is shown to be straightforward. Emphasis is placed on point estimation using the posterior mean, which facilitates prediction of future observations via the posterior predictive distribution. It is shown that the standard lasso prediction method does not necessarily agree with model-based, Bayesian predictions. A new Gibbs sampler for Bayesian lasso regression is introduced.

Determinants de la concentraciÃ³ plasmÃ tica de la LipoproteÃ¯na (a)en la malaltia cardiovascular.,"EnglishLipoprotein (a) is a class of lipoprotein particles resembling low density lipoprotein (LDL) in which apo B100 is covalently linked to a high polymorphic glycoprotein apolipoprotein termed apo(a). Although the physiological function of Lp(a) is unknown, numerous epidemiological studies have shown that a high plasma concentration of Lp(a) represent an independent risk factor for the development of coronary heart disease, however some confusing results in some of this studies has been reported. Apo(a) shares a high structural homology with plasminogen As plasminogen, apo(a) kringle domains contain Lysine Binding Site(s) (LBS) that interact with residues of lysine. Kringle IV10 of apo(a) is the primary LBS of Lp(a) and is associated with lesion formation on transgenic mice . The purpose of this study was Â· To examine de association of Lp(a) concentration, apo(a) size and Lp(a) lysine-binding site in patients with early onset heart diseases and age matched controls. Â· Search for mutations in the apo(a) kringle IV10 which could alter the LBS activity of Lp(a) Â· to investigate the decrease in Lp(a) values in samples from controls and patients with established cardiovascular disease that had been frozen for 5 years and to analyze the relationship between such decrease and the number of kringle IV repeats in the smallest and largest isoforms. Methods Blood was obtained from survivors of premature myocardial infarction and age matched controls, plasma was measured by immunoturbidimetry , apo(a) genotype was determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, apo(a) phenotype by gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting, LBS activity was measured by a quantitative LBS-Lp(a) immunoassay as previously described. Detection of mutations and polymorphisms in kringle IV10 was revealed by PCR amplification and applying SSCP analysis to the product Results See also: Simo JM, Camps J, Vilella E, Gomez F, Paul A, Joven J.

Impact of apolipoprotein(a) isoform size heterogeneity on the lysine binding function of lipoprotein(a) in early onset coronary artery disease. Thromb Haemost. 2001 Mar;85(3):412-7. Â· In the patients, Lp(a) concentration was higher, apo(a) size was smaller, and LBS activity higher in the small isoforms compared to the controls. Â· We identified a novel mutation in a patient heterozygous for the mutation The mutation W81R previously identified in humans was not found in our sample, but the M75T mutation was frequent.. The genotype TT conferred a significant risk for myocardial infarction but was not associated with the LBS function of apo(a). Â· During storage, mean Lp(a) decreased significantly in samples from patients but not in samples from controls This was not related to the kringle number and was limited to samples with initial plasma Lp(a) concentrations between 41 and 345 mg/L. Conclusions Â· This study suggests an association of high LBS activity in small isoforms of Lp(a) with disease in humans. Â· W81R mutation if present is infrequent in Spanish population Â· Plasma Lp(a) from patients is less stable than Lp(a) from controls, and the difference is not related to distribution of apo(a) genotypes but may be concentration-dependent. Differential sample stability may complicate the interpretation of several studies. catalaLa Lipoproteina (a) es una classe de lipoproteina semblant a les lipoproteines de baixa densitat (LDL), en la que lapo B100 esta unida de forma covalent a una glicoproteina molt polimorfica de mida, anomenada apo(a). Si be la seva funcio fisiologica es desconeguda, nombrosos estudis epidemiologics han demostrat que la concentracio plasmatica elevada de Lp(a) representa un factor de risc independent de desenvolupar una malaltia cardiovascular. Alguns daquests estudis pero han donat lloc a resultants contradictoris. Lapo(a) comparteix amb el plasminogen una forta homologia estructural. Com el plasminogen, sestructura en dominis proteics o Kringles que contenen regions anomenades LBS (Lysine Binding Site)capaces dinteraccionar amb els residus de lisina de les proteines. En lapo(a) el Kringle IV10 confereix la funcio LBS a la Lp(a). El proposit daquest estudi ha estat el de: Â· Examinar lassociacio entre la concentracio de Lp(a), la mida de lapo(a) i la funcio LBS en pacients amb infart agut de miocardi prematur i els seus respectius controls. Â· Cercar mutacions en kringle IV10 de lapo(a) que puguin alterar lactivitat LBS de la Lp(a). Â· Investigar lefecte que lemmagatzematge de les mostres congelades durant 5 anys te en la concentracio de Lp(a) i analitzar la relacio daquest efecte amb el numero de repeticions del kringle IV dels seus alÂ·lels.

Â· En els pacients la concentracio de Lp(a) es mes elevada, la mida de lapo(a) mes petita i lactivitat LBS mes alta en les isoformes mes petites comparat amb els controls. Â· Hem identificat una nova mutacio en heterozigosi en un pacient. La mutacio W81R identificada previament en humans no ha estat trobada en la nostra mostra en canvi la mutacio M75T es frequent. Aquesta mutacio no modifica la funcio LBS pero el genotip TT sassocia amb risc de patir una malaltia cardiovascular. Â· Durant lemmagatzematge de les mostres la Lp(a) perd immunoreactivitat de forma significativa en pacients pero no en controls. Aquesta perdua no es relaciona amb el numero de kringle i es limita a mostres amb concentracions inicials entre 41 i 345 mg/L. Conclusions Â· Aquest estudi suggereix una associacio entre malaltia cardiovascular, activitat LBS elevada i isoformes petites. Â· La mutacio W81R, si esta present, es molt poc frequent en la poblacio espanyola. Â· La concentracio plasmatica de Lp(a) dels pacients es menys estable que la dels controls, les diferencies no es relacionen amb la distribucio dels genotips pero poden ser dependents de la concentracio Aquestes diferencies poden complicar la interpretacio dalgun estudis.",2003,
Comparisons of single-stage and two-stage approaches to genomic selection,"Genomic selection (GS) is a method for predicting breeding values of plants or animals using many molecular markers that is commonly implemented in two stages. In plant breeding the first stage usually involves computation of adjusted means for genotypes which are then used to predict genomic breeding values in the second stage. We compared two classical stage-wise approaches, which either ignore or approximate correlations among the means by a diagonal matrix, and a new method, to a single-stage analysis for GS using ridge regression best linear unbiased prediction (RR-BLUP). The new stage-wise method rotates (orthogonalizes) the adjusted means from the first stage before submitting them to the second stage. This makes the errors approximately independently and identically normally distributed, which is a prerequisite for many procedures that are potentially useful for GS such as machine learning methods (e.g. boosting) and regularized regression methods (e.g. lasso). This is illustrated in this paper using componentwise boosting. The componentwise boosting method minimizes squared error loss using least squares and iteratively and automatically selects markers that are most predictive of genomic breeding values. Results are compared with those of RR-BLUP using fivefold cross-validation. The new stage-wise approach with rotated means was slightly more similar to the single-stage analysis than the classical two-stage approaches based on non-rotated means for two unbalanced datasets. This suggests that rotation is a worthwhile pre-processing step in GS for the two-stage approaches for unbalanced datasets. Moreover, the predictive accuracy of stage-wise RR-BLUP was higher (5.0â€“6.1Â %) than that of componentwise boosting.",2012,Theoretical and Applied Genetics
Improving spatial predictions of animal resource selection to guide conservation decision making.,"Resource selection is often studied by ecologists interested in the environmental drivers of animal space use and movement. These studies commonly produce spatial predictions, which are of considerable utility to resource managers making habitat and population management decisions. It is thus paramount that predictions from resource selection studies are accurate. We evaluated model building and fitting strategies for optimizing resource selection function predictions in a use-availability framework. We did so by simulating low- and high-intensity spatial sampling data that respectively predicted study area and movement-based resource selection. We compared one of the most commonly used forms of statistical regularization, Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC), with the lesser used least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). LASSO predictions were less variable and more accurate than AIC and were often best when considering additive and interacting variables. We explicitly demonstrate the predictive equivalence using the logistic and Poisson likelihoods and how it is lost when the available sample is too small. Regardless of modeling approach, interpreting the sign of coefficients as a measure of selection can be misleading when optimizing for prediction.",2019,Ecology

Aging-related electrophysiological changes of pulmonary atrial sleeves in dogs,"Objective To detect the aging-related changes in electrophysiologic properties of pulmonary myocardial sleeves in dogs and to seek the experimental evidence for primary or independent factor contributing to atrial fibrillation(AF) incidence. Methods Two 4-electrode catheters were inserted through the right femoral vein and fixed to the upper lateral wall of right atrium and the junction of superior vena cava with right atrium under the guide of fluoroscopy. A decapolar catheter was inserted into the coronary sinus via the internal jugular vein. Transseptal puncture was accomplished and a radiofrequency catheter and a 10-electrode catheter(Lasso) was placed into left atrium and pulmonary vein. Effective refractory period(ERP), conduction property, AF thresholds at different sites were measured by programmed stimulation and short burst stimuli. Results ERPs at pulmonary veins, superior vena cava, two atria and coronary sinus in old dogs were shorter than those in adult group. Among them, the differences in ERPs of left atrium, superior vena cava and pulmonary veins between old and adult dogs had statistical significance(P0.01). In old group, the ERP of pulmonary veins was shorter than that of left atrium; but in adult group, there was no difference between them. The conduction of impulses in superior vena cava and pulmonary veins in old group showed significant progressive decrement. AF lasting longer than 30 seconds could be induced only at left atrium, superior vena cava and pulmonary veins in old dogs through programmed stimulation and short burst stimuli. In adult dogs, no induced AF occurred in spite of increasing stimulation threshold and rate. Conclusion The aging-related changes in electrophysiological properties of pulmonary myocardial sleeves facilitates the initiation of AF. Aging-related changes of the heart might offer potential substrate for AF.",2005,Chinese Journal of Multiple Organ Diseases in the Elderly
A Feature Sampling Strategy for Analysis of High Dimensional Genomic Data,"With the development of high throughput technology, it has become feasible and common to profile tens of thousands of gene activities simultaneously. These genomic data typically have sample size of hundreds or fewer, which is much less than the feature size (number of genes). In addition, the genes, in particular the ones from the same pathway, are often highly correlated. These issues impose a great challenge for selecting meaningful genes from a large number of (correlated) candidates in many genomic studies. Quite a few methods have been proposed to attack this challenge. Among them, regularization-based techniques, e.g., lasso, become much more appealing, because they can do model fitting and variable selection at the same time. However, the lasso regression has its known limitations. One is that the number of genes selected by the lasso couldnâ€™t exceed the number of samples. Another limitation is that, if causal genes are highly correlated, the lasso tends to select only one or few genes from them. Biologists, however, desire to identify them all. To overcome these limitations, we present here a novel, robust, and stable variable selection method. Through simulation studies and a real application to the transcriptome data, we demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in selecting highly correlated causal genes. We also provide some theoretical justifications for this feature sampling strategy based on the mean and variance analyses.",2019,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics
Detection of Multiple Changes in Mean by Sparse Parameter Estimation,"The contribution is focused on detection of multiple changes in
the mean in a onedimensional stochastic process by sparse
parameter estimation from an overparametrized model. The
authorsâ€™ approach to change point detection differs entirely
from standard statistical techniques. A stochastic process
residing in a bounded interval with changes in the mean is
estimated using dictionary (a family of functions, the
so-called atoms, which are overcomplete in the sense of being
nearly linearly dependent) and consisting of Heaviside
functions. Among all possible representations of the process we
want to find a sparse one utilizing a significantly reduced
number of atoms. This problem can be solved by
\ell_1-minimization. The basis pursuit algorithm is used to get
sparse parameter estimates. In this contribution the authors
calculate empirical probability of successful change point
detection as a function depending on the number of change
points and the level of standard deviation of additive white
noise of the stochastic process. The empirical probability was
computed by simulations where locations of change points were
chosen randomly from uniform distribution. The authorsâ€™
approach is compared with LASSO algorithm, \ell_1 trend
filtering and selected statistical methods. Such probability
decreases with increasing number of change points and/or
standard deviation of white noise. The proposed method was
applied on the time series of nuclear magnetic response during
the drilling of a well.",2013,Nonlinear Analysis-Modelling and Control
[Sleeping sickness in children at Bobo-Dioulasso Hospital Center: apropos of 3 cases].,The authors report three observations of trypanosomiasis in children aged 3 to 13 years from Ivory Coast and Burkina Faso. Two cases were imported from CÃ´te d'Ivoire and one originated from an old endemic area of Bobo-Dioulasso region in Burkina Faso. Clinical features were comparable to classical descriptions in adults but neurological findings were dominant. Two children were at the lymphatic stage. Treatment with melarsoprol in two cases and eflornithine in one case led to complete recovery. Active epidemiologic surveillance of this zoonosis should be maintained and the devastating pandemic of the beginning of the century should be remembered.,1999,Bulletin de la Societe de pathologie exotique

Regularising the Factor Zoo with OWL Chuanping Sun,"Hundreds of anomaly variables have been proposed, claiming explanatory power to the cross-section of average returns in equity market. Cochrane (2011) dubs this phenomenon the â€factor zooâ€ and further argues that the characteristic related factors to explain the average returns are in disarray. This paper introduces a newly developed machine learning tool, ordered and weighted L1 norm regularisation (OWL) to â€regulariseâ€ this chaotic â€factor zooâ€. The innovation of OWL is that high correlations among explanatory variables are permitted. Highly correlated variables will be identified simultaneously and grouped together. This is important because factor correlation prevails in high dimensionality and biases standard estimators (Fama-MacBeth regression, LASSO, etc.) yet it has not been discussed extensively in the literature. Empirical evidence suggests that â€™liquidityâ€™ related factors play an important role in explaining the cross-section of average returns. Further robustness check shows that OWL selected factors have superior performance in a broad range of criteria. Out-of-sample Sharpe ratio of hedge portfolio, formed using OWL selected factors as predictors in the past two decades, is around 3.5 (annualised) considering all stocks, and above 2.2 when excluding micro stocks.

Automatic Security Classification with Lasso,"With an increasing amount of generated information, also within security domains, there is a growing need for tools that can assist with automatic security classification. The state-of-the art today is the use of simple classification lists ""dirty word lists"" for reactive content checking. In the future, however, we expect there will be both proactive tools for security classification assisting humans when creating the information object and reactive tools i.e. double-checking the content in a guard. This paper demonstrates the use of machine learning with Lasso Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator [1, 2] both to two-class binary and multi-class security classification. We also explore the ability of Lasso to create sparse solutions that are easy for humans to analyze and interpret, in contrast to many other machine learning techniques that do not possess an explanatory nature.",2015,
Use of Feed Resources in Intensive Urban Ruminant Production Systems of West Africa: A Case Study from Burkina Faso,"A longitudinal study was conducted in the built-up area of Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina Faso) to assess the resource use efficiency in zero-grazing beef cattle production enterprises, determine the animalsâ€™ liveweight (LW) changes; and evaluate whether the feeding regime was able to meet the animalsâ€™ energy requirements for maintenance and growth. Five representative farms were purposively selected out of a total of 133 farms surveyed in a previous study. The average number of cattle per farm was 3.6Â±2.01. Measurements were carried out in bi-weekly intervals for ten months. LW of animals averaged 270Â±128.8 kg and LW gain (LWG) ranged from 162 to 423g/day with an average of 290Â±161 g/day. The average daily supplies of crude protein (CPoffer) and metabolizable energy (MEoffer) of 25Â±12.7g/kg0.75 and 1.3Â±0.67 MJ/kg0.75 (dry season) and 33Â±9.6 g/kg0.75 and 1.8Â±0.63 MJ/kg0.75 (rainy season), respectively, clearly exceeded the animalsâ€™ requirements for maintenance plus growth. Hence, the calculated conversion ratios for offered feed and protein as well as energy use efficiency were very low. With the current management, part of the offered feeds ends up at the dung heap. Monthly manure mass collected per farm and tropical livestock unit averaged 93Â±30.9 kg dry matter; if well recycled, it could contribute substantially to crop production and yield high revenue, especially, in urban vegetable production.",2019,Animal Nutrition and Feed Technology
Statistical inference for high dimensional regression via Constrained Lasso,"In this paper, we propose a new method for estimation and constructing confidence intervals for low-dimensional components in a high-dimensional model. The proposed estimator, called Constrained Lasso (CLasso) estimator, is obtained by simultaneously solving two estimating equations---one imposing a zero-bias constraint for the low-dimensional parameter and the other forming an $\ell_1$-penalized procedure for the high-dimensional nuisance parameter. By carefully choosing the zero-bias constraint, the resulting estimator of the low dimensional parameter is shown to admit an asymptotically normal limit attaining the Cramer-Rao lower bound in a semiparametric sense. We propose a tuning-free iterative algorithm for implementing the CLasso. We show that when the algorithm is initialized at the Lasso estimator, the de-sparsified estimator proposed in van de Geer et al. [\emph{Ann. Statist.} {\bf 42} (2014) 1166--1202] is asymptotically equivalent to the first iterate of the algorithm. We analyse the asymptotic properties of the CLasso estimator and show the globally linear convergence of the algorithm. We also demonstrate encouraging empirical performance of the CLasso through numerical studies.",2017,arXiv: Methodology

On the Adaptive Elastic-net with a Diverging Number of Parameters.,"We consider the problem of model selection and estimation in situations where the number of parameters diverges with the sample size. When the dimension is high, an ideal method should have the oracle property (Fan and Li, 2001; Fan and Peng, 2004) which ensures the optimal large sample performance. Furthermore, the high-dimensionality often induces the collinearity problem which should be properly handled by the ideal method. Many existing variable selection methods fail to achieve both goals simultaneously. In this paper, we propose the adaptive Elastic-Net that combines the strengths of the quadratic regularization and the adaptively weighted lasso shrinkage. Under weak regularity conditions, we establish the oracle property of the adaptive Elastic-Net. We show by simulations that the adaptive Elastic-Net deals with the collinearity problem better than the other oracle-like methods, thus enjoying much improved finite sample performance.",2009,Annals of statistics
Frank-Wolfe with Subsampling Oracle,"We analyze two novel randomized variants of the Frank-Wolfe (FW) or conditional gradient algorithm. While classical FW algorithms require solving a linear minimization problem over the domain at each iteration, the proposed method only requires to solve a linear minimization problem over a small \emph{subset} of the original domain. The first algorithm that we propose is a randomized variant of the original FW algorithm and achieves a $\mathcal{O}(1/t)$ sublinear convergence rate as in the deterministic counterpart. The second algorithm is a randomized variant of the Away-step FW algorithm, and again as its deterministic counterpart, reaches linear (i.e., exponential) convergence rate making it the first provably convergent randomized variant of Away-step FW. In both cases, while subsampling reduces the convergence rate by a constant factor, the linear minimization step can be a fraction of the cost of that of the deterministic versions, especially when the data is streamed. We illustrate computational gains of the algorithms on regression problems, involving both $\ell_1$ and latent group lasso penalties.",2018,
High-dimensional Linear Regression Analysis by using Genetic Algorithm,"The research objective is to study the effectiveness of parameter estimation and variable selection by using genetic algorithm in the high-dimensional linear regression analysis. The results of the proposed method from the simulation are compared with the other three well-known methods: lasso, elastic net, and stepwise regression. The comparison criteria are the percentage of the number of correct fitting models, the percentage of the number of over-fitting models, the percentage of the number of under-fitting models, the percentage of the number of incorrect fitting models including mean squared error and the accuracy of the parameter estimates. It can be concluded that the direct selection by genetic algorithm yields the best results when compared with the other three methods in nearly all cases.

Sparsity Pattern Recovery in Compressed Sensing,"Author(s): Reeves, Galen | Advisor(s): Gastpar, Michael | Abstract: The problem of recovering sparse signals from a limited number of measurements is now ubiquitous in signal processing, statistics, and machine learning. A natural question of fundamental interest is that of what can and cannot be recovered in the presence of noise. This thesis provides a sharp characterization for the task of sparsity pattern recovery (also known as support recovery). Using tools from information theory, we find a sharp separation into two problem regimes -- one in which the problem is fundamentally noise-limited, and a more interesting one in which the problem is limited by the behavior of the sparse components themselves. This analysis allows us to identify settings where existing computationally efficient algorithms, such as the LASSO or approximate message passing, are optimal as well as other settings where these algorithms are highly suboptimal. We compare our results to predictions of phase transitions made via the powerful but heuristic replica method, and find that our rigorous bounds confirm some of these predictions.The remainder of the thesis explores extensions of our bounds to various scenarios. We consider specially structured sampling matrices and show how such additional structure can make a key difference, analogous to the role of diversity in wireless communications. Finally, we illustrate how the new bounding techniques introduced in this thesis can be used to establish information-theoretic secrecy results for certain communication channel models that involve eavesdroppers.",2011,
Using Discriminative Lasso to Detect a Graph Fourier Transform (GFT) Subspace for robust decoding in Motor Imagery BCI,"A novel decoding scheme for motor imagery (MI) brain computer interfaces (BCIâ€™s) is introduced based on the GFT concept. It considers the recorded EEG activity as a signal defined over (the graph of) the sensor array. A graph encapsulating the functional covariations emerging during the execution of a specific imagined movement is first defined, from a small training set of relevant trials. The ensemble of graphs signals corresponding to a multi-trial training dataset is then analyzed using a graph-guided decomposition and, based on discriminative Lasso (dLasso), an information-rich GFT subspace is defined. After training, only simple matrix operations are required for transforming the multichannel signal into features to be fed into a classifier that decides whether brain activity conforms with the graph structure associated with the targeted movement. The proposed decoding scheme is evaluated based on two different datasets and found to compare favorably against popular alternatives in the field.",2019,2019 41st Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)
Effect of the magnetic pressure on cloud evolution,"SummaryThe effect of the magnetic pressure on gravitational collapse leading to star formation is analysed for a wide range of masses and initial values of the temperature and of the field. The collapse time increases, passing sometimes from free fall to quasi-equilibrium.

This last possibility is real, even if limited to peculiar cases.RiassuntoSi studia l'effetto della pressione magnetica sul collasso gravitazionale di nubi interstellari nei processi che precedono la formazione di stelle e di sistemi stellari e per un ampio ventaglio di masse e di valori iniziali del campo magnetico e della temperatura.

Identification of a novel four-lncRNA signature as a prognostic indicator in cirrhotic hepatocellular carcinoma,"Background
Many studies have shown that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) are closely associated with the occurrence and development of various tumors and have the potential to be prognostic markers. Moreover, cirrhosis is an important prognostic risk factors in patients with liver cancer. Some studies have reported that lncRNA-related prognostic models have been used to predict overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, no one has constructed a prognostic lncRNA model only in patients with cirrhotic HCC. Thus, it is necessary to screen novel potential lncRNA markers for improve the prognosis of cirrhotic HCC patients.


Methods
The probe expression profile dataset (GSE14520-GPL3921) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), which included 204 cirrhotic HCC samples, was reannotated and the lncRNA and mRNA expression dataset was obtained. The patients were randomly assigned to either the training set (nÂ =Â 103) and testing set (nÂ =Â 100). Univariate cox regression and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) model were applied to screen lncRNAs linked to the OS of cirrhotic HCC in the training set. The lncRNAs having significant correlation with OS were then selected and the multivariate Cox regression model was implemented to construct the prognostic score model. Whether or not this model was related to RFS in the training set was simultaneously determined. The testing set was used to validate the lncRNA risk score model. A risk score based on the lncRNA signature was used for stratified analysis of different clinical features to test their prognostic performance. The prognostic lncRNA-related protein genes were identified by the co-expression matrix of lncRNA-mRNA, and the function of these lncRNAs was predicted through the enrichment of these co-expression genes.


Results
The signature consisted of four lncRNAs:AC093797.1,POLR2J4,AL121748.1 and AL162231.4. The risk model was closely correlated with the OS of cirrhotic HCC in the training cohort, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 3.650 (95% CI [1.761-7.566]) and log-rank P value of 0.0002. Moreover, this model also showed favorable prognostic significance for RFS in the training set (HR: 2.392, 95% CI [1.374-4.164], log-rank PÂ =Â 0.0015). The predictive performance of the four-lncRNA model for OS and RFS was verified in the testing set. Furthermore, the results of stratified analysis revealed that the four-lncRNA model was an independent factor in the prediction of OS and RFS of patients with clinical characteristics such as TNM (Tumor, Node, Metastasis system) stages I-II, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stages 0-A, and solitary tumors in both the training set and testing set. The results of functional prediction showed that four lncRNAs may be potentially involve in multiple metabolic processes, such as amino acid, lipid, and glucose metabolism in cirrhotic HCC.",2019,PeerJ
Threeâ€dimensional elastic wave velocity structure of the western and central Tien Shan,"Arrival times of compressional (P) and shear (S) waves generated by earthquakes at local and teleseismic distances and recorded by seismographs located in the western and central Tien Shan are used to determine one- and three-dimensional elastic wave velocity structures of the crust and upper mantle beneath the mountain belt. The best fit one-dimensional structures suggest that the average depth of the Mohorovicic discontinuity in this area is 50 km. The three-dimensional structure of the upper crust reveals thick sediments within each of the major depressions in the region. A 7 km-thick wedge of sediment beneath the Chu Depression is outlined at depth by a south dipping plane of seismic activity, suggesting the presence of an active decollemont. These low velocities extend continuously to the southeast toward Issyk-Kul, suggesting a structural relationship between the two. However, rather than being consumed, it appears that Issyk-Kul is overthrusting the surrounding ranges. The low-velocity sediments in the Fergana basin reach depths of 10 km and are bounded on three sides by amorphous bands of seismicity. Velocities at midcrustal depths generally are lower beneath the central Tien Shan than beneath the western Tien Shan. This pattern becomes more evident in the uppermost mantle, with P velocity contrasts of as much as 10% across a boundary that corresponds roughly to the geographical position of the Talasso-Fergana fault. The low velocities beneath the central Tien Shan exceed 150 km depth but do not appear to be deeper than 300 km depth. There is no evidence for a lithospheric root beneath this part of the range; rather, the low velocities imply the presence of a positive buoyancy force uplifting the mountains. Evidence that this low-velocity region existed before the collision suggests that the Tien Shan may not owe its rejuvenation simply to its location at the northern edge of a strong Tarim basin but rather to an anomalous upper mantle that was easier to deform than the surrounding lithosphere.",1993,Journal of Geophysical Research
"Widows, Sons, and Old-Age Security in Rural Maharashtra: A Comment on Vlassoff","Carol Vlassoff has taken issue with me on a number of points in a recent article in this journal.' Vlassoff wishes to argue that sons in South India (and, in all likelihood, in South Asia more generally) are not of great value or importance as sources of security to their parents, be they elderly and/or widowed; and, therefore, reproductive decisions are uninfluenced by security concerns or the expectation that security needs in old age or otherwise will be taken care of by sons (or, for that matter, by daughters). I am assigned the opposing view: that sons are important sources of security for elderly parents and that concerns about old-age security inform fertility decisions. (I accept Vlassoff's attribution in the first case - that sons are an important source of security - but would demur in the case of fertility motivations. I do believe that security concerns motivate fertility decisions, but neither I nor anyone else have provided much evidence on motivations, nor have I claimed to provide such evidence.) By considering the circumstances of a sample of widows from a village in Satara District in Maharashtra, India, and the extent to which they rely on sons for support, Vlassoff hopes to provide support for her argument. Primarily through case-study material which describes the circumstances of widows in this village, but also by comparing the incomes of widows with different living arrangements, Vlassoff claims broad support for her argument. A close reading of her evidence, however, suggests a very different conclusion. On the basis of the material presented by Vlassoff, one can say very little, one way or another, about the role of sons in this setting (or any other setting in South Asia) as a source of old-age security; certainly, nothing in the article would lead one to believe that in the vast majority of cases sons do not care for their aged or infirm parents. Furthermore, the data presented in the article have no bearing at all on the criteria for reproductive decisions and, therefore, Vlassoff has no basis for commenting on the salience of security concerns for such decisions.",1991,Population Studies-a Journal of Demography
HIV among Female Sex Workers in Five Cities in Burkina Faso: A Cross-Sectional Baseline Survey to Inform HIV/AIDS Programs,"Background
Female sex workers (FSWs) are considered a vulnerable population for HIV infection and a priority for HIV/AIDS response programs. This study aimed to determine HIV prevalence among FSWs in five cities in Burkina Faso.


Methods
FSWs aged 18 and older were recruited using respondent driven sampling (RDS) in five cities (Ouagadougou, Bobo-Dioulasso, Koudougou, Ouahigouya, and Tenkodogo) in Burkina Faso from 2013 to 2014. HIV testing was performed using the HIV testing national algorithm. We conducted bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis to assess correlates of HIV in all cities combined (not RDS-adjusted).


Results
Among Ouagadougou, Koudougou, and Ouahigouya FSWs, RDS-adjusted HIV prevalence was 13.5% (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 9.6-18.7), 13.3% (95% CI: 7.6-22.4), and 13.0% (95% CI: 7.6-21.3), respectively, compared to 30.1% (95% CI: 25.5-35.1) among Bobo-Dioulasso FSWs. Factors associated with HIV infection were age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 7.84 95% CI: 3.78-16.20), being married or cohabitating (aOR = 2.43, 95% CI: 1.31-4.49), and history of pregnancy (aOR = 5.24, 95% CI: 1.44-18.97).


Conclusion
These results highlight the need to strengthen HIV prevention among FSWs, through behavior change strategies, and improve access to sexual and reproductive health services.",2017,AIDS Research and Treatment
Un exemple de civilisation de ports-entrepÃ´ts des Mers du Sud : le Sud Kedah (Malaysia) Ve-XIVe siÃ¨cles,"The civilization of South Kedah (Malaysia) was closely linked, from the 5th to the 14th centuries A.D. to international sea trade between several parts of Asia: China, the Middle East and India. Entrepot ports arose, which were more or less controlled by the Sumatran thalassocracy of Srivijaya. The archaeological remains consist, on the one hand, of large amounts of sherds of ceramic (mostly Chinese), sherds of glass vessels from the Middle East, and beads, and, on the other hand, of the ruins of temples devoted to Buddhism or Hinduism. After the 10th century, these two religions were probably practised together with predominating Hinduism. These temples were the local pragmatic adaptation of classic Indian structures. They are not evidence of an Indian colonization or of a small Indianized Malay state but were only ordered by the Indian traders and built in the neighbourhood of the entrepot ports with the permission of the local Malay potentates. It is very probable that the other communities of foreign merchants also had their temples and their mosques but that these were built with perishable materials.",1992,Arts Asiatiques
Differences in Process Management and In-Hospital Delays in Treatment with iv Thrombolysis,"OBJECTIVES
Rapid initiation of intravenous thrombolysis improves patient's outcome in acute stroke. We analyzed inter-center variability and factors that influence the door-to-needle time with a special focus on process measurements in all Austrian stroke units.


METHODS
Case level data of patients receiving intravenous thrombolysis in the Austrian Stroke Unit Registry were enriched with information of a structured questionnaire on center specific process measures of all Austrian stroke units. Influence of case and center specific variables was determined by LASSO procedure.


RESULTS
Center specific median door-to-needle time ranged between 30 and 78 minutes. Between April 2004 and November 2012, 6246 of 57991 patients treated in Austrian stroke units with acute ischemic stroke received intravenous thrombolysis. An onset-to-door time >120 minutes, patients with total anterior circulation stroke, recent year of admission, patient transportation with ambulance crew and emergency physician, the use of point of care tests reduced the door-to-needle time, whereas onset-to-door â‰¤ 60 minutes, unknown onset-to-door, patients with an NIHSS â‰¤ 4 or posterior circulation stroke, initial admission to a general emergency department, a distant radiology department, primary imaging modality other than plain CT and waiting for the lab results were associated with an increase in door-to-needle time. Case level and center specific factors could explain the inter center variability of door-to-needle times in 31 of 34 stroke units in Austria.


CONCLUSIONS
In light of our results it seems crucial that every single stroke center documents and critically reviews possibilities of optimizing practice strategies in acute stroke care.",2013,PLoS ONE
"POSTER SESSION 2: Thursday, 1 May 2008, 13:30â€“18:00 Location: Poster Area","R Mitsutake; S Miura; B Zhang; K Saku Fukuoka University Hospital Cardiology, Fukuoka, Japan Background: A relationship has been noted between lower levels of HDL-associated phospholipid and atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD). The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between numerous lipidemic factors and severity of CAD as evaluated by multi-detector row computed tomography (MDCT). Methods and Results: Subjects included 195 consecutive patients who underwent coronary angiography using MDCT because of suspected CAD. Coronary artery calcification (CAC) score and Gensiniâ€™s score (GS) as evaluated by MDCT, platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH), free cholesterol (FC), phospholipid (PL), remnant-like lipoprotein particle-cholesterol (RLP-C), apolipoprotein (apo)-C, apo-B, apo-C3, apo-E, highly-sensitive CRP were determined. The number of the significant coronary vessel disease (VD) was determined using MDCT. The number of VD was significantly associated with HDL-C, HDL-associated HDL-C, HDL-associated PL, HDL-associated FC and RLP-C. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the number of VD was most closely correlated with HDL-C levels (p=0.02). GS was significantly associated with age, HDL cholesterol, hemoglobin A1c, HDLassociated PAF-AH, HDL-associated FC and HDL-associated phospholipid. Multivariate analysis revealed that GS was most closely correlated with HDL-associated phospholipid (p=0.02). Conclusion: Lower levels of HDL-associated phospholipid may be an indicator and provide additional information regarding the severity of CAD compared with other lipidemic factors.",2008,European Journal of Cardiovascular Prevention & Rehabilitation

Steric complementarity directs sequence promiscuous leader binding in RiPP biosynthesis.,"Enzymes that generate ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptide (RiPP) natural products have garnered significant interest, given their ability to produce large libraries of chemically diverse scaffolds. Such RiPP biosynthetic enzymes are predicted to bind their corresponding peptide substrates through sequence-specific recognition of the leader sequence, which is removed after the installation of posttranslational modifications on the core sequence. The conservation of the leader sequence within a given RiPP class, in otherwise disparate precursor peptides, further supports the notion that strict sequence specificity is necessary for leader peptide engagement. Here, we demonstrate that leader binding by a biosynthetic enzyme in the lasso peptide class of RiPPs is directed by a minimal number of hydrophobic interactions. Biochemical and structural data illustrate how a single leader-binding domain can engage sequence-divergent leader peptides using a conserved motif that facilitates hydrophobic packing. The presence of this simple motif in noncognate peptides results in low micromolar affinity binding by binding domains from several different lasso biosynthetic systems. We also demonstrate that these observations likely extend to other RiPP biosynthetic classes. The portability of the binding motif opens avenues for the engineering of semisynthetic hybrid RiPP products.",2019,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
Robotic single-site plus ONE port distal pancreatectomy,"Abstract
Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy is regarded as safe and effective surgical approach in benign and low-grade malignant tumor of the pancreas. With the advances of laparoscopic techniques and instruments, many efforts to reduce the number of the trocar site has been made. There are a few available surgical techniques of laparoscopic single-site (single port or reduced port) distal pancreatectomy, suggesting its safety and feasibility. However, it is true that laparoscopic single-site distal pancreatectomy is difficult and technically quite demanding. Robotic surgical system was introduced to overcome the limitation of conventional laparoscopic surgery. Recently, we experienced robotic single-site plus ONE port distal pancreatectomy in benign and low-grade malignant tumor of the pancreas. A 45-year-old male patient was incidentally found to have pancreatic mass in tail of the pancreas. October 6th 2015, robotic distal pancreatectomy was performed using the Da Vinci single-site surgical platform (DVSSP) with one additional port. Additional robotic 12-mm-port was placed left side of DVSSP, and robotic 3rd arm was used through this site. Usual robotic instruments such as hook, bipolar, vessel sealer, and endo-GIA with endo-wrist function could be used to facilitate effective surgical procedure. The general operation procedure was based on modified Lasso technique (isolation and ligation of splenic artery prior to Lasso technique). Resected specimen was delivered through umbilicus and drains were inserted through additional port site. Five consecutive clinical experiences were reviewed. This study was approved by institutional review board. Two patients were male and three were female with median age, 38 years (range 21â€“56). The distribution of the pathological diagnosis was 2 solid pseudopapillary tumors, 1 serous cystic neoplasm, 1 chronic pancreatitis, and 1 neuroendocrine tumor. Median operation time was 165Â min (range 120â€“270Â min), and intraoperative-estimated blood loss were median 5Â ml (range 0â€“50Â ml). One patient could preserve spleen by Warshaw procedure. One patient converted to conventional multi-port robotic distal pancreatectomy due to inter-arms collisions. There was no clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula. Length of hospital stay was median 6 days after surgery (range 5â€“8Â days). Robotic single-site plus ONE port distal pancreatectomy is safe and feasible with acceptable perioperative outcomes. Although, certain patients such as those with a hard pancreas need an amount of care due to the features of robotic GIA, currently available robotic single-site plus ONE port surgical system was thought to have potential role to make laparoscopic single-site distal pancreatectomy much easier and ergonomics, providing some room to expand more minimally invasive surgery. Further experiences are mandatory.",2017,Surgical Endoscopy
Prediction of maize phenotype based on whole-genome single nucleotide polymorphisms using deep belief networks,"Selection in plant breeding could be more effective and more efficient if it is based on genomic data. Genomic selection (GS) is a new approach for plant-breeding selection that exploits genomic data through a mechanism called genomic prediction (GP). Most of GP models used linear methods that ignore effects of interaction among genes and effects of higher order nonlinearities. Deep belief network (DBN), one of the architectural in deep learning methods, is able to model data in high level of abstraction that involves nonlinearities effects of the data. This study implemented DBN for developing a GP model utilizing whole-genome Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) as data for training and testing. The case study was a set of traits in maize. The maize dataset was acquisitioned from CIMMYT's (International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center) Global Maize program. Based on Pearson correlation, DBN is outperformed than other methods, kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) regression, Bayesian LASSO (BL), best linear unbiased predictor (BLUP), in case allegedly non-additive traits. DBN achieves correlation of 0.579 within -1 to 1 range.",2017,
FrÃ¼he Schritte der Enten Hepatitis B Virus Infektion : Zellassoziation und intrazellulÃ¤re Degradation als Hauptdeterminanten der Infektionseffizienz in vivo und in vitro,"Die fruhen Schritte einer Infektion, d.h. Anheftung der Viren an und Aufnahme in die Zelle, sind entscheidend fur die hohe Wirts- und Gewebsspezifitat der Hepatitis B Viren und somit den Erfolg der Infektion. Diese sind aber bisher auf molekularer Ebene nur unzureichend verstanden. Eine Ursache hierfur ist die ineffiziente Infektion primarer Hepatozyten, die im Gegensatz zu der auserst effizienten Infektion in vivo steht. Um sich Einblicke in die Unterschiede der beiden Systeme zu verschaffen, wurde in dieser Arbeit am Tiermodell des Enten Hepatitis B Virus (DHBV) erstmals quantitativ die in vivo Infektion der Pekingente mit der in vitro Infektion primarer Entenhepatozyten verglichen. Die Ergebnisse zeigten, dass die Anheftung der Viren in der Leber in vivo im Gegensatz zu in vitro schnell und auserst effizient erfolgt. Dieser Unterschied konnte auf dem aktiven Transport der Viren durch den Blutstrom in die Leber und auf der hoheren Konzentration der Viren in der Leber beruhen. Ein weiterer Unterschied der beiden Systeme zeigte sich vermutlich bedingt durch den Zustand der Zellen im Verlauf der produktiven Primarinfektion, die in vivo bereits nach einem, in vitro erst nach drei Tagen detektierbar war. Nach der Aufnahme der Viren in die Zellen wurde in beiden Infektionssystemen aufgrund eines intrinsischen Abwehrmechanismus ein groser Teil der Viren abgebaut. Von den persistierenden Viren fuhrte mindestens jedes zehnte zu einer Infektion, was zeigt, dass die Viruspartikel im Gegensatz zu vielen anderen Viren hoch infektios sind. Die Ausbreitung der Infektion erfolgte in beiden Systemen synchron und bevorzugt auf die umliegenden Zellen. Dies lasst sich durch die lokal erhohte Konzentration der Nachkommenviren erklaren, zusatzlich in vivo begunstigt durch die dreidimensionale Struktur der Leber. Die Suche nach weiteren stimulierenden Faktoren fuhrte zu der Beobachtung, dass Hepatozyten in der Umgebung von Zellen, die das virale Hullprotein exprimierten, vermehrt infiziert wurden. Um den Eintrittsmechanismus der Viren in die Zelle aufzuklaren, wurde im zweiten Teil der Arbeit eine detaillierte in vitro Analyse der Zellassoziation der Viren und der nachfolgenden Schritte durchgefuhrt. Folgende Erkenntnisse konnten erlangt werden: Die Bindung und Infektion von DHBV ist konzentrations- und zeitabhangig und wird nicht durch eine Sattigung des primaren Rezeptors limitiert. Uberexpression des zellularen Interaktionspartners Carboxypeptidase D in Hepatozyten zeigte, dass dieser Faktor die Primarbindung der Viren an die Zellen nicht limitiert. Die Inokulation von Viren bei tiefen Temperaturen fuhrte zu einer drastischen Reduktion der Infektion, wahrend die Zellassoziation weitgehend unbeeinflusst blieb. Dies zeigt, dass die im Fall von DHBV beobachtete Bindung der Viren bei tiefen Temperaturen, wie sie bei vielen anderen Viren durchgefuhrt wird, um die Zellassoziation und Infektion zu synchronisieren, nicht die produktive Bindung reflektiert. Mit Hilfe replikationsdefizienter rekombinanter Viren wurden die Schritte der produktiv werdenden Viruspartikel verfolgt, woraus ein mehrstufiges Modell abgeleitet werden konnte. Eingangs erfolgt eine reversible Bindung der Viren an die Zelloberflache, die sensitiv gegenuber neutralisierenden Antikorpern ist. Die anschliesende energieabhangige, irreversible Bindung ist Antikorper-resistent, jedoch noch Saure-sensitiv und erfolgt nicht bei niedriger Temperatur. Die Internalisierung der Viren zu einem dritten, Saure-resistenten, Zustand vollzieht sich sehr langsam. Insgesamt zeigen die Ergebnisse, dass die wesentlichen Unterschiede der DHBV-Infektion in vivo und in vitro nur vor, aber nicht nach der Zellassoziation liegen. Die Infektion begleitende Degradation von Viruspartikeln in Leberzellen stellt eine wesentliche Determinante der Infektionseffizienz von Hepadnaviren dar, die in vivo und in vitro in gleichem Mase erfolgt. Diese Verteidigungsstrategie des Organismus wird jedoch durch die effiziente Ausbreitung der Infektion erfolgreich umgangen.",2006,
Error estimation for surrogate models of dynamical systems using machine learning,"This work proposes a machine-learning-based framework for estimating the error introduced by surrogate models of parameterized dynamical systems. The framework applies high-dimensional regression techniques (e.g., random forests, LASSO) to map a large set of inexpensively-computed 'error indicators' (i.e., features) produced by the surrogate model at a given time instance to a prediction of the surrogate-model error in a quantity of interest (QoI). The methodology requires a training set of parameter instances at which the time-dependent surrogate-model error is computed by simulating both the high-fidelity and surrogate models. Using these training data, the method first performs feature-space partitioning (via classification or clustering), and subsequently constructs a 'local' regression model to predict the time-instantaneous error within each identified region of feature space. We consider two uses for the resulting error model: (1) as a correction to the surrogate-model QoI prediction at each time instance, and (2) as a way to statistically model arbitrary functions of the time-dependent surrogate-model error (e.g., time-integrated errors). We apply the proposed framework to a nonlinear oil-water problem with time-varying well-control (bottom-hole pressure) parameters, and consider proper orthogonal decomposition applied with trajectory piecewise linearization (POD-TPWL) as the surrogate model. When the first use of the method is considered, numerical experiments demonstrate that the method consistently improves accuracy in the time-instantaneous QoI prediction relative to the original surrogate model across a large number of test cases. When the second use is considered, numerical experiments show that the proposed method generates accurate, unbiased statistical predictions of the time- and well-averaged errors.",2017,ArXiv
Predicting qualitative phenotypes from microarray data â€“ the Eadgene pig data set,"BackgroundThe aim of this work was to study the performances of 2 predictive statistical tools on a data set that was given to all participants of the Eadgene-SABRE Post Analyses Working Group, namely the Pig data set of Hazard et al.

The objective was to find biomarkers that characterized the genotypes and the treatments in the whole set of genes.MethodsWe first considered the Random Forest approach that enables the selection of predictive variables. We then compared the classical Partial Least Squares regression (PLS) with a novel approach called sparse PLS, a variant of PLS that adapts lasso penalization and allows for the selection of a subset of variables.ResultsAll methods performed well on this data set. The sparse PLS outperformed the PLS in terms of prediction performance and improved the interpretability of the results.ConclusionWe recommend the use of machine learning methods such as Random Forest and multivariate methods such as sparse PLS for prediction purposes. Both approaches are well adapted to transcriptomic data where the number of features is much greater than the number of individuals.",2009,BMC Proceedings

Stratigraphy and Palynology of the Upper Triassic Nayband Formation of East-central Iran,"A palynological study of the Nayband Formation (central eastern Iran) has been carried out in order to review and update its stratigraphic framework. In its type locality the formation crops out on the southern flank of Nayband Mountain, about 200 km south of Tabas. It consists of a thick, mixed siliciclastic-carbonate sequence subdivided into four members; in ascending order: the Gelkan Member (mainly shales and silstones), the Bidestan Member (marls, siltstones with minor sandstones and fossiliferous limestones), the Howz-e-Sheikh Member (sandstones and siltstones), and the Howz-e-Khan Member (sponge and coral dominated reefs alternating with marls and sandstones). Three palynological assemblages have been recognised; in ascending order: a) an assemblage characterised by the presence of Annulispora folliculosa and A. microannulata which allows the Gelkan Member and most of the Bidestan Member to be assigned an early Norian age; (b) an assemblage marked by the first occurrence of Polycingulatisporites mooniensis, which indicates the upper part of the Bidestan Member is mid-late Norian; c) an assemblage containing Classopollis chateaunovi in association with Retitriletes austroclavatidites, Gliscopollis meyeriana, Limbosporites lundbladii, Rugaletes awakinoensis and Callialasporites dampieri that allows the Howz-e-Sheikh Member to be assigned a Rhaetian age.

Recovery of sign vectors in quadratic compressed sensing,"In certain applications, recovering the signs of values may be more critical than the values themselves. Inspired by advances of sparse recovery of signals with fewer measurements, we would like to study the sign recovery problem and generalize it from a linear case to a non-linear setup. We focus on the sign values in quadratic measurement systems and provide theorems for the consistency condition, which ensures the signs are recovered correctly with probability close to 1. In deriving the consistency condition, we adopt a new penalty term using the trace operation and transform the optimization problem to the widely known Lasso problem. We also present simulation results to verify the correctness of our theorems.",2017,2017 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW)

Difference of two norms-regularizations for Q-Lasso,"Abstract The focus of this paper is in Q-Lasso introduced in Alghamdi et al. (2013) which extended the Lasso by Tibshirani (1996). The closed convex subset Q belonging in a Euclidean m-space, for m âˆˆ IN âˆ— , is the set of errors when linear measurements are taken to recover a signal/image via the Lasso. Based on a recent work by Wang (2013), we are interested in two new penalty methods for Q-Lasso relying on two types of difference of convex functions (DC for short) programming where the DC objective functions are the difference of l 1 and l Ïƒ q norms and the difference of l 1 and l r norms with r > 1 . By means of a generalized q-term shrinkage operator upon the special structure of l Ïƒ q norm, we design a proximal gradient algorithm for handling the DC l 1 - l Ïƒ q model. Then, based on the majorization scheme, we develop a majorized penalty algorithm for the DC l 1 - l r model. The convergence results of our new algorithms are presented as well. We would like to emphasize that extensive simulation results in the case Q = { b } show that these two new algorithms offer improved signal recovery performance and require reduced computational effort relative to state-of-the-art l 1 and l p ( p âˆˆ ( 0 , 1 ) ) models, see Wang (2013). We also devise two DC Algorithms on the spirit of a paper where exact DC representation of the cardinality constraint is investigated and which also used the largest-q norm of l Ïƒ q and presented numerical results that show the efficiency of our DC Algorithm in comparison with other methods using other penalty terms in the context of quadratic programing, see Jun-ya et al. (2017).",2018,Applied Computing and Informatics
Standardization and the Group Lasso Penalty.,"We re-examine the original Group Lasso paper of Yuan and Lin (2007). The form of penalty in that paper seems to be designed for problems with uncorrelated features, but the statistical community has adopted it for general problems with correlated features. We show that for this general situation, a Group Lasso with a different choice of penalty matrix is generally more effective. We give insight into this formulation and show that it is intimately related to the uniformly most powerful invariant test for inclusion of a group. We demonstrate the efficacy of this method- the ""standardized Group Lasso""- over the usual group lasso on real and simulated data sets. We also extend this to the Ridged Group Lasso to provide within group regularization as needed. We discuss a simple algorithm based on group-wise coordinate descent to fit both this standardized Group Lasso and Ridged Group Lasso.",2012,Statistica Sinica
Proteases in the Treatment of Cancer Emerging Potential of Therapeutic Targeting of Ubiquitin-Specific,"Abstract The ubiquitinâ€“proteasome system (UPS) has emerged as a therapeutic focus and target for the treatmentof cancer. The most clinically successful UPS-active agents (bortezomib and lenalidomide) are limited inapplication to hematologic malignancies, with only marginal efï¬cacy in solid tumors. Inhibition of speciï¬cubiquitin E3 ligases has also emerged as a valid therapeutic strategy, and many targets are currently beinginvestigated. Another emerging and promising approach in regulation of the UPS involves targetingdeubiquitinases (DUB). The DUBs comprise a relatively small group of proteins, most with cysteine proteaseactivity that target several key proteins involved in regulation of tumorigenesis, apoptosis, senescence, andautophagy. Through their multiple contacts with ubiquitinated protein substrates involved in these path-ways, DUBs provide an untapped means of modulating many important regulatory proteins that supportoncogenic transformation and progression. Ubiquitin-speciï¬cproteases(USP)areoneclassofDUBsthathave drawn special attention as cancer targets, as many are differentially expressed or activated in tumors ortheir microenvironment, making them ideal candidates for drug development. This review attempts tosummarize the USPs implicated in different cancers, the current status of USP inhibitorâ€“mediatedpharmacologic intervention, and future prospects for USP inhibitors to treat diverse cancers.Cancer Res;74(18); 4955â€“66. 2014 AACR.",2014,
High-dimensional Cox models: the choice of penalty as part of the model building process.,"The Cox proportional hazards regression model is the most popular approach to model covariate information for survival times. In this context, the development of high-dimensional models where the number of covariates is much larger than the number of observations (p>>n) is an ongoing challenge. A practicable approach is to use ridge penalized Cox regression in such situations. Beside focussing on finding the best prediction rule, one is often interested in determining a subset of covariates that are the most important ones for prognosis. This could be a gene set in the biostatistical analysis of microarray data. Covariate selection can then, for example, be done by L(1)-penalized Cox regression using the lasso (Tibshirani (1997). Statistics in Medicine 16, 385-395). Several approaches beyond the lasso, that incorporate covariate selection, have been developed in recent years. This includes modifications of the lasso as well as nonconvex variants such as smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) (Fan and Li (2001). Journal of the American Statistical Association 96, 1348-1360; Fan and Li (2002). The Annals of Statistics 30, 74-99). The purpose of this article is to implement them practically into the model building process when analyzing high-dimensional data with the Cox proportional hazards model. To evaluate penalized regression models beyond the lasso, we included SCAD variants and the adaptive lasso (Zou (2006). Journal of the American Statistical Association 101, 1418-1429). We compare them with ""standard"" applications such as ridge regression, the lasso, and the elastic net. Predictive accuracy, features of variable selection, and estimation bias will be studied to assess the practical use of these methods. We observed that the performance of SCAD and adaptive lasso is highly dependent on nontrivial preselection procedures. A practical solution to this problem does not yet exist. Since there is high risk of missing relevant covariates when using SCAD or adaptive lasso applied after an inappropriate initial selection step, we recommend to stay with lasso or the elastic net in actual data applications. But with respect to the promising results for truly sparse models, we see some advantage of SCAD and adaptive lasso, if better preselection procedures would be available. This requires further methodological research.",2010,Biometrical journal. Biometrische Zeitschrift

EM Adaptive LASSOâ€”A Multilocus Modeling Strategy for Detecting SNPs Associated with Zero-inflated Count Phenotypes,"Count data are increasingly ubiquitous in genetic association studies, where it is possible to observe excess zero counts as compared to what is expected based on standard assumptions. For instance, in rheumatology, data are usually collected in multiple joints within a person or multiple sub-regions of a joint, and it is not uncommon that the phenotypes contain enormous number of zeroes due to the presence of excessive zero counts in majority of patients. Most existing statistical methods assume that the count phenotypes follow one of these four distributions with appropriate dispersion-handling mechanisms: Poisson, Zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP), Negative Binomial, and Zero-inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB). However, little is known about their implications in genetic association studies. Also, there is a relative paucity of literature on their usefulness with respect to model misspecification and variable selection. In this article, we have investigated the performance of several state-of-the-art approaches for handling zero-inflated count data along with a novel penalized regression approach with an adaptive LASSO penalty, by simulating data under a variety of disease models and linkage disequilibrium patterns. By taking into account data-adaptive weights in the estimation procedure, the proposed method provides greater flexibility in multi-SNP modeling of zero-inflated count phenotypes. A fast coordinate descent algorithm nested within an EM (expectation-maximization) algorithm is implemented for estimating the model parameters and conducting variable selection simultaneously. Results show that the proposed method has optimal performance in the presence of multicollinearity, as measured by both prediction accuracy and empirical power, which is especially apparent as the sample size increases. Moreover, the Type I error rates become more or less uncontrollable for the competing methods when a model is misspecified, a phenomenon routinely encountered in practice.",2016,Frontiers in Genetics

The Parallelization of the Bayesian Lasso through Apache Spark,"In recent years the use of Bayesian inference for the analysis of statistical models has dramatically increased due to the proliferation of computing power. For most real-world applications, carrying out these Bayesian inferences turn out to be mostly numeric and computationally heavy since analytic forms of these models are mostly unfeasible. This is especially true about high-dimensional, non-linear models, which are mostly analyzed via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques which are known for requiring notorious amounts of computation power. Thus, it is of interest to find ways to parallelize MCMC techniques in order to speed up Bayesian analysis. In 2011, Apache Hadoop revolutionized the way people and companies were storing, processing, and analyzing data. A distributed, parallel, and scalable software framework became the preferred tool of the large-data processing community. In 2014, a new framework called Apache Spark improved on the ideas of Hadoop. Spark made the data-processing step much faster than Hadoop by doing most work in-memory and improving on Hadoopâ€™s MapReduce paradigm. The goal of this project was to build a modular, domainindefinite application programming interface (API) for Spark which will house all Bayesian modeling logic, including the parallelization of the well known MCMC technique known as Gibbs sampling. This project used a Gibbs sampling implementation to implement the method known as Bayesian Lasso. The Bayesian Lasso is a modification of the Lasso proposed by Tibshirani (1996) with a conditional Laplace prior. This project will implement the Bayesian Lasso via Gibbs sampling on Apache Spark. âˆ—Yale University, Double Major in Computer Science and Statistics â€ Yale University Department of Statistics, Lecturer.

News Impact Curves of Volatility for Asymmetric GARCH via LASSO,"The news impact curve(NIC) originally proposed by Engle and Ng (1993) is a graphical representation of volatility for financial time series. The NIC is a simple but a powerful tool for identifying variability of a given time series. It is noted that the NIC is suited to symmetric volatility. Recently a lot of attention has been paid to asymmetric volatility models and therefore asymmetric version of the NIC would be useful in the field of financial time series. In this article, we propose to incorporate LASSO in constructing asymmetric NICs based on asymmetric GARCH models. In particular, bilinear GARCH models are considered and illustrated via KOSDAQ data.",2014,
