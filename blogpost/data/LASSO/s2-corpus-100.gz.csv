A Systematic Approach to Process Data Analytics in Pharmaceutical Manufacturing: The Data Analytics Triangle and Its Application to the Manufacturing of a Monoclonal Antibody,"Abstract This chapter provides a tutorial on the effective application of process data analytics techniques to (bio)pharmaceutical processes. A methodology is proposed in which the process dataset is first interrogated to determine its characteristics in terms of extents of correlation, nonlinearity, and dynamics. The second step is select effective data analytics techniques based on the combination of the identified characteristics. Techniques can be read from a â€œdata analytics triangle,â€ which has the characteristics at its vertices. This chapter also discusses the value of sparse models and the importance of thorough cross-validation when applying data analytics techniques to (bio)pharmaceutical data sets. Key points and data analytic techniques including lasso and elastic net are described and demonstrated within the context of their application to laboratory- and production-scale data for the manufacture of a monoclonal antibody. A case study illustrates best practices for learning from process data, namely, the importance of maintaining plant-wide connections in the data, implementing procedures to counteract overfitting of the models, and the potential for sparse models in (bio)pharmaceutical operations.",2018,
Chapter 2 Staphylococcus epidermidis in Biomaterial-Associated Infections,"T.F. Moriarty et al. (eds.), Biomaterials Associated Infection: Immunological Aspects and Antimicrobial Strategies, DOI 10.1007/978-1-4614-1031-7_2, Â© Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013 Abstract Coagulase-negative staphylococci, mainly Staphylococcus epidermidis , are currently the most frequent cause of hospital acquired infections in the USA. Mostly, but not exclusively, S. epidermidis infections are linked to the use of implanted medical devices like central venous catheters, prosthetic joints and heart valves, pacemakers, cardiac assist devices, cerebrospinal fl uid shunts, and intraocular lenses. As new molecular techniques reveal that S. epidermidis are by no means the most prominent bacteria of the skin and mucous membrane fl ora, the implication is that S. epidermidis has speci fi c virulence factors, which transforms this commensal bacterial species into one of the most successful pathogens in modern medicine. A vast array of speci fi c attachment factors for native and host proteinmodi fi ed device surfaces and the ability to accumulate in adherent multilayered bio fi lms appear to be vital for the success of S. epidermidis as a pathogen. Bio fi lm formation contributes to the ability of the organism to withstand the hostâ€™s innate and acquired immune defense mechanisms and to resist antimicrobial therapy, so that device removal is a regular feature for the treatment of S. epidermidis biomaterialassociated infection. Recent developments in the understanding of S. epidermidis virulence are reviewed in this chapter. Chapter 2 Staphylococcus epidermidis in Biomaterial-Associated Infections",2017,
Efficient Feature Group Sequencing for Anytime Linear Prediction,"We consider \textit{anytime} linear prediction in the common machine learning setting, where features are in groups that have costs. We achieve anytime (or interruptible) predictions by sequencing the computation of feature groups and reporting results using the computed features at interruption. We extend Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) and Forward Regression (FR) to learn the sequencing greedily under this group setting with costs. We theoretically guarantee that our algorithms achieve near-optimal linear predictions at each budget when a feature group is chosen. With a novel analysis of OMP, we improve its theoretical bound to the same strength as that of FR. In addition, we develop a novel algorithm that consumes cost $4B$ to approximate the optimal performance of \textit{any} cost $B$, and prove that with cost less than $4B$, such an approximation is impossible. To our knowledge, these are the first anytime bounds at \textit{all} budgets. We test our algorithms on two real-world data-sets and evaluate them in terms of anytime linear prediction performance against cost-weighted Group Lasso and alternative greedy algorithms.",2016,ArXiv
Sequential multiple testing for variable selection in high dimensional linear model,"Author(s): Chen, Hailu | Advisor(s): Cui, Xinping | Abstract: Covariance test is proposed for testing the significance of the predictor variable that enters the current lasso model along the lasso solution path. In this paper, we propose the sequential multiple testing structure using covariance test p-values, which has good power properties with error rate controlled at a desired level. Specifically, we consider the full underlying hypotheses and the error rate control within each step as well as across all steps along the lasso solution path. Our sequential multiple hypothesis structure becomes valid because of the asymptotic distribution of the covariance test. And we prove that the minimum composite p-values under null hypothesis get larger along the steps, which is desirable when we apply step-down procedure for error rate control. The benefit of making use of the multivariate structure is, for some scenarios, to increase power while other procedures stop the selection too early. Also, our Hybrid procedures show higher power through simulations for weak signals and for high-dimensional data.To control FWER, we propose Hybrid Bonferroni-Holm Step-Down procedure along with Hybrid Hochberg-Holm and Hybrid Simes-Holm Step-Down procedures and compare them with StrongStop. To control FDR, we propose Hybrid Bonferroni-Benjamini-Liu Step-Down procedure and compare it with the ForwardStop, StrongStop, TailStop procedures and SLOPE . Simulation studies show that our proposed procedures have higher power with both FWER and FDR controlled at the desired level, especially for large scale and high-dimensional data, and very stable to use as well as in correlated design matrix.In our work, we first review the variable selection in statistics and most popular used variable selection methods. One of the most widely used and well developed method lasso is introduced in Chapter 2. The covariance test proposed for the significance test for lasso will be given in Chapter 3 , as well as its properties for orthogonal matrix X, and the asymptotic distribution. We then propose our sequential hypotheses multiple testing structure built on the lasso covariance test in Chapter 4. In Chapter 5, we develop the Hybrid Bonferroni-Holm Step-Down procedure to control FWER at alpha, and compare with StrongStop. In Chapter 6, we propose Hybrid Bonferroni-Benjamini-Liu Step-Down method and prove the FDR can be controlled at q. We also compare it with ForwardStop, StrongStop, TailStop and SLOPE through simulation studies. In Chapter 7, we show two applications of our proposed procedure on a diabetes data and a framingham heart study data and compare it with the other procedures. The conclusion and discussion are given in the last. The proofs for the main theorems and lemmas are included in the appendix.",2016,
Urban distribution grid topology reconstruction via Lasso,"The growing integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) in urban areas raises various reliability issues. To ensure robust distribution grid operation, grid monitoring tools are needed, where the topology reconstruction serves as the first step. However, the topology reconstruction is hard in distribution grid. This is because 1) the branches are difficult and expensive to monitor since most of them are underground in urban areas; and 2) the assumption of radial topology in many studies is inappropriate for meshed urban grids. To address these drawbacks, we propose a new data-driven approach to reconstruct distribution grid topology by utilizing the newly available smart meter data. Specifically, a graphical model is built to model the probabilistic relationships among different voltage measurements. With proof, the topology reconstruction problem is formulated as a regularized linear regression problem (Lasso) to deal with meshed network structures. Simulation results show highly accurate estimation in IEEE standard distribution test systems with and without loops using real smart meter data.",2016,2016 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting (PESGM)
Bayesian Hyperparameter Optimization for Machine Learning Based eQTL Analysis,"Machine learning methods are being applied to a wide range of problems in biology and bioinformatics. These methods often rely on configuring high level parameters, or hyperparameters, such as regularization hyperparameters in sparse learning models like graph-guided multitask Lasso methods. Different choices for these hyperparameters will lead to different results, which makes finding good hyperparameter combinations an important task when using these hyperparameter dependent methods. There are several different ways to tune hyperparameters including manual tuning, grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization. In this paper, we apply three hyperparameter tuning strategies to eQTL analysis including grid and random search in addition to Bayesian optimization. Experiments show that the Bayesian optimization strategy outperforms the other strategies in modeling eQTL associations. Applying this strategy to assess eQTL associations using the 1000 Genomes structural variation genotypes and RNAseq data in gEUVADIS, we identify a set of new SVs associated with gene expression changes in a human population.",2017,"Proceedings of the 8th ACM International Conference on Bioinformatics, Computational Biology,and Health Informatics"
Ã‰tude des marqueurs sÃ©rologiques des hÃ©patites virales B et C chez les drÃ©panocytaires suivis en pÃ©diatrie au CHU de Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina Faso),"RÃ©sumÃ©Le but de ce travail Ã©tait de rechercher et de quantifier les marqueurs sÃ©rologiques des hÃ©patites virales B et C chez des enfants drÃ©panocytaires. Une Ã©tude transversale descriptive sâ€™est dÃ©roulÃ©e de juillet Ã  novembre 2014 dans le dÃ©partement de pÃ©diatrie du CHU de Bobo-Dioulasso. Quarante-quatre drÃ©panocytaires SS et 26 SC ont Ã©tÃ© inclus dans lâ€™Ã©tude. Des donnÃ©es gÃ©nÃ©rales et des donnÃ©es mÃ©dicales ont Ã©tÃ© recueillies.

Les patients Ã©taient Ã¢gÃ©s en moyenne de 7,98 ans. Dix-sept patients (dont 13 SS et 4 SC) avaient dÃ©jÃ  Ã©tÃ© transfusÃ©s au moins une fois. Le taux de transfusion Ã©tait significativement plus important parmi les SS que parmi les SC (respectivement : 29,5 % et 15,3 %). Aucun patient nâ€™Ã©tait porteur de lâ€™AgHBs.

Burkina Faso is a high endemic area for hepatitis B. Patients with sickle cell disease are at risk. The aim of this study was to investigate and quantify the serological markers of viral hepatitis B and C among pediatric patients with sickle cell disease. This was a descriptive cross-sectional study, which took place from July to November 2014 at the Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital of Bobo- Dioulasso. The study included 44 SS and 26 SC sickle cell patients. General data (age, gender) and medical information (vaccinations, medical history including transfusion) were collected. Blood samples were taken for research and titration of serological markers of hepatitis viruses B and C with a commercial Elisa test on the ARCHITECT i1000Â® automat of Abbott Laboratories. The mean age of the patients was 7.98 years. Seventeen patients (13 SS and SC 4) had already been transfused at least once. The transfusion rate was significantly higher among the SS patients than among SC (29.5% and 15.3% respectively) patients. No patient with HBs Ag was been found. In two patients, the anti-HBc Ab was found alone. In 33% of cases, no markers of hepatitis B were found. Less than 20% of children fully vaccinated (N = 45) had a protective level of anti-HBs Ab (greater than 10 IU/l). The prevalence of anti-VHC Ab was 2.8%. No case of HBVâ€“HCV co-infection was found. The prevention of infection is an important part of the management of sickle cell patients. Immunization against hepatitis B should be systematic. The results of this study assume that blood safety was good.",2017,Bulletin de la SociÃ©tÃ© de pathologie exotique
Lasso-type estimators for non-parametric mixed-effects models: application to high-dimensional data from a vaccine clinical trial for HIV,"The penalization of likelihoods by L1â€“norms has become a relatively standard technique for highdimensional data when the assumed models are based on n independent and identically distributed observations. These techniques should improve prediction accuracy (since regularization leads to variance reduction) together with interpretability (since sparsity identifies a subset of variables with strong effects). Computationally, these penalties are attractive and their theoretical properties have been intensively studied during the last years. 
Several authors have recently suggested analyzing high-dimensional clustered or longitudinal data using L1â€“penalization methods in mixed effects models. These approaches are mostly developed for variable selection purposes in linear and generalized linear mixed effects models and also, but less extensive, in parametric nonlinear mixed effects models. Only a few works have considered the problem of selecting nonlinear functions using L1â€“penalization methods in nonparametric mixed effects models, with additive or nonadditive predictors. Nonlinear functions are approximated by a linear combination of smooth functions (spline, wavelet or Fourier basis functions) possibly combined with more irregular functions (spiky basis functions). The resulting estimator depends only on a relatively small number of variables and/or 
a relatively small number of basis functions [1]. 
In this study we illustrate the interest of such approaches in the analysis of the DALIA-1 longitudinal trial [2]. Eighteen HIV infected patients received vaccine injections at weeks 0, 4, 8 and 12. Antiretroviral treatment was interrupted at week 24. The patients were followed up to week 48, leading to 14 repeated measures per subject. Our aim was to predict the evolution of viral loads (continuous response) from the about 260 gene sets (predictors). The incorporation of the temporal effect is a key point to reach accurate predictions.

Characterization and machine learning prediction of allele-specific DNA methylation.,"A large collection of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) has been identified in the human genome. Currently, the epigenetic influences of SNPs on their neighboring CpG sites remain elusive. A growing body of evidence suggests that locus-specific information, including genomic features and local epigenetic state, may play important roles in the epigenetic readout of SNPs. In this study, we made use of mouse methylomes with known SNPs to develop statistical models for the prediction of SNP associated allele-specific DNA methylation (ASM). ASM has been classified into parent-of-origin dependent ASM (P-ASM) and sequence-dependent ASM (S-ASM), which comprises scattered-S-ASM (sS-ASM) and clustered-S-ASM (cS-ASM). We found that P-ASM and cS-ASM CpG sites are both enriched in CpG rich regions, promoters and exons, while sS-ASM CpG sites are enriched in simple repeat and regions with high frequent SNP occurrence. Using Lasso-grouped Logistic Regression (LGLR), we selected 21 out of 282 genomic and methylation related features that are powerful in distinguishing cS-ASM CpG sites and trained the classifiers with machine learning techniques. Based on 5-fold cross-validation, the logistic regression classifier was found to be the best for cS-ASM prediction with an ACC of 0.77, an AUC of 0.84 and an MCC of 0.54. Lastly, we applied the logistic regression classifier on human brain methylome and predicted 608 genes associated with cS-ASM. Gene ontology term enrichment analysis indicated that these cS-ASM associated genes are significantly enriched in the category coding for transcripts with alternative splicing forms. In summary, this study provided an analytical procedure for cS-ASM prediction and shed new light on the understanding of different types of ASM events.",2015,Genomics

Effect of Spatial Filtering on Characterizing Soil Properties From Imaging Spectrometer Data,"Airborne imaging spectroscopy covering wavelength range of 0.35â€“2.5  $\mu$m can be used to quantify soil textural properties and chemical constituents. In this paper, we evaluate the effects of spatial resolution on the quantification of soil constituents using a lasso  algorithm-based ensemble bootstrapping framework. Airborne visible infrared imaging spectrometer data collected at 7.6Â m resolution over Bird's Point New Madrid (BPNM) floodway in Missouri, USA, is upscaled using a spatial filter to simulate a satellite-based sensor and generate multiple coarser resolution datasets, including the originally proposed 60.8Â m hyperspectral infrared imager like data. The simulated data at multiple spatial resolutions are used in an ensemble lasso algorithm-based modeling framework for developing quantitative prediction models and spatial mapping of the soil constituents. We outline an evaluation framework with a set of metrics that considers the point-scale model performance as well as the consistency of cross-scale spatial predictions. The model results demonstrate that the ensemble quantification method is scalable, and further the model structure indicates the persistence of important spectral features across spatial resolutions. The probability density functions of the constituents over the BPNM landscape show that it is similar for multiple spatial resolutions. Finally, a comparison of the model predictions with statistical central values together with the within pixel variance across fine to coarse resolutions indicate that the model accurately captures the median values of the fine subgrid that the coarse-resolution data is composed of. This study establishes the feasibility for quantifying soil constituents from space-borne hyperspectral sensors.",2017,IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing
A Genomic Classifier for Predicting Clinically Aggressive Luminal Bladder Tumors with Higher Rates of Pathological Upstaging.,"BACKGROUND
Urothelial carcinoma (UC) of the luminal molecular subtype is associated with lower rates of pathological upstaging from clinical stage T1-T2 to non-organ confined (NOC; â‰¥pT3 and/or pN+) disease at radical cystectomy (RC). However, approximately one-third of luminal UC were upstaged to NOC disease, and these patients may be undertreated if neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is withheld. Here, we trained a genomic classifier to predict luminal NOC disease in patients diagnosed with clinically organ confined (OC; cT1/T2) disease.


MATERIALS & METHODS
Specimens from transurethral resected high grade cT1-T2N0M0 UC of the bladder that belonged to the luminal subtype (Seiler 2017) were randomly split into training (n=75) and testing (n=25) sets for the development of a single-sample luminal upstaging classifier (LUC) using lasso/ridge-penalized logistic regression. All patients underwent RC without NAC and the primary endpoint was upstaging to NOC disease. A radical cystectomy and a platinum-treated NAC cohort were used to evaluate the LUC.


RESULTS
Upstaging to NOC disease occurred in 34% of luminal patients. The LUC predicted upstaging in 32/34 cases, with six false positives (AUC 0.96). The sensitivity for detection of luminal pN+ disease was 95% (20/21). Patients with predicted NOC luminal tumors had worse survival than OC luminal tumors (p=0.001). On multivariable analysis, the LUC was a significant predictor of overall survival (OS) after adjusting for clinical variables available at time of transurethral resection. The LUC also predicted OS for aggressive luminal TCGA patients (n=83, p=0.043). In the NAC cohort, the LUC predicted nine upstaging cases, all of which had excellent prognosis.


CONCLUSION
A LUC was developed that distinguishes a subset of cT1-T2N0M0 luminal UC patients who are at high risk of upstaging to NOC at RC and of death. Validation of this model in an independent large patient cohort is necessary to determine how molecular stratification of luminal tumors could be used to guide treatment of these patients.",2020,The Journal of urology
"Untersuchungen zum Export, zur Membranassoziation und AktivitÃ¤t der Phospholipase A PlaB von Legionella pneumophila","L. pneumophila ist ein in wassriger Umgebung vorkommendes Pathogen. Es repliziert intrazellular in

und ist essentiell fur das intrazellulare Wachstum von L. pneumophila u.a. in RAW Makrophagen. In 
dieser Arbeit wurden die Mechanismen zur Sekretion und zur Membranassoziation sowie die Aktivitat, das intrazellulare Wachstum und die Struktur von PlaB untersucht. Mittels BioID-Assays mit massenspektrometrischer Analyse wurden putative bakterielle PlaB-Interaktionspartner im E. coli-Modell

spezifisch ausgewahlten Legionella-Sekretionssystemen wurden auf Aktivitat und Lokalisation von 
PlaB in E. coli, bzw. L. pneumophila gepruft. Insgesamt wurde bei allen Mutanten keine vollstandige 
Hemmung des Transports und der Aktivitat von PlaB gefunden, obwohl es kleinere Effekte gab. Mithilfe eines Koinfektionsassays mit dem L. pneumophila Wildtyp und der plaB-Mutante wurde ein 
Effekt von PlaB auf das intrazellulare Wachstum in A. castellanii gefunden. Das Substratspektrum von 
PlaB wurde durch Aktivitatstest gegen Phosphatidylinositole, die in Zellmembranen vorkommen, ausgeweitet. Zudem wurde eine inhibierende Wirkung durch Zink entdeckt. Zur weiteren Charakterisierung wurde PlaB kristallisiert. In der Kristallstruktur hat das PlaB-Tetramer NAD+/NADH gebunden.

Lasso tree for cancer staging with survival data.,"The tumor-node-metastasis staging system has been the lynchpin of cancer diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis for many years. For meaningful clinical use, an orderly grouping of the T and N categories into a staging system needs to be defined, usually with respect to a time-to-event outcome. This can be reframed as a model selection problem with respect to features arranged on a partially ordered two-way grid, and a penalized regression method is proposed for selecting the optimal grouping. Instead of penalizing the L1-norm of the coefficients like lasso, in order to enforce the stage grouping, we place L1 constraints on the differences between neighboring coefficients. The underlying mechanism is the sparsity-enforcing property of the L1 penalty, which forces some estimated coefficients to be the same and hence leads to stage grouping. Partial ordering constraints is also required as both the T and N categories are ordinal. A series of optimal groupings with different numbers of stages can be obtained by varying the tuning parameter, which gives a tree-like structure offering a visual aid on how the groupings are progressively made. We hence call the proposed method the lasso tree. We illustrate the utility of our method by applying it to the staging of colorectal cancer using survival outcomes. Simulation studies are carried out to examine the finite sample performance of the selection procedure. We demonstrate that the lasso tree is able to give the right grouping with moderate sample size, is stable with regard to changes in the data, and is not affected by random censoring.",2013,Biostatistics
Greedy and Relaxed Approximations to Model Selection : A simulation study,"The Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle is an important tool for retrieving knowledge from data as it embodies the scientific strife for simplicity in describing the relationship among variables. As MDL and other model selection criteria penalize models on their dimensionality, the estimation problem involves a combinatorial search over subsets of predictors and quickly becomes computationally cumbersome. Two approximation frameworks are: convex relaxation and greedy algorithms. In this article, we perform extensive simulations comparing two algorithms for generating candidate models that mimic the best subsets of predictors for given sizes (Forward Stepwise and the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator LASSO). From the list of models determined by each method, we consider estimates chosen by two different model selection criteria (AICc and the generalized MDL criterion gMDL). The comparisons are made in terms of their selection and prediction performances. In terms of variable selection, we consider two different metrics. For the number of selection errors, our results suggest that the combination Forward Stepwise+gMDL has a better performance over different sample sizes and sparsity regimes. For the second metric of rate of true positives among the selected variables, LASSO+gMDL seems more appropriate for very small sample sizes, while Forward Stepwise+gMDL has a better performance for sample sizes at least as large as the number of factors being screened. Moreover, we found that, asymptotically, Zhao and Yuâ€™s ((1)) irrepresentibility condition (index) has a larger impact on the selection performance of Lasso than on Forward Stepwise. In what refers to prediction performance, LASSO+AICc results in good predictive models over a wide range of sample sizes and sparsity regimes. Last but not least, these simulation results reveal that one method often can not serve for both selection and prediction purposes.",2008,
Overlapping Group Logistic Regression with Applications to Genetic Pathway Selection,"Discovering important genes that account for the phenotype of interest has long been a challenge in genome-wide expression analysis. Analyses such as gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) that incorporate pathway information have become widespread in hypothesis testing, but pathway-based approaches have been largely absent from regression methods due to the challenges of dealing with overlapping pathways and the resulting lack of available software. The R package grpreg is widely used to fit group lasso and other group-penalized regression models; in this study, we develop an extension, grpregOverlap, to allow for overlapping group structure using a latent variable approach. We compare this approach to the ordinary lasso and to GSEA using both simulated and real data. We find that incorporation of prior pathway information can substantially improve the accuracy of gene expression classifiers, and we shed light on several ways in which hypothesis-testing approaches such as GSEA differ from regression approaches with respect to the analysis of pathway data.",2016,Cancer Informatics
"Low-dimensional decomposition, smoothing and forecasting of sparse functional data","We propose a new generic method ROPES (Regularized Optimization for Prediction and Estimation with Sparse data) for decomposing, smoothing and forecasting two-dimensional sparse data. In some ways, ROPES is similar to Ridge Regression, the LASSO, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Maximum-Margin Matrix Factorisation (MMMF). Using this new approach, we propose a practical method of forecasting mortality rates, as well as a new method for interpolating and extrapolating sparse longitudinal data. We also show how to calculate prediction intervals for the resulting estimates.",2014,
Least Angle Regression and LASSO for Large Datasets,"Least-Angle Regression and the LASSO (`1-penalized regression) offer a number of advantages in variable selection applications over procedures such as stepwise or ridge regression, including prediction accuracy, stability and interpretability. We discuss formulations of these algorithms that extend to datasets in which the number of observations could be so large that it would not be possible to access the matrix of predictors as a unit in computations. Our methods require a single pass through the data for orthogonal transformation, effectively reducing the dimension of the computations required to obtain the regression coefficients and residual sums-of-squares to the number of predictors, rather than the number of observations.",2009,Statistical Analysis and Data Mining
A Novel Triage Tool of Artificial Intelligence Assisted Diagnosis Aid System for Suspected COVID-19 Pneumonia in Fever Clinics,"Background: Currently, the prevention and control of COVID-19 outside Hubei province in China, and other countries has become more and more critically serious. We developed and validated a diagnosis aid model without CT images for early identification of suspected COVID-19 pneumonia (S-COVID-19-P) on admission in adult fever patients and made the validated model available via an online triage calculator. 
 
Methods: Patients admitted from Jan 14 to Feb 26, 2020 with the epidemiological history of exposure to COVID-19 were included [Model development (n = 132) and validation (n = 32)]. Candidate features included clinical symptoms, routine laboratory tests and other clinical information on admission. Features selection and model development were based on Lasso regression. The primary outcome is the development and validation of a diagnosis aid model for S-COVID-19-P early identification on admission. 
 
Findings: The development cohort contains 26 S-COVID-19-P and 7 confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia cases. The final selected features included 1 variables of demographic information, 4 variables of vital signs, 5 variables of blood routine values, 7 variables of clinical signs and symptoms, 1 infection-related biomarker. The model performance in held-out testing set and validation cohort resulted in AUCs of 0.841 and 0.938, F-1 score of 0.571 and 0.667, recall of 1.000 and 1.000, specificity of 0.727 and 0.778, and the precision of 0.400 and 0.500. The top 5 important features were Age, IL-6, SYS_BP, MONO%, and Fever classification. Based on this model, an optimized strategy for S-COVID-19-P early identification in fever clinics has also been designed. 
 
Interpretation: S-COVID-19-P could be identified early by a machine-learning model only used collected clinical information without CT images on admission in fever clinics with 100% recall score. The well performed and validated model has been deployed as an online triage tool, which is available at: https://intensivecare.shinyapps.io/COVID19/ .

"Trust, but verify: benefits and pitfalls of least-squares refitting in high dimensions","Least-squares refitting is widely used in high dimensional regression to reduce the prediction bias of l1-penalized estimators (e.g., Lasso and Square-Root Lasso). We present theoretical and numerical results that provide new insights into the benefits and pitfalls of least-squares refitting. In particular, we consider both prediction and estimation, and we pay close attention to the effects of correlations in the design matrices of linear regression models, since these correlations - although often neglected - are crucial in the context of linear regression, especially in high dimensional contexts. First, we demonstrate that the benefit of least-squares refitting strongly depends on the setting and task under consideration: least-squares refitting can be beneficial even for settings with highly correlated design matrices but is not advisable for all settings, and least-squares refitting can be beneficial for estimation but performs better for prediction. Finally, we introduce a criterion that indicates whether least-squares refitting is advisable for a specific setting and task under consideration, and we conduct a thorough simulation study involving the Lasso to show the usefulness of this criterion.",2013,arXiv: Methodology
Abstract P2-03-11: Interaction between smoking history and gene expression levels impacts survival of breast carcinoma patients,"Our investigations explore the association of cigarette smoking on breast cancer risk of recurrence and progression, in contrast to studies that focused on tobacco use and risk of breast cancer occurrence. The goal was to decipher the interaction between smoking history and expression levels of 22 gene candidates selected from microarray data obtained from laser capture microdissected carcinoma cells from 247 de-identified patient tissue biopsies on disease recurrence and overall patient survival of breast cancer patients. qRT-PCR was used to determine expression levels for NAT1, NAT2, COMT, SOD1, SOD2, BRCA1, BRCA2, APOC1, ARID1B, CTNNBL1, MSX1, UBE2F, IRF2, NCOA1, LECT2, THAP4, RIPK1, AGPAT1, C7orf23, CENPN, CETN1 and YTHDC2 selected from a previous study for 50 breast cancer patients with a history of cigarette smoking and 51 patients who had never smoked. For smokers and non-smokers separately, L1-penalized multivariable Cox regression models were fit to predict patient disease-free and overall survival, with 1000 splits of the data into training (70%) and test (30%) sets to determine predictive accuracy based on the C-index. The LASSO penalty was used to perform variable selection in each of the training sets, and a permutation procedure was used to determine a significance threshold for the number of times a variable was kept in the model. Multivariable analyses using the LASSO revealed CENPN, CETN1, CYP1A1, IRF2, LECT2, and NCOA1 to be significant predictors for both disease recurrence and mortality among smokers. Additionally, COMT was highly associated with recurrence, and NAT1 and RIPK1 were associated with mortality. In contrast, only IRF2, CETN1, and CYP1A1 were significant for disease recurrence and mortality among non-smokers, with NAT2 additionally significant for survival. Median, 25th percentile, and 75th percentile for the C-indexes based on the gene expression models are given in Table 1. Analysis of interaction between smoking status and gene expression values using the combined samples revealed significant interactions between smoking status and CYP1A1, LECT2, CETN1. Molecular signatures consisting of 7-8 genes were highly predictive for breast cancer recurrence and overall survival among smokers, with median C-index values of 0.8 and 0.73 for overall survival and recurrence, respectively. In contrast, the median C-index values for non-smokers was only 0.59. Hence, significant interactions between expression of crucial genes and cigarette smoking status appear to play a key role in predicting clinical outcomes of breast carcinoma patients.

PrÃ©sentation clinique et classification du diabÃ¨te sucrÃ© en Afrique sahÃ©lienne. Une expÃ©rience au Burkina-Faso,"Le diabete sucre est peu reconnu en Afrique, ou se pose le probleme de l'existence du diabete nutritionnel. Nous avons mene une etude prospective sur six mois sur des diabetiques vus a l'hopital de Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina-Faso) permettant de colliger 61 dossiers recueillant des informations cliniques, anamnestiques, sociologiques et biologiques completes. La population diabetique se repartissait en DNID : 59 %; DID : 8 %; aucun diabete nutritionnel; 10 % de diabetiques maigres d'Ã¢ge moyen, insulino-necessitants mais resistants a la cetose, que nous appellerons diabete apparente nutritionnel. Le taux de peptide C dans cette derniere categorie etait le double de celui des DID. Les Ã¢ges de decouverte des DID et DNID n'etaient pas statistiquement differents . la quarantaine. La duree d'evolution des DID etait plus courte en raison des complications mortelles plus nombreuses, les complications degeneratives les plus frequentes etaient la retinopathie, la neuropathie, l'HTA et les atteintes des pieds; le nombre de ces complications etait correle a la duree d'evolution de la maladie. L'ensemble des donnees que notre etude souligne se retrouvent dans les autres etudes pratiquees en Afrique noire; notre analyse nous a permis de remettre sous anti-diabetiques oraux de nombreux sujets insulino-traites, ce qui souligne l'importance d'une approche pragmatique de la prise en charge dans ces regions peu munies.",1997,
Provenance and diagenesis of organic matter in Late Cretaceous and Tertiary sediments from the southern Black Sea margin,"ZusammenfassungDie organische Substanz in den Sedimenten der Oberkreide und des TertiÃ¤rs der sÃ¼dlichen Schwarzmeerregion ist dem terrestrischen bis marin-terrestrischen Bereich organischer Fazies zuzuordnen. Innerhalb dieses Bereiches weisen die stratigraphischen Abschnitte unterschiedliche organische Faziestypen auf, die auf unterschiedliche, die Akkumulation und den Erhaltungsgrad der organischen Substanz kontrollierende Prozesse zurÃ¼ckzufÃ¼hren sind.WÃ¤hrend des Obercampan-Maastrichtiums und des PalÃ¤ozÃ¤ns (fore-arc Becken) wurde organisches Material des Schelf/-hanges in den tieferen oxischen Beckenbereichen resedimentiert. Die rasche Zufuhr und Ablagerung fÃ¼hrte zu einem gegenÃ¼ber den autochthonen Sedimenten hÃ¶heren Erhaltungsgrad an lipidreichen, terrestrischen Komponenten (Sporinit, Cutinit, Resinit). Die Zunahme an organischem Kohlenstoff mit steigendem Silt-/Tonanteil bei insgesamt niedrigen Kohlenstoffkonzentrationen in den Resedimenten lÃ¤ÃŸt vermuten, daÃŸ die Akkumulation organischer Substanz in den Liefergebieten durch terrigene Zufuhr bestimmt wurde und die Akkumulationsbedingungen ungÃ¼nstig waren.FÃ¼r das EozÃ¤n ist ein erhÃ¶hter Eintrag an marinem organischem Material zu verzeichnen, der mit der zunehmenden Verflachung des Ablagerungsraumes (fore-arc Becken) und einer Reduzierung im Sauerstoffgehalt des Bodenwassers (abnehmende Bioturbation) erklÃ¤rt wird.FÃ¼r das MiozÃ¤n und PliozÃ¤n (back-arc Becken) ist die organische Fraktion der Ablagerungen des Beckenrandes rein terrestrisch und besteht zum grÃ¶ÃŸten Teil aus Inertinit und wieder aufgearbeitetem terrigenem Liptinit, die oxidative VerhÃ¤ltnisse anzeigen. Die Dominanz von Inertodetrinit im MiozÃ¤n und Semifusinit im PliozÃ¤n indiziert eine Ã„nderung im Liefergebiet oder ein hÃ¶heres Energieniveau beim Transport bzw. im Ablagerungsraum der miozÃ¤nen Randsedimente. Im Beckeninneren ist ein erhÃ¶hter Anteil an mariner organischer Substanz festzustellen, der auf Sauerstoffverarmung oder anoxische VerhÃ¤ltnisse im Bodenwasser zurÃ¼ckgefÃ¼hrt wird. Die Mineralassoziationen in den Sedimenten weisen auf vollstÃ¤ndige Sulfatreduktion und nachfolgende Methanogenese hin, die sich auch mit den Kohlenwasserstoffverteilungen nachvollziehen lÃ¤ÃŸt. Periodisch oxische Bedingungen fÃ¼hren zu einer Reduzierung der marin-liptinitischen Komponente. Im Beckeninneren dominiert jedoch auch die terrigene Fraktion (Huminit/Vitrinit, Inertinit), was auf kontinuierliche Zufuhr vom Beckenrand schlieÃŸen lÃ¤ÃŸt.Die Sedimente der Oberkreide bis PliozÃ¤n sind thermisch unreif (Rm<0.5%, Tmax<435 Â°C).AbstractThe organic matter in the Late Cretaceous and Tertiary sediments from the southern Black Sea margin is assigned to the terrestrial-marine/terrestrial range of organic facies. Within this range, the stratigraphic section yields different organic facies types in response to different accumulation and preservation controlling processes. During the Late Companian-Maastrichtian, organic material from the shelf and slope was re-deposited in the deeper oxic parts of the basin. Rapid transport and sedimentation resulted in a higher degree of preservation of lipid-rich, terrestrial components (sporinite, cutinite, resinite) in comparison to the autochthonous sediments. The increase in organic carbon with increasing silt/clay content together with low carbon concentrations in the allochthonous sediments suggest that the accumulation of organic matter in the source areas was controlled by terrigenous influx and that the accumulation conditions were not favorable.In the Eocene (fore-arc basin), the higher content of marine organic matter can be explained by progressive shallowing of the environment and by reduced oxygen content in the bottom waters (reduced bioturbation).In the Miocene and Pliocene (back-arc basin), the organic fraction of the sediments from the basin margin is purely terrestrial and consists mostly of inertinite and reworked terrigenous liptinite indicating oxidative conditions. The dominance of inertodetrinite in the Miocene and of semifusinite in the Pliocene point to a change in the source area or to a higher energy transport or deposition conditions for the Miocene marginal sediments. In the basin interior, the higher content of marine organic matter is due to an oxygen deficiency or anoxic conditions in the bottom waters. Mineral associations indicate complete sulfate reduction and consequent methanogenesis. This is also implied in the hydrocarbon distributions. Periodic oxic conditions lead to a decrease in the marine liptinitic component. In the basin interior, however, the terrigenous fraction is still dominant, implying a continuous influx from the basin margins.The Late Cretaceous to Pliocene sediments are thermally immature (Rm<0.5%, Tmax<435 Â°C).RÃ©sumÃ©La matiÃ¨re organique contenue dans les sÃ©diments du CrÃ©tacÃ© supÃ©rieur et du Tertiaire de la partie sud de la Mer Noire est Ã  rapporter au domaine de facies organique terrestre Ã  marin-terrestre. La sÃ©rie stratigraphique prÃ©sente, dans les limites de ce domaine, divers types de facies organiques qui traduisent les divers processus qui rÃ©gissent l'accumulation et la prÃ©servation.Au cours du Campanian supÃ©rieur-Maastrichtien, des matÃ©riaux organiques provenant du shelf et du talus continental ont Ã©tÃ© redÃ©posÃ©s dans les parties oxygÃ©nÃ©es plus profondes du bassin. La rapiditÃ© du transport et de la sÃ©dimentation a entraÃ®nÃ© la prÃ©servation de composants terrestres riches en lipides (sporonite, cutinite, rÃ©sinite), dans une mesure plus Ã©levÃ©e que dans les sÃ©diments autochtones. L'augmentation de la teneur en carbone organique corrÃ©lative Ã  celle de la fraction fine (boue et silt), de mÃªme que la faible concentration en carbone des sÃ©diments allochtones indique que, dans la rÃ©gion-source, l'accumulation de matiÃ¨res organiques Ã©tait rÃ©gie par un afflux terrigÃ¨ne et que les conditions d'accumulation n'Ã©taient pas favorables.A l'EocÃ¨ne (bassin d'avant-arc) le contenu en matiÃ¨re organique marine est plus Ã©levÃ©, ce qui s'explique par la diminution progressive de la profondeur et par la rÃ©duction de la teneur en oxygÃ¨ne des eaux du fond (bioturbation rÃ©duite).Au MiocÃ¨ne et au PliocÃ¨ne (bassin d'arriÃ¨re-arc), la fraction organique des sÃ©diments de la bordure du bassin est purement terrestre et consiste principalement en inertinite et en liptinite terrigÃ¨ne remaniÃ©e, ce qui indique des conditions oxydantes. La prÃ©dominance d'inertodÃ©trinite au MiocÃ¨ne et de semifusinite au PliocÃ¨ne indique soit une source diffÃ©rente, soit un transport ou un dÃ©pÃ´t dans les conditions de plus haute Ã©nergie des sÃ©diments miocÃ¨nes marginaux. Vers l'intÃ©rieur du bassin, le contenu plus Ã©levÃ© en matiÃ¨re organique marine est dÃ» Ã  une dÃ©ficience en oxygÃ¨ne ou Ã  des conditions anoxiques dans les eaux de fond. Les associations minÃ©rales indiquent une rÃ©duction complÃ¨te des sulfates et en consÃ©quence une mÃ©thanogenÃ¨se, ce qui ressort Ã©galement de la distribution des hydrocarbures. Des conditions oxydantes pÃ©riodiques provoquent une diminution du composant liptinitique marin. Dans l'intÃ©rieur du bassin, toutefois, la fraction terrigÃ¨ne reste dominante, ce qui implique un afflux continu depuis les marges du bassin.Les sÃ©diments d'Ã¢ge crÃ©tacÃ© supÃ©rieur Ã  pliocÃ¨ne sont thermiquement immatures (Rm<0,5%; Tmax<435 Â°C).ÐšÑ€Ð°Ñ‚ÐºÐ¾Ðµ ÑÐ¾Ð´ÐµÑ€Ð¶Ð°Ð½Ð¸ÐµÐžÐ³Ñ€Ð°Ð½Ð¸Ñ‡ÐµÑÐºÐ¾Ðµ Ð²ÐµÑ‰ÐµÑÑ‚ Ð²Ð¾ Ð²Ñ‹Ð´ÐµÐ»ÐµÐ½Ð½Ð¾Ðµ Ð¸Ð· ÑÐµÐ´Ð¸ Ð¼ÐµÐ½Ñ‚Ð¾Ð² ÑŽÐ¶Ð½Ð¾Ð³Ð¾ Ñ€ÐµÐ³Ð¸Ð¾Ð½Ð° Ð§ÐµÑ€Ð½Ð¾ Ð³Ð¾ Ð¼Ð¾Ñ€Ñ, Ð²Ð¾Ð·Ñ€Ð°ÑÑ‚ ÐºÐ¾Ñ‚Ð¾Ñ€ Ñ‹Ñ… Ð¾Ñ‚Ð½Ð¾ÑÑÑ‚ Ðº Ð²ÐµÑ€Ñ…Ð½ÐµÐ¼Ñƒ Ð¼ÐµÐ»Ñƒ Ð¸ Ñ‚Ñ€ÐµÑ‚ Ð¸Ñ‡Ð½Ð¾Ð¼Ñƒ Ð¿ÐµÑ€Ð¸Ð¾Ð´Ñƒ, ÑÐ»ÐµÐ´Ñƒ ÐµÑ‚ Ð¿Ñ€Ð¸Ñ‡Ð¸ÑÐ»ÑÑ‚ÑŒ Ðº Ð¼Ð°Ñ‚ÐµÑ€Ð¸Ðº Ð¾Ð²Ð¾Ð¼Ñƒ Ð¸ Ð¼Ð°Ñ€Ð¸Ð½Ð¾-Ð¼Ð°Ñ‚ÐµÑ€Ð¸ ÐºÐ¾Ð²Ð¾Ð¼Ñƒ Ñ„Ð°Ñ†Ð¸ÑŽ.

Quantifying dwarf shrub biomass in an arid environment: comparing empirical methods in a high dimensional setting,"Abstract Remote sensing based biomass estimation in arid environments is essential for monitoring degradation and carbon dynamics. However, due to the low vegetation cover in these regions, satellite-based research is challenging. Numerous potentially useful remotely-sensed predictor variables have been proposed, and several statistical and machine-learning techniques are available for empirical spatial modeling, but their predictive performance is yet unknown in this context. We therefore modeled total biomass in the Eastern Pamirs of Tajikistan, a region with extremely low vegetation cover, with a large set of satellite based predictors derived from two commonly used sensors (Landsat OLI, RapidEye), and assessed their utility in this environment using several suitable modeling approaches (stepwise, lasso, partial least squares and ridge regression, random forest). The best performing model (lasso regression) resulted in a RMSE of 992Â kgÂ haâˆ’Â 1 in spatial cross-validation, indicating that biomass quantification in this arid setting is feasible but subject to large uncertainties. Furthermore, pronounced over-fitting in some commonly used models (e.g. stepwise regression, random forest) underlined the importance of adequate variable selection and shrinkage techniques in spatial modeling of high dimensional data. The applied sensors showed very similar performance and a combination of both only slightly improved results of better performing models. A permutation-based assessment of variable importance showed that some of the most frequently used vegetation indices are not suitable for dwarf shrub biomass prediction in this environment. We suggest that predictor variables based on several bands accounting for vegetation as well as background information are required in this arid setting.",2015,Remote Sensing of Environment
Strain-level diversity of secondary metabolism in the biocontrol species Aneurinibacillus migulanus.,"Aneurinibacillus migulanus strains Nagano and NCTC 7096 show potential in biocontrol against fungal and fungus-like plant pathogens, including a wide range of Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and Oomycetes. Differences in terms of the range of pathogens that each strain inhibits, however, suggested that production of a single antibiotic cyclic peptide, gramicidin S (GS), by the two strains, is not the sole mechanism of inhibition. The availability of four sequenced genomes of Aneurinibacillus prompted us to apply genome mining techniques to identify the bioactive potential of A. migulanus and to provide insights into the secondary metabolite arsenal of the genus Aneurinibacillus. Up to eleven secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters were present in the three Aneurinibacillus species. Biosynthetic gene clusters specifying bacteriocins, microcins, non-ribosomal peptides, polyketides, terpenes, phosphonates, lasso peptides and linaridins were identified. Chitinolytic potential and iron metabolism regulation were also investigated. With increasing numbers of biocontrol bacterial genomes being sequenced and mined, the use of approaches similar to those described in this paper will lead to an increase in the numbers of environmentally friendly natural products available to use against plant diseases.",2016,Microbiological research

Exploring Missing Data using Adaptive LASSO Regression Imputation in Relation to Parkinson â€™ s disease,"413 Published By: Blue Eyes Intelligence Engineering & Sciences Publication Retrieval Number: DS2898028419/19Â©BEIESP Abstract: Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD) belongs to a class of chronic disorders that has degenerative neurological symptoms. In the clinical trials, different results falling in the areas of binary, ordinal, and continuous are analyzed to detect manifestation of the symptoms of this disease. A global test statistic is used to comprehensively evaluate the impact of all sorts of results. However, this disease predominantly faces the challenge of missing data that arise in the clinical results for varied reasons such as dropout, death, etc., therefore, imputation of such missing data must be carried out before conducting an intent-to-treat analysis. In fact, accuracy in data pertaining to disease progression may not be possible through statistical analysis without application of an appropriate mechanism that effectively handles missing data. In the p[resent paper, an Adaptive LASSO Imputation method has been proposed with its foundational basis on item response theory so that multiple imputations can be performed while dealing with multiple sources of correlation. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) formula was applied to evaluate the precision of each imputation method. The obtained results prove the better performance analysis of the proposed technique over all the known different algorithms.",2019,

The military function in Late Minoan I Crete: A note,"Abstract This note studies the role of the â€˜militaryâ€™ in the Late Minoan I period in Crete and the nearby Aegean. Late Minoan I Crete is renowned for its relative lack of military evidence, in contract to other regions of the Aegean, and to its own flourishing civilization and widespread cultural influence. This note surveys Late Minoan I military evidence in relation to Crete and other Aegean islands. A basic scenario is proposed in which Late Minoan I Crete was indeed a military power, but with the boundary of its dominanceâ€exchange area outside Crete. This may possibly explain, by analogy with Classical Sparta, the contrasting evidence. The recently revived concept of a Minoan Thalassocracy is thus tentatively supported.",1986,World Archaeology
An Adaptive Ridge Procedure for L0 Regularization,"Penalized selection criteria like AIC or BIC are among the most popular methods for variable selection. Their theoretical properties have been studied intensively and are well understood, but making use of them in case of high-dimensional data is difficult due to the non-convex optimization problem induced by L0 penalties. In this paper we introduce an adaptive ridge procedure (AR), where iteratively weighted ridge problems are solved whose weights are updated in such a way that the procedure converges towards selection with L0 penalties. After introducing AR its specific shrinkage properties are studied in the particular case of orthogonal linear regression. Based on extensive simulations for the non-orthogonal case as well as for Poisson regression the performance of AR is studied and compared with SCAD and adaptive LASSO. Furthermore an efficient implementation of AR in the context of least-squares segmentation is presented. The paper ends with an illustrative example of applying AR to analyze GWAS data.",2016,PLoS ONE
High-dimensional Gaussian and generalized linear mixed models,"Nowadays, statisticians are faced with new challenges due to the availability of high-dimensional data sets in many scientific fields such as biology and information technology. To be more precise, â€highdimensionalâ€ means that we consider situations where the number of observations is much smaller than the number of unknown model parameters. In the simplest example of a linear model, the ordinary least squares estimator is ill-posed in the high-dimensional setup. It is therefore necessary to make additional assumptions in order to deal with this problem. One common approach is based on a sparsity scenario. In other words, it is believed that only a few variables (out of hundreds or thousands) are relevant and hence only a small number of the unknown model parameters is indeed different from zero. Under this sparsity assumption, high-dimensional linear regression problems have been extensively studied over the past years. There has been substantial interest in Lasso-type estimators. The Lasso enforces sparsity by setting some model coefficients exactly to zero. In nearly all these works parameter estimation involves examining convex optimization problems. And therein convexity is a crucial tool for establishing nice statistical theory as well as for developing fast computational algorithms. However, in this thesis, we study a specific class of models involving regularized non-convex optimization problems. We specialise in high-dimensional data which are heterogenous in the sense that the observations are not independent but grouped. More precisely, we assume that observations between units are independent, but measurements within each unit are dependent. This kind of data structure leads to mixed-effects models. The purpose of the present work is to",2011,
"Relicts of a forested past: Southernmost distribution of the hairy frog genus Trichobatrachus Boulenger, 1900 (Anura: Arthroleptidae) in the Serra do Pingano region of Angola with comments on its taxonomic status.","The monotypic genus Trichobatrachus, with its sole representative, the hairy frog, Trichobatrachus robustus Boulenger, 1900, could be considered one of the most well-known frogs of Africa. Despite its broad recognition and the fact that it is considered wide-spread and locally common (Amiet & Burger 2004), surprisingly little is known about the actual distribution and the specific occurrence patterns of the species. It was originally described by Boulenger (1900) from the Benito River, previously erroneously stated to be located in Gabon. However, LÃ¶tters et al. (2001) clarified that the type locality was actually situated in Equatorial Guinea, then part of French Congo, and subsequently provided the first confirmed country record for Gabon. Hairy frogs were previously included in the herpetofaunal lists of Cameroon (Parker 1936; Perret & Mertens 1957), the Democratic Republic of Congo (Laurent 1956), and Nigeria (SchiÃ¸tz 1963). More recently published accounts list them for Cameroon (Euskirchen et al. 1999; Herrmann et al. 2005; Gonwouo & RÃ¶del 2008), Equatorial Guinea (De la Riva 1994; Lasso et al. 2002), Gabon (LÃ¶tters et al. 2001; RÃ¶del & Pauwels 2003; Burger et al. 2004; Pauwels & RÃ¶del 2007; Bell et al. 2011), and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC, Fretey et al. 2011), and speculate about their potential occurrence in Congo and the Cabinda enclave of Angola (Amiet & Burger 2004). The DRC record so far represented the most southerly distribution, while the most northerly account comes from the Adamaoua Province of northern Cameroon (Tadpole voucher MHNG-AMP/ERPI-1035.006 from BÃ©nouÃ© source, Northern cliff NgaoundÃ©rÃ©, Adamaoua, Cameroon/Adamaoua Province, cf. Perret 1966). Specimens stored in the collection at the Royal Museum of Central Africa, Tervuren (RMCA) under collection numbers RMCA B 90060.0004-11 confirm the occurrence of the species in Congo.

The behavioral effects of pesticides in male mice.,"Male Swiss mice, 25-30 g, were utilized to define some of the behavioral effects of the herbicides Lasso [alachlor 43%; (A)], Basalin [fluchloralin 45%; (F)], Premerge 3 [dinoseb 51%; (D)], and the fungicide Maneb-80 [maneb 80%; (M)]. These compounds were tested for their effects on locomotor activity and for their ability to establish a conditioned taste aversion following oral or dermal exposure. Individual and grouped (N = 5) activity measures were assessed immediately following the dermal administration of the commercially available pesticide formulations. Grouped activity measures were also assessed following the oral administration of the compounds. Total activity was significantly (p less than 0.05) increased over vehicle controls in both grouped and individual subjects by A, F, and D following dermal administration. Grouped activity measures were also increased by A, F, D, and M following the oral administration of the compounds. Similar subjects were tested in a conditioned taste aversion paradigm using a normally preferred 0.3% saccharin solution. Animals were given 30 min access to the saccharin solution followed immediately by the administration of the pesticide or control solution. Twenty-four hours later, animals were given the choice of 2 solutions, one containing water and the other the 0.3% saccharin solution. The percent saccharin consumed and the total fluid intake were calculated for each group (N = 8/group). A, F, and D produced a significant aversion to (N = 8/group) the saccharin following both oral and dermal administration. Oral administration of M, but not dermal exposure, also resulted in a flavor aversion. Total fluid intake, however, was not altered by any of the treatments.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1989,Neurotoxicology and teratology
"Prism: Multiple spline regression with regularization, dimensionality reduction, and feature selection","Prism uses a combination of statistical methods to conduct spline-based multiple regression. Prism conducts this regression using regularization, dimensionality reduction, and feature selection, through a combination of smoothing spline regression, PCA, and RVR/LASSO. Smoothing splines can be used to model non-parametric relationships using piece-wise cubic functions (Wahba and Wold 1975; Fox 2000). Relevance vector regression (RVR) refers to application of a relevance vector machine (RVM) to a regression problem; broadly, RVM is similar to multiple linear regression with regularization, using automatic relevance determination for feature selection (Tipping 2000). RVM shares many commonalities with SVM, and is implemented as a special case of a Sparse Bayesian framework (Tipping 2001; Tipping and Faul 2003).",2016,J. Open Source Software
Incentive stackelberg strategies in linear quadratic differential games with two noncooperative followers,"This paper is mainly concerned with the derivation of the sufficient conditions for the incentive Stackelberg strategy in the two-level hierarchical differential games with two noncooperative followers, characterized by a classof linear state dynamics and quadratic cost functionals. In the paper, we first give some concepts in the two-level hierarchical games with two noncooperative followers, and by a simple numerical example, show a general method of solving such a two-level incentive static game problem. Then, we construct a new form of the incentive Stackelberg strategy \(\bar \gamma _0 = \left\{ {\bar \gamma _{0 1} ,\bar \gamma _{0 2} } \right\}\) of the leader P0, and also derive the sufficient conditions which are satisfied by this strategy \(\bar \gamma _0 = \left\{ {\bar \gamma _{0 1} ,\bar \gamma _{0 2} } \right\}\).",1988,
ARTICLE WITH PEER COMMENTARIES AND RESPONSE Children's understanding of the pretence-reality distinction: a review of current theory and evidence,"This paper provides an update on the current status of theory and evidence relating to childrenâ€™s understanding of the pretenceâ€ reality distinction. The paper starts by highlighting the striking paradox between childrenâ€™s early competence in pretence and their experiences of pretenceâ€reality confusions as late as middle childhood. This is followed by a detailed review of various theories that have been offered to explain this phenomenon. Specifically, theories attributing the paradoxical findings to methodological differences between studies are reviewed and dismissed before considering the transmigration and availability hypotheses (Harris, Brown, Marriott, Whittall & Harmer, 1991; Johnson & Harris, 1994), the role of context and the childâ€™s emotional involvement in the pretence, and the pretence continuation account (Golomb & Galasso, 1995). It is argued that none of these theories alone can explain pretenceâ€reality confusions and that these are best explained in terms of the combined influences of cognitive availability, empirical evidence of reality, context, affect and individual differences. Further research is necessary to fully explore the nature, cause and developmental trajectory of individual differences in this domain.",2002,
Nonparametric Sparse Representation,"This paper suggests a nonparametric scheme to find the sparse solution of the underdetermined system of linear equations in the presence of unknown impulsive or non-Gaussian noise. This approach is robust against any variations of the noise model and its parameters. It is based on minimization of rank pseudo norm of the residual signal and l_1-norm of the signal of interest, simultaneously. We use the steepest descent method to find the sparse solution via an iterative algorithm. Simulation results show that our proposed method outperforms the existence methods like OMP, BP, Lasso, and BCS whenever the observation vector is contaminated with measurement or environmental non-Gaussian noise with unknown parameters. Furthermore, for low SNR condition, the proposed method has better performance in the presence of Gaussian noise.",2012,ArXiv
"Patologia anale: emorroidi, ragadi anali e suppurazioni","In proctologia i motivi di richiesta di una visita in urgenza sono caratterizzati dal dolore. Questo e essenzialmente secondario a un accidente di trombosi emorroidaria, a una ragade o a un ascesso. Le rettorragie sono una fonte piu rara di emergenza proctologica. La diagnosi si basa sullâ€™esame clinico e sullâ€™anoscopia. Gli esami di laboratorio sono inutili. In caso di malattia emorroidaria lâ€™escissione di una trombosi emorroidaria esterna puo rapidamente migliorare lo stato del paziente. Il trattamento medico della malattia emorroidaria non esiste e la sua unica indicazione e la politrombosi emorroidaria interna esteriorizzata ed edematosa; si basa allora, per via orale, sugli antinfiammatori non steroidei, sui flebotonici, sugli analgesici e, localmente, su pomate e supposte a base di eparina-idrocortisone. In caso di fallimento di questo trattamento non bisogna esitare a ricorrere alla chirurgia. Le altre manifestazioni (rettorragie e prolasso poco importante) possono beneficiare di varie tecniche strumentali (sclerosi, infrarossi e legatura elastica) che hanno dei risultati comparabili. Occorre tuttavia precisare che, in caso di prolasso emorroidario da sforzo o continuo, la sola soluzione efficace resta lâ€™emorroidectomia. Il trattamento medico della ragade anale (pomata e supposta senza corticosteroidi, lassativi e antalgici) consente la cicatrizzazione, nella stragrande maggioranza dei casi. Tuttavia, bisogna sapere che esiste una malattia ragadica vera e propria, con crisi frequenti. In questo caso la soluzione migliore e quella chirurgica. La nostra preferenza va allâ€™anoplastica senza leiomiotomia piuttosto che alla sfinterotomia laterale, la cui ripercussione sulla continenza anale e lungi dallâ€™essere trascurabile. In caso di suppurazioni anali il trattamento e sempre chirurgico; tuttavia, nella fase di ascesso, quando questo e colliquato, unâ€™incisione in ambulatorio migliora rapidamente lo stato del paziente. Questo trattamento dipende dallâ€™eziologia; la classificazione si basa sui rapporti con il retto e con il canale anale. Il trattamento delle suppurazioni indipendenti dallâ€™anoretto (fistola pilonidale e malattia di Verneuil) e la dissezione-exeresi in blocco delle lesioni. Le suppurazioni la cui origine e a livello del canale anale sono dominate dalle fistole anali (71%), la causa piu frequente delle suppurazioni anoperineali. La classificazione delle fistole e in funzione del loro rapporto con lâ€™apparato sfinterico. Il trattamento di una fistola anale ha essenzialmente due obiettivi: da una parte, estinguere la suppurazione ed evitare la recidiva trattando la cripta responsabile e, dallâ€™altra, rispettare la continenza anale legata allâ€™apparato sfinterico ma anche allâ€™architettura anorettale, il che porta, a volte, a suddividere i tempi operatori. Cosi, le fistole trans-sfinteriche superiori o soprasfinteriche richiedono due tempi chirurgici.",2010,EMC - Urgenze
Extravascular administration of factor IX: potential for replacement therapy of canine and human hemophilia B.,"s of papers on haemophilia from other journals Hepatitis G viral RNA in serum and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and its relation to HCVRNA in patients with clotting disorders. Sheng L, Soumillion A, Peerlinck K, Verslype C, Lin L, van Pelt J, Hess G, Vermylen J, Yap SH. Thromb Haemostas 1997; 77: 868Â±72. The hepatitis G virus (HGV) has recently been identiÂ®ed as a new member of the Flaviviridae family. Infection by this virus is thought to be associated with blood borne hepatitis. In this study, the presence of HCVand HGV-RNAs in serum or plasma (175 patients) and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) (133 patients) was investigated in patients with clotting disorders using a sensitive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). HGVRNA was detected in serum of 26 patients (14.8%). In apparently healthy blood donors, serum HGV-RNA was detected in 4 of 358 individuals investigated (1.12%). Ninety two percent of the 26 serum HGV-RNA positive patients had coinfection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV), especially with HCV genotype Ib, the most common genotype in Belgium. Of these coinfected patients, 15 (62.5%) showed elevated serum ALT levels. Two patients who were solely infected with HGV had normal serum ALT. HGV-RNA in PBMC was found in 18 patients, of whom 3 were negative for serum HGV-RNA. As in case of HCV, HGV-RNA in PBMC is preferentially sensitive to interferon treatment. Nevertheless, rapid reappearance of HGV-RNA in PBMC was observed after cessation of treatment. In one patient, persistent serum ALT elevation seems to be associated with continued HGV viremia, despite the disappearance of serum HCV-RNA. Extravascular administration of factor IX: potential for replacement therapy of canine and human hemophilia B. Liles D, Landen CN, Monroe DM, Lindley CM, Read MS, Roberts HR, Brinkhous KM. Thromb Haemostas 1997; 77: 944Â±8. Current therapy for hemophilia B requires large intravenous doses of factor IX (F.IX) given in the clinic or at home. Although home therapy is possible for many patients, it is often complicated by factors such as the lack of good venous access. Very little is known about extravascular routes for administering proteins like F.IX (57 kD) or other vitamin K-dependent procoagulant factors into the circulation. Questions about the absorption rate from extravascular administration as well as plasma recovery and bioavailability have arisen recently with the growing availability of highly puriÂ®ed procoagulant proteins and increased interest in gene therapy of hemophilia B. Therefore, a group of studies were undertaken to determine the absorption rate, plasma recovery and bioavailability of high purity, human plasma-derived F.IX concentrates administered via extravascular routes in hemophilia B dogs and in one human hemophilia B subject. Five hemophilia B dogs were given human F.IX via either a subcutaneous (SC), intramuscular (IM), intraperitoneal (IP) or intravenous (IV) route. In a subsequent study, a single SC administration of human F.IX was compared to an identical IV dose of F.IX in the human hemophilia B subject. All extravascular routes of F.IX administration in both the canine and human gave lower levels of circulating plasma F.IX than the IV route, however all routes resulted in measurable F.IX activity. Of the extravascular routes, the IM injection in the canine resulted in a bioavailability of 82.8%, while the SC injection resulted in a bioavailability of 63.5%. F.IX reached the plasma compartment by all extravascular routes used, conÂ®rming that F.IX can be absorbed extravascularly. The duration of measurable F.IX activity following extravascular administration is prolonged beyond that typically seen with IV administration. These data show that signiÂ®cant levels of F.IX may be obtained via SC injection in canine and human hemophilia B subjects and further highlight the potential of extravascular routes of administration for future experimental and clinical uses of F.IX and other procoagulant proteins.

Purpose: We present clinical and laboratory data on 18 children from 12 hemophilia treatment centres in the Haemophilia (1997) 3, 231Â±232 # 1997 Blackwell Science Ltd 231 Paper 125 MS Abstracts selected by Dr Donna DiMicheles selected by Dr Donna DiMichele United States, Canada, and Europe with the purpose of disseminating information regarding a recently recognized, potentially life-threatening complication of treatment in very young children with hemophilia B. Patients and Methods: Twelve hemophilia centres from the United States, Canada and Europe provided clinical information and laboratory data concerning 18 children who had severe allergic reactions to infused factor (F) IX in close association with the development of an inhibitor to FIX. Laboratory testing for establishment of the diagnosis of hemophilia B and inhibitor to FIX was done locally at the centers treating these patients. FIX gene analysis was performed at one of six molecular genetics institutes. Results: All 8 children had severe hemophilia B, and in each an inhibitor antibody to FIX developed. The median age at the time of anaphylaxis (or anaphylactoid reaction) was 16 months, and the median number of exposure days to FIX was 11. The FIX inhibitor was detected almost simultaneously with the Â®rst occurrence of anaphylaxis in 12 of 18 patients. Maximum inhibitor titers were 4.5Â±600 Bethesda units (BU), with a median titer of 48 BU. FIX gene analysis, performed in 17 of 18 patients, demonstrated complete deletion of the FIX gene in 10 and major derangements in seven. Immune tolerance induction (ITI) regimens have been attempted in 12 patients, with generally poor responses. Two of the 12 experienced nephrotic syndrome while on ITI. Recombinant FVIIa has been successfully used to treat bleeding episodes in 11 of these children. Conclusion: Physicians treating young children with hemophilia B should be aware of the potentially life-threatening complication of anaphylaxis. Children with complete gene deletions or major derangements of the FIX gene appear to be at greatest risk. Those identiÂ®ed by genotype as being at greater risk may need to receive their Â®rst 10Â±20 treatments in a medical facility equipped for handling such emergencies. Recombinant FVIIa, although not licensed for use in the United States, appears to be the most suitable treatment option for bleeding episodes in such patients. Hemophilia and nonprogressing human immunodeÂ®ciency virus type 1 infection.

Blood 1997; 89: 191Â± 200. Seven of 112 hemophiliacs infected with human immunodeÂ®ciency virus type-1 (HIV-1) before 1986 through contaminated plasma products are currently healthy, with CD4 T-cell counts above 500 cells/mL, and have never received antiretroviral therapy (long-term nonprogressors (LTNPs)). Seven age and sex-matched hemophiliacs infected in the same period but who have progressive HIV disease (progressors) and one additional slow-progressing individual were also studied. One hundred-fold, 20-fold, and 10-fold lower levels of full-length HIV RNA in plasma, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and proviral DNA in PBMCs, respectively, were found in LTNPs compared with progressors. Plasma and cellassociated HIV RNA and proviral DNA were lower in LTNPs who tested negative for viral isolation from PBMCs or who were positive only after removal of CD8 cells. No substantial diÂ€erences were observed in the in vitro production of chemokines including RANTES, MIP-1a, MIP-1b, MCP-1, and interleukin-8 (IL-8) in supernatants of activated PBMCs or CD8-depleted PBMCs of LTNPs, even when HIV isolation was simultaneously accomplished exclusively after removal of CD8 cells. Low levels of HIV load and replication in peripheral blood are the strongest correlates of nonprogression in this small number of infected hemophiliacs.

A prospective, open-label multicenter investigation has been conducted to compare pharmacokinetic parameters of recombinant DNA-derived FVIII (rFVIII) and plasmaderived FVIII concentrate (pdFVIII) and to assess safety and eÂcacy of long-term home-treatment with rFVIII for subjects with hemophilia A. Following comparative in vivo pharmacokinetic studies, 69 patients with severe (n=67) or moderate (n=2) hemophilia A commenced a program of home treatment using rFVIII exclusively for prophylaxis and treatment of all bleeding episodes or a period of 1.0 to 5.7 years (median 3.7 years). The mean in vivo half-lives of rFVIII and pdFVIII were both 14.7 h. In vivo incremental recoveries at baseline were 2.40%/IU/kg and 2.47%/IU/ kg, respectively (p=0.59). The response to home treatment with rFVIII was categorized as good or excellent in 3,195 (91.2%) of 3,481 evaluated bleeding episodes. Thirteen patients received rFVIII for prophylaxis for twenty-four surgical procedures. In all cases, haemostasis was excellent. Adverse reactions were observed in only 13 of 13,591 (0.096%) infusions of rFVIII; none was serious. No patient developed an inhibitor to rFVIII.

Seismic Deconvolution Using Sparse Spike Inversion vs . Basis Pursuit Inversion,"In this paper, we compare two methods for seismic inversion Sparse Spike Inversion (SSI) and Basis Pursuit Inversion (BPI). Both methods utilize sparse inversion techniques. We employ a Least-Angle Regression (LARS) Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) solver for their implementation. Experimental results confirm that L1 penalization in the LASSO optimization improves the performance in terms of recovering reflection coefficients.",2015,
Radiomic signature of 18F fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT for prediction of gastric cancer survival and chemotherapeutic benefits,"We aimed to evaluate whether radiomic feature-based fluorine 18 (18F) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging signatures allow prediction of gastric cancer (GC) survival and chemotherapy benefits. Methods: A total of 214 GC patients (training (n = 132) or validation (n = 82) cohort) were subjected to radiomic feature extraction (80 features). Radiomic features of patients in the training cohort were subjected to a LASSO cox analysis to predict disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) and were validated in the validation cohort. A radiomics nomogram with the radiomic signature incorporated was constructed to demonstrate the incremental value of the radiomic signature to the TNM staging system for individualized survival estimation, which was then assessed with respect to calibration, discrimination, and clinical usefulness. The performance was assessed with concordance index (C-index) and integrated Brier scores. Results: Significant differences were found between the high- and low-radiomic score (Rad-score) patients in 5-year DFS and OS in training and validation cohorts. Multivariate analysis revealed that the Rad-score was an independent prognostic factor. Incorporating the Rad-score into the radiomics-based nomogram resulted in better performance (C-index: DFS, 0.800; OS, 0.786; in the training cohort) than TNM staging system and clinicopathologic nomogram. Further analysis revealed that patients with higher Rad-scores were prone to benefit from chemotherapy. Conclusion: The newly developed radiomic signature was a powerful predictor of OS and DFS. Moreover, the radiomic signature could predict which patients could benefit from chemotherapy.",2018,Theranostics

"Measuring Bipolarization, Inequality, Welfare and Poverty","This paper analyzes the relationship between bipolarization and inequality, welfare and poverty measures. First, we clarify the similarities and differences between bipolarization and inequality measures. Second, it is shown that bipolarization is the difference between the welfare levels of the richer and poorer income groups when feelings of identification between individuals are based on their utility functions. In fact, bipolarization is interpreted as the welfare of the richer group that is wasted to compensate for income bipolarization. Third, a relationship between bipolarization measurement and the normalized poverty deficit index is established. These findings are applied to the polarization measures of Wolfson (1994), Esteban and Ray (1994) and Lasso de la Vega and Urrutia (2006).",2006,
Effects of fluoridation of community water supplies for people with chronic kidney disease.,"Research on the effects of fluorides on oral healthhas been in existence for almost a century. Followingthe observation that communities with naturallyfluoridated drinking water had a lower incidence oftooth decay, many developed countries initiatedartificial water fluoridation programmes, wherebyfluoride is added to the reticulated water supply,such that it reaches approximately one part fluorideper million parts water (ppm) or 1mg fluoride per litreof water (mg/l). Recent reviews [1â€“5] summarizing theextensive fluoride literature have concluded that waterfluoridation reduces the prevalence of dental decay,and it is estimated that a median of six people need toreceive fluoridated water for one extra person to becaries-free [2]. Compared with other methods ofsystemic fluoridation (including fluoridated sugar,milk or salt, fluoride toothpastes, fluoride supple-ments), water fluoridation is argued to be the mostcost-effective, equitable and safe means to providecommunity-wide protection against tooth decay [6].As a result, artificial fluoridation of community watersupplies is currently supported by numerous interna-tional health and dental organizations, including theWorld Health Organization and the InternationalAssociation for Dental Research.However, while access to fluoridated drinkingwater has positive effects on dental health, thecharacteristics of fluoride metabolism mean thatfluoride consumption may have implications for thekidney. The calcified tissues in the human body contain99% of the body burden of fluoride and most of thisis non-exchangeable. Absorption of fluoride is rapidand extensive, with about 50% of the absorbedfluoride becoming associated with calcified tissueswithin 24h and the remainder being excreted in theurine. In infants and young children, the amount offluoride retained in calcified tissues is >50% of theingested daily amount. The renal clearance of fluorideis high, around 30â€“40ml/min in healthy adults [7].Fluoride is freely filtered by the glomerulus and thenundergoes a variable amount of tubular reabsorption.Fluoride excretion falls markedly in the presence ofan acid urine and is increased with higher rates ofurine flow [8â€“10]. Considering the pivotal role of thekidney in the bodyâ€™s ability to metabolize fluoride,there have been surprisingly few attempts to synthesizestudies relating to the relationship between fluorideconsumption and kidney function. The most recentliterature reviews on the health effects of fluorideintake have contained limited discussion on thepotential impact on the kidneys [1â€“5].Recently there has been a resurgence of interest inthe artificial fluoridation of drinking water inAustralia, with efforts to expand the fluoridation ofpublic water supplies to the one remaining unfluori-dated capital city (Brisbane) and several unfluoridatedregional areas. With the renewed debate in Australiaregarding water fluoridation, questions have beenraised concerning the impact of fluoride consumptionfor the large proportion of the Australian populationaffected by chronic kidney disease (CKD). In thegeneral Australian community over age 25, there isevidence of at least one indicator of CKD (proteinuriaor reduced kidney function) in 16% of individuals[11]. However, CKD is frequently asymptomatic,and many afflicted individuals will have significantreduction of kidney function but no overt signs orsymptoms, and hence will be unaware they have thecondition.The United States National Kidney Foundationpublished a brief position statement on fluoridationof drinking water in the early 1980s [12], and concludedthat there was insufficient evidence to recommendthe use of fluoride-free drinking water for all peoplewith CKD. This position statement was reaffirmed in1998, but no new research or discussion was added.",2007,"Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal Association"

"Aestuariihabitans beolgyonensis gen. nov., sp. nov., a novel alphaproteobacterium isolated from tidal flat sediment","A Gram-negative, non-motile and rod-shaped bacterial strain, designated BB-MW15T, was isolated from a tidal flat of the southern coast of the Korean peninsula, and its taxonomic position was investigated by using a polyphasic taxonomic approach. Strain BB-MW15T grew optimally at 30Â Â°C, at pH 7.0â€“8.0 and in the presence of 2â€“3Â % (w/v) NaCl. Strain BB-MW15T exhibited the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity values to the type strains of Marivitabyunsanensis (96.8Â %), Thalassobiusmaritimus (96.6Â %), Sulfitobactermarinus (96.4Â %) and Marinovumalgicola (96.3Â %). Neighbour-joining, maximum-likelihood and maximum-parsimony phylogenetic trees based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain BB-MW15T forms an independent lineage within the evolutionary radiation encompassed by the Roseobacter clade of the class Alphaproteobacteria. Strain BB-MW15T contained Q-10 as the predominant ubiquinone and C18:1Ï‰7c as the predominant fatty acid. The major polar lipids detected in strain BB-MW15T were phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylglycerol, one unidentified aminolipid and one unidentified lipid. The DNA G+C content of strain BB-MW15T is 62.7Â mol%. Based on phylogenetic, chemotaxonomic and other phenotypic characteristics, strain BB-MW15T represents a new genus and a new species within Alphaproteobacteria, for which the name Aestuariihabitans beolgyonensis gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of A. beolgyonensis is BB-MW15T (=Â KCTC 32324TÂ =Â CCUG 63829T).",2013,Antonie van Leeuwenhoek
Autoencoder Feature Selector,"High-dimensional data in many areas such as computer vision and machine learning brings in computational and analytical difficulty. Feature selection which select a subset of features from original ones has been proven to be effective and efficient to deal with high-dimensional data. In this paper, we propose a novel AutoEncoder Feature Selector (AEFS) for unsupervised feature selection. AEFS is based on the autoencoder and the group lasso regularization. Compared to traditional feature selection methods, AEFS can select the most important features in spite of nonlinear and complex correlation among features. It can be viewed as a nonlinear extension of the linear method regularized self-representation (RSR) for unsupervised feature selection. In order to deal with noise and corruption, we also propose robust AEFS. An efficient iterative algorithm is designed for model optimization and experimental results verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.",2017,ArXiv
Abstract 1056: Xenograft-associated B cell lymphoproliferative disease (XABLD) as a surrogate model to study Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) driven B cell Diseases,"Background: Patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDX) are powerful tools to study cancer biology, cancer genomics and developmental therapeutics. A common problem in the development of PDX models is proliferation of atypical lymphocytes at the implantation site, which often overtake or limit the growth of the original tumor. This atypical lymphocyte proliferation has been described as XABLD in our PDX models. In this study, we characterized XABLD cases by morphology, immunophenotyping and genomic profiling. We hypothesize that XABLD tumors are morphologically and phenotypically similar to EBV-driven post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) and diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). XABLD is a surrogate model to study EBV-driven PTLD and DLBCL. Materials and Methods: Models were generated from patient tissue collected under NCI Tissue Procurement Protocol (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT00900198) and CIRB Tissue Procurement Protocol 9846 for development of models for NCIâ€™s Patient-Derived Models Repository (https://pdmr.cancer.gov). Specimens were implanted subcutaneously in NOD/SCID/IL2Rg null (NSG) mice and animal health was monitored throughout the study. Tumors in mice with suspected XABLD were harvested and reviewed by histology and immunohistochemical analysis for CD45, B and T cell markers, EBV status, B-cell clonality assay. All samples were also classified by the Lymph2Cx NanoString cell of origin assay and transcriptome profiling. Results: XABLD cases were found to originate from both solid tumor and circulating tumor cell implants. XABLD is a rapidly growing tumor positive for CD45, CD20, and LMP1 stains, 36 of 42 cases are strongly positive for PD-L1 stain. 39 of 42 cases exhibited an activated B cell (ABC) phenotype with evidence of elevated NF-kB signaling. Most cases were monoclonal for IGK/IGH and contained high numbers of tumor infiltrating CD8-positive T-cells with associated high mRNA expression of activated T cell markers. Conclusion: The clinical presentation, morphology and molecular characteristics of XABLD cases were similar to EBV-driven DLBCL. As the XABLD models exhibited frequent PD-L1 expression and marked infiltration of CD8-positive T cells, they may be useful for in vitro evaluation of checkpoint inhibitor response and T cell antitumor activity.

AvaliaÃ§Ã£o da neutralizaÃ§Ã£o de importantes atividades tÃ³xicas induzidas pelos principais peixes peÃ§onhentos brasileiros por um soro poliespecÃ­fico produzido em murinos.,"BRUNI, F.M. Evaluation of the neutralization of important toxic activities induced by brazilian fish venoms by murine polyspecific antiserum. 2008. 107 f. Master thesis (Immunology) â€“ Instituto de Ciencias Biomedicas, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, 2008. Envenoming induced by venomous fish represents a great cost Brazilian communities. Victims rapidly develop local symptoms as pain, swelling, and necrosis that persist for long days, and in some cases systemic effects are noted. The most frequent venomous fish founded on the Brazilian coast are Thalassophryne nattereri (niquim), Cathorops spixii (bagre), Scorpaena plumieri (peixe-escorpiao) and Potamotrygon gr orbygnyi (arraia). The anti-inflammatory drugs used (dexamethasone and indomethacin) are not efficient in reducing the clinical symptoms. After bits of venomous animals, the passive transfer of heterologous specific antibodies allows that immediate toxic effect can be neutralized in the victims. Recently, anti-venom for accidents caused by stonefish of the Indo-Pacific Ocean has been used. The aim of this work was to produce in mice polyspecific antivenom for neutralization of the main toxic effects induced by the Brazilian venomous fish. Independent groups of Swiss mice were immunized at days 0, 14, and 28 with 10 Î¼g of each venom or at days 0 and 14 with 10 Î¼g of each venom adsorbed in Al(OH)3. The animals were bled at days 35 or 28, respectively for monospecific antibody levels determination by ELISA. The polyspecific antiserum achieved by the addition of 1 mg of IgG from each monospecific antiserum was used for neutralizations assays for two methods of evaluation, for preincubation and independent injection (immediate and after 15 minutes). Initially, we observed a full recognition of all antigenic bands of the four venoms by polyspecific antiserum. The effects induced by all venoms in the microcirculation were abolished by the polyspecific antiserum, except for the effects caused by C. spixii in muscular fibers where was necessary a proportion of 1:2 for abolish the effect. The polyspecific antiserum controlled the edematogenic and nociceptive activities caused by all venoms, being more efficient in controlling the nociception induced by the P. gr orbygnyi venom and the airway inflammation induced by the S. plumieri venom. These data allow us to suggest the use of polyspecific antiserum in the treatment of the pathological effects provoked by the most frequent Brazilian venomous fish.",2008,
Job in the Reformation Bible : Traditional Religious Belief and Its Critique,"In a stimulating study of â€˜literature and the godsâ€™, Robert Calasso reports that the poet MallarmÃ© was misquoting Euripides when he wrote, shockingly: â€˜If the gods do nothing unseemly, then they are no longer gods at allâ€™. For, Calasso says, what Euripides actually wrote was, â€˜If the gods do aught unseemly, then they are not gods at all [emphasis added]â€™. In fact, I submit, the two translations are not really antithetical. For both acknowledge â€“ one overtly, the other implicitly â€“ that the Greek gods are not â€˜moralâ€™, whether we judge them on the basis of their own â€˜unseemlyâ€™ deeds or on the basis of the â€˜unseemlyâ€™ deeds of men and women that they allow to transpire. And, to be sure, by any human standard of judgment, the problem of divine morality persists â€“ indeed, it becomes even more grave â€“ in a world with only one all-powerful and benevolent God. Of all the books in the Hebrew Bible, none is more perplexing in its audacious acknowledgment of the flawed morality of the JudeoChristian God than the Book of Job. In the Talmudic period, and throughout the Middle Ages and Early Modern periods, influential rabbis could not decide if Job was a Jew or a gentile, or even if he really existed, and if so, when? Was the story a true history, or perhaps it was merely a moral fable? Some early Jewish authorities,",2006,

A Greedy Homotopy Method for Regression with Nonconvex Constraints,"The goal of this paper is to estimate sparse linear regression models, where for a given partition G of input variables, the selected variables are chosen from a diverse set of groups in G. We consider a novel class of nonconvex constraint functions, and develop RepLasso, a greedy homotopy method that exploits geometrical properties of the constraint functions to build a sequence of suitably adapted convex surrogate problems. We prove that in some situations RepLasso recovers the global minima path of the nonconvex problem. Moreover, even if it does not recover the global minima, we prove that it will often do no worse than the Lasso in terms of (signed) support recovery, while in practice outperforming it. We show empirically that the strategy can also be used to improve over various other Lasso-style algorithms. Finally, a GWAS of ankylosing spondylitis highlights our methodâ€™s practical utility.",2015,
Oversampled Adaptive Sensing with Random Projections: Analysis and Algorithmic Approaches,"Oversampled adaptive sensing (OAS) is a recently proposed Bayesian framework which sequentially adapts the sensing basis. In OAS, estimation quality is, in each step, measured by conditional mean squared errors (MSEs), and the basis for the next sensing step is adapted accordingly. For given average sensing time, OAS reduces the MSE compared to non-adaptive schemes, when the signal is sparse. This paper studies the asymptotic performance of Bayesian OAS, for unitarily invariant random projections. For sparse signals, it is shown that OAS with Bayesian recovery and hard adaptation significantly outperforms the minimum MSE bound for non-adaptive sensing. To address implementational aspects, two computationally tractable algorithms are proposed, and their performances are compared against the state-of-the-art non-adaptive algorithms via numerical simulations. Investigations depict that these low-complexity OAS algorithms, despite their suboptimality, out-perform well-known non-adaptive schemes for sparse recovery, such as LASSO, with rather small oversampling factors. This gain grows, as the compression rate increases.",2018,2018 IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology (ISSPIT)

Simulation results are included to illustrate the controller performance. that compensated for unknown, constant disturbances while pro- ducing globally asymptotically decaying position tracking errors. This controller, however, required exact knowledge of the space- craft parameters. In this paper we consider the full nonlinear dynamics describ- ing the relative positioning of MSFF for control design purposes. Using Lyapunov-based control design and stability analysis tech- niques, we develop a nonlinear adaptive control law that guarantees global asymptotic convergence of the spacecraft relative position to any sufe ciently smooth desired trajectory, despite the presence of unknown, constant, or slow-varying spacecraft masses, disturbance forces, and gravity forces.

"MallarmÃ©: RanciÃ¨re, Milner, Badiou by Robert Boncardo and Christian R. Gelder (review)","ConstituÃ© dâ€™entretiens avec trois philosophes contemporains majeurs, que peu de choses rapprochent si ce nâ€™est leur intÃ©rÃªt pour MallarmÃ©, le livre de Robert Boncardo et Christian R. Gelder est bien plus polÃ©mique, bien plus explosif, mÃªme, quâ€™il nâ€™en a lâ€™air Ã  premiÃ¨re vue. Il a le grand mÃ©rite, dâ€™abord, de rappeler que le poÃ¨te est encore Ã  lâ€™origine de pensÃ©es abstraites, malgrÃ© la domination depuis une bonne dizaine dâ€™annÃ©es, dans un champ toujours en expansion, de lâ€™approche socio-historique. Câ€™est avec le MallarmÃ© moderniste quâ€™on fait Ã  nouveau connaissance ici, celui de la rupture entre langue poÃ©tique et langage ordinaire dâ€™abord, puis celui de la rÃ©volution par le verbe, pas seulement cÃ©lÃ©brÃ© mais aussi pris Ã  partie par les philosophes continentaux dÃ¨s les annÃ©es 1970. StructurÃ©e Ã  partir de ces deux grands dÃ©bats, une longue Introduction prÃ©sente les trois philosophes au moyen dâ€™un chiasme annonÃ§ant lâ€™ordre â€” bizarrement jamais commentÃ© â€” dans lequel leurs entretiens sont ensuite prÃ©sentÃ©s: les positions de RanciÃ¨re, Milner et Badiou sur les enjeux linguistiques de lâ€™Å“uvre de MallarmÃ© sont expliquÃ©s dans un premier temps, lâ€™Introduction clarifiant ensuite les discours de Badiou, Milner et RanciÃ¨re sur son importance politique.

BLASSO: integration of biological knowledge into a regularized linear model,"BackgroundIn RNA-Seq gene expression analysis, a genetic signature or biomarker is defined as a subset of genes that is probably involved in a given complex human trait and usually provide predictive capabilities for that trait. The discovery of new genetic signatures is challenging, as it entails the analysis of complex-nature information encoded at gene level. Moreover, biomarkers selection becomes unstable, since high correlation among the thousands of genes included in each sample usually exists, thus obtaining very low overlapping rates between the genetic signatures proposed by different authors. In this sense, this paper proposes BLASSO, a simple and highly interpretable linear model with l1-regularization that incorporates prior biological knowledge to the prediction of breast cancer outcomes. Two different approaches to integrate biological knowledge in BLASSO, Gene-specific and Gene-disease, are proposed to test their predictive performance and biomarker stability on a public RNA-Seq gene expression dataset for breast cancer. The relevance of the genetic signature for the model is inspected by a functional analysis.ResultsBLASSO has been compared with a baseline LASSO model. Using 10-fold cross-validation with 100 repetitions for modelsâ€™ assessment, average AUC values of 0.7 and 0.69 were obtained for the Gene-specific and the Gene-disease approaches, respectively. These efficacy rates outperform the average AUC of 0.65 obtained with the LASSO. With respect to the stability of the genetic signatures found, BLASSO outperformed the baseline model in terms of the robustness index (RI). The Gene-specific approach gave RI of 0.15Â±0.03, compared to RI of 0.09Â±0.03 given by LASSO, thus being 66% times more robust. The functional analysis performed to the genetic signature obtained with the Gene-disease approach showed a significant presence of genes related with cancer, as well as one gene (IFNK) and one pseudogene (PCNAP1) which a priori had not been described to be related with cancer.ConclusionsBLASSO has been shown as a good choice both in terms of predictive efficacy and biomarker stability, when compared to other similar approaches. Further functional analyses of the genetic signatures obtained with BLASSO has not only revealed genes with important roles in cancer, but also genes that should play an unknown or collateral role in the studied disease.",2018,BMC Systems Biology
Estimation of a sparse group of sparse vectors,"We consider estimating a sparse group of sparse normal mean vectors, based on penalized likelihood estimation with complexity penalties on the number of nonzero mean vectors and the numbers of their significant components, which can be performed by a fast algorithm. The resulting estimators are developed within a Bayesian framework and can be viewed as maximum a posteriori estimators. We establish their adaptive minimaxity over a wide range of sparse and dense settings. A simulation study demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed approach, which successfully competes with the sparse group lasso estimator. Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.",2011,Biometrika
Bauxite quality classification by shrinkage methods,"Abstract Geochemically, bauxite ore may contain some clay minerals, aluminum oxides-hydroxides, and insoluble materials such as quartz and magnetite. The amounts of the geochemical components and their ratios (modules) have critical importance in bauxite quality classification. A classification study was conducted by way of Al2O3/SiO2 module and its corresponding indicators such as spatial coordinates, thickness, and some of the geochemical contributors. The classification was made benefit of two advanced regularization methods such as ridge and the Lasso regression methods. Accuracy, interpretability and simplicity were appraised. Both the algorithms had influence on reducing variance. The smoothing levels of the algorithms also were discussed. The resulting classification provided by the strong estimators can provide a reliable tool for industrial decision making and control.",2018,Journal of Geochemical Exploration
Abstract 2064: Differences in methylation patterns by pediatric germ cell tumor histologic subtype,"Anomalous DNA methylation contributes to carcinogenesis by regulating gene expression and may be important in germ cell tumor (GCT) development as germ cells undergo tremendous epigenetic reprogramming during embryogenesis. Histologic subtypes of GCTs show differences in global methylation patterns with less differentiated tumors (e.g. embryonal carcinoma) experiencing lower levels of global methylation relative to more differentiated tumors (e.g. teratoma). Differences in promoter methylation have also been reported in GCTs. In particular, developmental signaling pathways and the BMP/TGF beta pathway have been consistently found to be differentially methylated. In this analysis, we conducted an epigenome wide association study to identify gene-specific methylation differences by GCT histology. Using the Illumina HumanMethylation450K array we determined methylation profiles for 154 pediatric GCTs (21 germinomas, 54 mixed, 9 teratomas, 70 yolk sac tumors [YST]) from fresh frozen and formalin fixed paraffin embedded tumor tissue samples. Fisher9s exact tests were used to assess differences in the distributions of age group, sex, and tumor location by histologic subtype (alpha=0.05 for a two-sided test of significance [SAS v9.4]). Bioconductor package minfi was used to identify differential methylation between GCT histologic subtypes by comparing the methylation beta values. To identify differential methylation of genes predictive of tumor histology, a generalized linear model (glm) with LASSO was fit (R v3.4.1) to the quantile normalized beta values for all probes from all samples. There were significant differences in age, sex, and tumor location by histologic subtype (all p Citation Format: Lindsay A. Williams, Lauren Mills, Anthony J.

Renewing the Infinite Conversation: System and Method in Blanchot.,"Blanchot's thought is to some extent an attempt to grasp the absolute, or at least to open a conversation with the infinite. My question here is how he sets out to do that, and if I'm asking this question today with renewed emphasis it is in part because of the work of Alain Badiou and Quentin Meillassoux, both of whom overcome - or claim to overcome - the constraints of finitude and renew the speculative project. As one would expect, this overcoming of finitude carries with it at least an implicit, if not an explicit, critique of those who have come before. Meillassoux has gone further in this direction than Badiou, constructing an entire typology of methodological failures which fall under the name ""correlationism.""1 Blanchot, however, provides a difaferent and historically richer approach to these questions. To make this point, in this essay I ask two related questions: what is the meaning of being according to Blanchot, and how does he know that; in other words, what is his system and what is his method? It's this insistence on system that distinguishes my Blanchot from that of his many excellent readers. Gerald Bruns' description of his approach to Blanchot is a good description of the dominant tendency in much of the secondary literature. Because Blanchot's texts are so difficult and often themselves fragmentary, Bruns practices what he calls ""philological"" reading. By philology he does not mean the close attention to specific words, their conventional and historical usage, and the ways in which that history speaks in the present. He means the close attention to moments of Blanchot's texts: ""Philology works from the bottom up. Since ancient times, it has meant a concentration on the bits and pieces of texts, moving from one fragment to another as best one can.""2 My approach, while heavily indebted to Bruns, is exactly the opposite. Instead of thinking the fragment, I want search for - and construct - the whole. This search is warranted for two reasons, one external to Blanchot's work, one internal. Reading from the outside, we can't help but notice that there is an unmistakable monotony in Blanchot. His essays, whether on Kafka, Rilke, or Weil, continually tend toward a broad but finite set of themes - death, writing, worklessness, and time, to name only four. Some of these are clearly more fundamental than others - worklessness, for example - and while we could remain content to say that his thought simply tends toward these fuzzy concepts, there must also come a time when we begin to push for more specificity with regard to the relations between concepts. This isn't just a requirement of a naive reading from the outside, however. Blanchot's thought, I will argue at the end of this essay, requires the construction of a whole - even if it is ultimately inauthentic. The fragmentary impulse is fundamentally tied to a totalizing impulse. The first part of this essay is simply a broad sketch of the outlines of this system. I should say at the start that I do not expect this system to eventually achieve the kind of self-referential totality of the rationalists' God. Rather it is the kind of totality that Blanchot thinks Nietzsche teaches us to see: ""The incomparably instructive force of Nietzsche's thought is precisely in alerting us to a non-systematic coherence, such that all that relates to it seems to press in from all sides in order to resemble a coherent system, all the while differing from one.""3 After sketching the outlines of this non-coherent system, I will raise the question of method. System Alain Badiou has claimed that Gilles Deleuze's work, far from constituting a series of ""monstrous productions,"" as Deleuze himself claimed,4 was actually only a series of monotonous productions. While Deleuze begins by speaking about the most diverse topics, Badiou claims, he always ""arrives at conceptual productions that one could unhesitatingly qualify as monotonous, composing a very particular regime of emphasis or almost infinite repetition of a limited repertoire of concepts. â€¦",2012,Philosophy Today
Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) producing and oil degrading bacteria isolated from the northern Gulf of Mexico,"Sinking marine oil snow was found to be a major mechanism in the transport of spilled oil from the surface to the deep sea following the Deepwater Horizon (DwH) oil spill. Marine snow formation is primarily facilitated by extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), which are mainly composed of proteins and carbohydrates secreted by microorganisms. While numerous bacteria have been identified to degrade oil, there is a paucity of knowledge on bacteria that produce EPS in response to oil and Corexit exposure in the northern Gulf of Mexico (nGoM). In this study, we isolated bacteria from surface water of the nGoM that grow on oil or Corexit dispersant. Among the 100 strains isolated, nine were identified to produce remarkable amounts of EPS. 16S rRNA gene analysis revealed that six isolates (strains C1, C5, W10, W11, W14, W20) belong to the genus Alteromonas; the others were related to Thalassospira (C8), Aestuariibacter (C12), and Escherichia (W13a). The isolates preferably degraded alkanes (17-77%), over polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (0.90-23%). The EPS production was determined in the presence of a water accommodated fraction (WAF) of oil, a chemical enhanced WAF (CEWAF), Corexit, and control. The highest production of visible aggregates was found in Corexit followed by CEWAF, WAF, and control; indicating that Corexit generally enhanced EPS production. The addition of WAF and Corexit did not affect the carbohydrate content, but significantly increased the protein content of the EPS. On the average, WAF and CEWAF treatments had nine to ten times more proteins, and Corexit had five times higher than the control. Our results reveal that Alteromonas and Thalassospira, among the commonly reported bacteria following the DwH spill, produce protein rich EPS that could have crucial roles in oil degradation and marine snow formation. This study highlights the link between EPS production and bacterial oil-degrading capacity that should not be overlooked during spilled oil clearance.",2018,PLoS ONE
Parasite diversity of Nyctiphanes simplex and Nematoscelis difficilis (Crustacea: Euphausiacea) along the northwestern coast of Mexico.,"The diversity of parasites found on Nyctiphanes simplex and Nematoscelis difficilis (Order Euphausiacea) was compared during 10 oceanographic cruises made off both coasts of the Baja California peninsula, Mexico. We tested the hypothesis that N. simplex has a more diverse parasitic assemblage than N. difficilis because it is a neritic species, has larger population abundance, and tends to form denser and more compact swarms than N. difficilis. These biological and behavioral features may enhance parasite transmission within swarms. We detected 6 types of ectoparasites: (1) epibiotic diatoms Licmophora sp.; (2) Ephelotidae suctorian ciliates; (3) Foettingeriidae exuviotrophic apostome ciliates; (4) an unidentified epicaridean cryptoniscus larvae (isopoda); and 2 castrators: (5) the ectoparasitic Dajidae isopod Notophryxus lateralis and (6) the ellobiopsid mesoparasite Thalassomyces fagei. We also detected 7 types of endoparasites: (1) an undescribed Collinia ciliate (Apostomatida); 3 types of Cestoda: (2) a Tetrarhynchobothruium sp. (Trypanorhyncha), (3) Echinobothrium sp. (Diphyllidea: Echinobothyriidae), and (4) unidentified metacestode; (5) a Trematoda Paronatrema-like metacercaria (Syncoeliidae); (6) the nematode Anisakis simplex (L3); and (7) Polymorphidae acantocephalan larvae (acanthor, acanthella, and cystacanth larval stages). N. simplex is affected by all types of parasites, except the isopod N. lateralis, having a considerably larger parasitic diversity and prevalence rates than N. difficilis, which is only infested with 3 types of ectoparasites and T. fagei. Euphausiid swarming is an adaptive behavior for reproduction, protection against predators, and increased efficiency in food searching, but has a negative effect due to parasitism. Although the advantages of aggregation must overcome the reduction of population and individual fitness induced by parasites, we demonstrated that all types of parasites can affect approximately 14% of N. simplex individuals. Collinia spp. endoparasitoids must occasionally have a significant influence on population mortality with potential epizootic events.",2010,Diseases of aquatic organisms
Effects of Extracts from Rhus Verniciflua S. on Activity of Catalase and TPA Mediated-Apoptosis in Cultured Mouse Hepatocytes,"The ethanol extract of Rhus verniciflua S. was subsequently isolated and fractioned into two portions using HO and 99% ethanol as elution buffers through silica gel column chromatography. To study the antioxidative effect of Rhus verniciflua S. extracts, cultured hepatocytes were exposed to hydroxyl radical generated by 20 mU ml glucose oxidase for 4 h in the presence or absence of water or ethanol eluted extracts. Addition of 100 g ml water extract to the culture medium protected from hydroxyl radical-mediated cytotoxicity of hepatocytes almost equivalently to the control. When the hepatocytes after culture for 24 h were incubated with 100 g ml water or ethanol extract without glucose oxidase for 4 h, activity of catalase was increased by 1.40- and 1.31-fold, compared to the control, whereas with the commercial catalase (100 units ml) was 1.64-fold. These results show that in vitro both extracts has a potential reducing cytotoxicity effect on hydroxyl radical and enhancing activities of the cellassociated catalase in cultured hepatocytes. Apoptosis induced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA, 100 nM) in mouse hepatocytes were blocked by the addition of 100 g ml of water or ethanol extract. In the biological effects of two extracts, water extract was more effective than that of ethanol extract.",2002,Journal of Applied Biological Chemistry

Model-Consistent Sparse Estimation through the Bootstrap,"We consider the least-square linear regression problem with regularization by the $\ell^1$-norm, a problem usually referred to as the Lasso. In this paper, we first present a detailed asymptotic analysis of model consistency of the Lasso in low-dimensional settings. For various decays of the regularization parameter, we compute asymptotic equivalents of the probability of correct model selection. For a specific rate decay, we show that the Lasso selects all the variables that should enter the model with probability tending to one exponentially fast, while it selects all other variables with strictly positive probability. We show that this property implies that if we run the Lasso for several bootstrapped replications of a given sample, then intersecting the supports of the Lasso bootstrap estimates leads to consistent model selection. This novel variable selection procedure, referred to as the Bolasso, is extended to high-dimensional settings by a provably consistent two-step procedure.",2009,ArXiv

Development of a dna vaccine against _streptococcus mutans_: A novel approach to immunization against dental caries,"Streptococcus mutans is the main causative agent of dental caries, which is a widespread infectious disease. A number of surface molecules are involved in the pathogenicity of this organism, including adherence and aggregation factors. The wallassociated protein A (WapA) of Streptococcus mutans GS-5 was previously demonstrated to be a sucrose-dependent adherence and aggregation factor, and is a larger precursor to extracellular antigen A (AgA), a candidate antigen for a dental caries vaccine. The full-length wapA gene and a C-terminal truncated version agA encoding the AgA were cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA 3.1/V5/His-TOPO. The above constructs were mixed with a cationic lipid and used to transfect Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Transient expression of the wapA and agA genes was observed at 24 h post-transfection, as shown by Western immunoblot analysis. In CHO, cells WapA containing the membrane and wall-spanning region was found in apoptotic bodies, whereas the soluble AgA, which lacked the hydrophobic region, was found in extracellular medium. A higher salivary IgA level was observed in mice immunized with the pcDNA-",2005,
Application of support vector regression to genome-assisted prediction of quantitative traits,"A byproduct of genome-wide association studies is the possibility of carrying out genome-enabled prediction of disease risk or of quantitative traits. This study is concerned with predicting two quantitative traits, milk yield in dairy cattle and grain yield in wheat, using dense molecular markers as predictors. Two support vector regression (SVR) models, Îµ-SVR and least-squares SVR, were explored and compared to a widely applied linear regression model, the Bayesian Lasso, the latter assuming additive marker effects. Predictive performance was measured using predictive correlation and mean squared error of prediction. Depending on the kernel function chosen, SVR can model either linear or nonlinear relationships between phenotypes and marker genotypes. For milk yield, where phenotypes were estimated breeding values of bulls (a linear combination of the data), SVR with a Gaussian radial basis function (RBF) kernel had a slightly better performance than with a linear kernel, and was similar to the Bayesian Lasso. For the wheat data, where phenotype was raw grain yield, the RBF kernel provided clear advantages over the linear kernel, e.g., a 17.5% increase in correlation when using the Îµ-SVR. SVR with a RBF kernel also compared favorably to the Bayesian Lasso in this case. It is concluded that a nonlinear RBF kernel may be an optimal choice for SVR, especially when phenotypes to be predicted have a nonlinear dependency on genotypes, as it might have been the case in the wheat data.",2011,Theoretical and Applied Genetics

Improving Teaching Evaluation using Text Mining,"To better evaluate teaching performance is an important topic in education research. Traditionally, quantitative data are collected through Likert scales. However, such data ignore the subtle information regarding teaching. Although open-ended or free-style questions are often used to collect additional information on teaching performance, the resulting data are often in qualitative text format and rarely analyzed. Therefore, it is necessary to build a system to score and extract important information from the qualitative text data. In this study, we use a variety of machine learning algorithms such as LASSO and convolutional neural network to understand the relationship between the quantitative rating data and the qualitative text data. The study leads to a model that can quantify the text data for teaching evaluation.",2019,
Lasso Peptide Benenodin-1 Is a Thermally Actuated [1]Rotaxane Switch.,"Mechanically interlocked molecules that change their conformation in response to stimuli have been developed by synthetic chemists as building blocks for molecular machines. Here we describe a natural product, the lasso peptide benenodin-1, which exhibits conformational switching between two distinct threaded conformers upon actuation by heat. We have determined the structures of both conformers and have characterized the kinetics and energetics of the conformational switch. Single amino acid substitutions to benenodin-1 generate peptides that are biased to a single conformer, showing that the switching behavior is potentially an evolvable trait in these peptides. Lasso peptides such as benenodin-1 can be recognized and cleaved by enzymes called lasso peptide isopeptidases. We show that only the native conformer of benenodin-1 is cleaved by its cognate isopeptidase. Thus, thermally induced conformational switching of benenodin-1 may also be relevant to the biological function of these molecules.",2017,Journal of the American Chemical Society
"Early/Middle Period Subsistence Changes at SBA-1, Rincon Point, California","In general terms the changes at SBA-1 appear to reflect a broadening of the resource base, with fish and shellfish making up a greater share of the protein captured in the later period. This is in general agreement with the patterns predicted by regional theories dealing with environmental change and population growth in the Santa Barbara Channel region (Glassow 1980a: 14). Archaeological data (Glassow, Wilcoxon, and Erlandson n.d.) suggest that populations in the channel region were increasing during the periods in question. Such an increase in the number of people utilizing the region's resources would be likely to produce an intensification in the use of the marine environment as a result of the limitations on the terrestrial resources in the narrow coastal zone.

Lacan e lâ€™etica al femminile,"Nel Seminario VII Lacan, in polemica con lâ€™Ipa (International PsychoanalyticalAssociation), opera uno spostamento di cio che e il centro dellacura analitica dalla tecnica allâ€™etica. Non si tratta di avere a che fare conle strategie infinite relative ai movimenti del transfert e del cosiddettocontrotransfert a cui sempre paziente e analista sembrano sospesi e conloro le sorti della cura. Si tratta invece di avere a che fare con cio cheguida lâ€™agire degli essere umani e la loro ricerca della felicita: il soggettoe guidato dal godimento verso quello che Lacan, mutuando il termine daFreud, chiamera la Cosa. Questo orienta il suo agire, di questo lâ€™analistadeve tenere conto. Dunque abbiamo a che fare con il desiderio (anche seda ora in poi Lacan parlera di godimento) che, come qualcuno ha credutopossibile, non puo essere sottoposto a procedure di â€œortopediaâ€, comedel resto gia aveva chiaramente detto Freud affermando lâ€™indistruttibilitadel desiderio infantile. Gli esseri umani sono guidati dalla ricerca impossibiledel primo insostituibile Altro, lâ€™oggetto per sempre perduto, il primodelle cure, il primo che si sottrae e che trasforma il grido del bambinoin appello consentendo cosi lâ€™accesso alla parola e allâ€™universo simbolico,naturalmente la madre. Da li nasce lâ€™incolmabile mancanza che, tuttavia,non cessa di voler essere colmata. E questo movimento verso il recuperodel primo Altro che orienta il desiderio e dunque lâ€™agire degli esseriumani. Come Lacan esplicitera nellâ€™Etica, si tratta di das Ding, lâ€™oggettodellâ€™incesto che e un bene interdetto e che e il Sommo Bene, perche â€œnoncâ€™e altro beneâ€.",2013,
"Chirons, geminions, centauros, decays into pions: a phenomenological and theoretical analysis","SummaryWe analyse the data on multiple production of hadrons from very-high-energy interactions, both at cosmic-ray energies and at accelerator energies. We show that these data are compatible with a discrete mass spectrum of fireballs, which are formed in the very-high-energy collisions and trail the colliding hadrons after the interaction. Such fireballs seem to possess different decay modes: either into pions only, or into baryons only. The decays are statistical and we derive their temperature; for instance, in the so-called Â«Chiron modeÂ» the temperature is about 10 GeV, which shows that the existence of a limiting temperature of 160 MeV in high-energy collisions is violated. Moreover, we present a theoretical model for decay events like Chirons, Centauros and Geminions in terms of evaporating Â«strong black-holesÂ». Our analysis seems to suggestâ€”among the othersâ€”that in the considered collisions some Â«phase transitionsÂ» can take place, associated with the collapse of the colliding matter inside its strong-Schwarzschild horizons. The horizon radii are in good agreement with experience and, in their turn, yield the transition temperatures through a Hawking-like relation. At these very high temperatures the emission of heavy objects is expected to be enhanced, so as it is observed experimentally. Many aspects of the data are reasonably well explained by our theoretical model.RiassuntoSi analizzano i dati sulla produzione multipla di adroni in interazioni ad altissima energia, prodotte sia da raggi cosmici, sia in macchine acceleratrici. Si mostra come questi dati siano compatibili con una serie discreta di fireball, generate nelle dette collisioni ad altissima energia e che proseguono nella direzione degli adroni incidenti. Tali fireball sembrano possedere diversi modi di decadimento, o in soli pioni, o in soli barioni. I decadimenti sono statistici e se ne ricava la temperatura corrispondente; ad esempio, nel cosiddetto Â«Chiron-modeÂ» (o modo chironico), la temperatura risulta di cirea 10 GeV, il che mostra che l'usuale limite di 160 MeV per le collisioni ad alta energia Ã¨ qui ampamente violato. Si presenta inoltre un modello teorico per i decadimenti del tipo a Chironi, a Centauri e a Gemini basato sull'evaporazione di opportuni Â«buchi neri fortiÂ». La presente analisi sembra suggerireâ€”tra l'altroâ€”che nelle collisioni considerate abbiano luogo delle Â«transizioni di faseÂ», associate al collasso della materia collidente all'interno dei suoi orizzonti (tipo Schwarzschild) forti. I raggi degli orizzonti risultano in buon accordo con l'esperienza e, a loro volta, forniscono la temperatura della transizione per mezzo di una relazione di tipo Hawking. A tali altissime temperature ci si aspetta che l'emissione di oggetti pesanti sia favorita, cosÃ­ come si osserva sperimentalmente. Molti aspetti dei dati sperimentali sono spiegati ragionevolmente bene dal modello teorico proposto.Ð ÐµÐ·ÑŽÐ¼ÐµÐœÑ‹ Ð°Ð½Ð°Ð»Ð¸Ð·Ð¸Ñ€ÑƒÐµÐ¼ Ð´Ð°Ð½Ð½Ñ‹Ðµ Ð¿Ð¾ Ð¼Ð½Ð¾Ð¶ÐµÑÑ‚Ð²ÐµÐ½Ð½Ð¾Ð¼Ñƒ Ñ€Ð¾Ð¶Ð´ÐµÐ½Ð¸ÑŽ Ð² ÑÐ¾ÑƒÐ´Ð°Ñ€ÐµÐ½Ð¸ÑÑ… Ð¿Ñ€Ð¸ Ð¾Ñ‡ÐµÐ½ÑŒ Ð±Ð¾Ð»ÑŒÑˆÐ¸Ñ… ÑÐ½ÐµÑ€Ð³Ð¸ÑÑ…, Ð¿Ñ€Ð¸ ÑÐ½ÐµÑ€Ð³Ð¸ÑÐ¸ ÐºÐ¾ÑÐ¼Ð¸Ñ‡ÐµÑÐºÐ¸Ñ… Ð»ÑƒÑ‡ÐµÐ¹ Ð¸ Ð¿Ñ€Ð¸ ÑÐ½ÐµÑ€Ð³Ð¸ÑÑ…, Ð´Ð¾ÑÑ‚Ð¸Ð¶Ð¸Ð¼Ñ‹Ñ… Ð½Ð° ÑƒÑÐºÐ¾Ñ€Ð¸Ñ‚ÐµÐ»ÑÑ….

"Spermatophores of thalassoid gastropods (Paludomidae) in Lake Tanganyika, East Africa, with a survey of their occurrence in Cerithioidea: functional and phylogenetic implications",". With few exceptions, spermatozoa-encapsulating packages in molluscs are known mostly from cephalopods and pulmonate gastropods. Among non-stylommatophoran gastropods, the marine Cerithioidea are second only to the Neritimorpha in the number of species that posess a spermatophore, but they have only rarely been found in freshwater taxa of this superfamily. We describe and compare here the sperm packages of 11 paludomid cerithioideans as part of an ongoing study on the evolution and systematics of the thalassoid (i.e., â€œmarine-likeâ€) endemic species flock from Lake Tanganyika. Stereomicroscopic and SEM examination revealed unexpected complexity in shape and structure of spermatophores within paludomids. In addition, we present a survey of other Cerithioidea, which revealed that spermatophores are in general structurally simple and confirmed their presence in 12 marine species (five families) and 15 limnic species (four families), including those of 10 thalassoid species for which spermatophores are described herein. Based on histological sections of the male genital tract, we hypothesize that spermatophores are formed anteriorly, wholly or in part, by the so-called spermatophore-forming organ, and which is considered a synapomorphy of the Paludomidae. In addition, we briefly discuss functional aspects inferred from morphological study of the spermatophore-forming organ, with possible implications for spermatozoan transfer and fertilization. Finally, we place the features of the spermatophores and the spermatophore-forming organ in a phylogenetic framework of cerithioidean and paludomid systematics, which suggests that the spermatophore-forming organ is a synapomorphy of Paludomidae, that a bifurcate spermatophore structure is plesiomorphic, and that the evolution of structurally complex, spiny spermatophores has occurred independently in disparate lineages within the thalassoid species flock.",2005,Invertebrate Biology

Retrograde trans-posterior communicating artery snare-assisted rescue of lost access to a foreshortened pipeline embolization device: complication management.,"BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE
The Pipeline embolization device (PED; Covidien Vascular Therapies, Mansfield, Massachusetts) is a promising, yet experimental, vascular reconstruction device for the treatment of complex intracranial aneurysms. We present a PED-related complication and describe a salvage strategy.


CLINICAL PRESENTATION
A 64-year-old woman underwent PED-assisted parent vessel reconstruction for her giant cavernous internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysm. During placement of the first PED, the proximal part of the PED foreshortened and was displaced into the aneurysm sac. Multiple subsequent attempts to recatheterize the PED failed, and, ultimately, distal access through and beyond the PED was lost. Therefore, completion of the Pipeline construct by stacking PEDs for definitive treatment was prevented. Retrograde access of the PED was gained from the distal ICA through a microwire that was advanced from the basilar artery through the posterior communicating artery. The microwire from the distal ICA was grasped with a snare from the proximal ICA and pulled down to the cervical ICA. The opened snare around the microwire was used as a lasso to advance a microcatheter from the cervical ICA through the PED to regain distal access. Five more PEDs were used to achieve complete parent vessel reconstruction and aneurysm obliteration.


CONCLUSION
Maintaining distal access is critical until the entire parent vessel is reconstructed, especially when multiple PEDs are required. The salvage technique described may help regain distal access if it is lost during the procedure.",2010,Neurosurgery
Strong rules for discarding predictors in lasso-type problems.,"We consider rules for discarding predictors in lasso regression and related problems, for computational efficiency. El Ghaoui and his colleagues have propose 'SAFE' rules, based on univariate inner products between each predictor and the outcome, which guarantee that a coefficient will be 0 in the solution vector. This provides a reduction in the number of variables that need to be entered into the optimization. We propose strong rules that are very simple and yet screen out far more predictors than the SAFE rules. This great practical improvement comes at a price: the strong rules are not foolproof and can mistakenly discard active predictors, i.e. predictors that have non-zero coefficients in the solution. We therefore combine them with simple checks of the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions to ensure that the exact solution to the convex problem is delivered. Of course, any (approximate) screening method can be combined with the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker, conditions to ensure the exact solution; the strength of the strong rules lies in the fact that, in practice, they discard a very large number of the inactive predictors and almost never commit mistakes. We also derive conditions under which they are foolproof. Strong rules provide substantial savings in computational time for a variety of statistical optimization problems.",2012,"Journal of the Royal Statistical Society. Series B, Statistical methodology"
"Pre-slaughter handling of reindeer bulls {Rangifer tarandus tarandus L.) â€” effects on technological and sensory meat quality, blood metabolites and muscular and abomasal lesions","Forty-one reindeer bulls (age 1 1/2 years) were subjected to different pre-slaughter treatments: herding for a short distance to a grazing corral, selection by use of a lasso, lorry transport and helicopter herding for 1, 2 and 3 days respectively. As control, 9 reindeer were shot without previous handling (in the mountains). The results indicated the traditional selection technique of using a lasso to be the most stressful and glycogen-depleting handling procedure so far studied. In the lasso-selected reindeer the lowest glycogen values and the highest ultimate pH values in the meat were measured. The values of the measured parameters indicating stress (aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT), urea, Cortisol and abomasal lesions) were also highest in these reindeer. By contrast, the modern method of herding by helicopter was not found to be detrimental to glycogen content, ultimate pH, the measured blood metabolites, or the frequency of abomasal lesions. In all treatment groups degenerative lesions were observed in the skeletal muscles. No relarionship between technological and sensory meat quality characteristics and skeletal muscle lesions in reindeer could, however, be found in this study. The study confirmed an earlier finding that a 'stress-flavour' could develop in reindeer meat after intensive pre-slaughter handling of the animals. Further study of when and how such ""stress-flavour"" develops ought to be undertaken.",1996,Rangifer
Red List of Azorean endemic cave adapted arthropods: an ecological and conservation overview,"The Azorean endemic arthropod fauna includes seventeen species and subspecies adapted to the subterranean environment. Most of these species are known from single lava-tubes or volcanic pits (seven out of the 17 species) and only a few are widespread (namely Trechus terceiranus and Trechus picoensis). Moreover, many of the caves are under severe impact of the main economic activity on Azores, dairyâ€“cattle production. Consequently, it is urgent to assess the conservation status of the Azorean endemic cave arthropod fauna. The aims of this contribution are twofold: 1. present the results of the first IUCN red-list assessment of the conservation status of Azorean endemic cave adapted arthropods (e.g. Borges et al. 2016, Borges and Amorim 2017a, Borges and Amorim 2017b, Borges and Amorim 2017c, Boieiro et al. 2018, Borges and Amorim 2018a, Borges and Amorim 2018b, Borges and Amorim 2018c, Borges and Amorim 2018d, Borges and Amorim 2018e, Rego et al. 2018) and 2. present an overview of the major threats involving the conservation of those species.

Overall, 15 out of the 16 assessed species are threatened (CR+ EN + VU). The most diverse group, the ground-beetles (Coleoptera, Carabidae) include half of the assessed species and have five species considered as Critically Endangered (CR) (Thalassophilus azoricus, Trechus jorgensis, Trechus montanheirorum, Trechus oromii, Trechus pereirai). Most of the species have small extent of occurrence (EOO less than 12 km2) and reduced area of occupancy (AOO less than 12 km2). The main current threat to the species is the impact of agriculture activities. We suggest as future measures of conservation the regular monitoring of the species (every ten years) and fencing the entrances of the caves where human intrusion and disturbance has been occurring. The Azorean Government will publish legislation for the protection of the most important Azorean caves in 2018.",2018,

Pathway-based Analysis with Support Vector Machine (SVM-LASSO) for Gene Selection and Classification,"Genomic knowledge has become a popular research field in bioinformatics biological process that providing further biological process information. Many methods have been done to address the issues of high data throughput due to increased use of microarray technology. However, it is still not able to determine the appropriate diseases accurately. This is because of existing non-informative genes that could be included in the analysis of context specific data like cancer gene expression data, which affect the classification performance. This study proposed a pathway-based analysis for gene classification. Pathway-based analysis enable handling microarray data in order to improved biological interpretation of the analysis outcome. Secondly, Support Vector Machine with Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator algorithm (SVM-LASSO) is proposed, which to find informative genes for each pathway to ensure efficient gene selection and classification in every pathway. Experiments are done using lung cancer dataset and breast cancer dataset that widely used in cancer classification area. A stratified 10-fold cross validation is implement to evaluate the performance of the proposed method in terms of accuracy, specificity and sensitivity. Moreover, biological validation have been done on the selected genes based on biological literatures and biological databases. Next, the results from the proposed methods are compared with the previous study throughout all the data sets in terms of performance. As conclusion, this research finding can contribute in biology area especially in cancer classification area.",2017,"International Journal on Advanced Science, Engineering and Information Technology"
Mujeres indÃ­genas en la Ã©pica histÃ³rica hispanoamericana,"Epic poetry has always been considered a masculine genre. The eruption of a group identity, masculine, white, aristocratic and christian, is the result of the representation and the exclusion of the Other, fictitious and singular, but in fact composed of a variety of ethnic groups, origins, sex, genders, religions and different degrees between fiction and historicity. Indeed, in the historical epic poetry which narrated the Conquest, except for the conquistadors listed at length and the indigenous kings and caciques, only few characters are distinguished by a historical individualisation. The Other, Amerindian and female, makes a shy entrance into history, into singularity, into the (historical and christian) truth. It is the case of interpreters: Malinche and India Catalina, only historical native women that appear as part of the narrative plot as well as in the conquest enterprise in the poems of Lasso de la Vega (Cortes valeroso y Mexicana, Mexicana), of Juan de Castellanos (Elegias de varones ilustres de Indias) and of Saavedra Guzman (El peregrino indiano).",2016,Hipogrifo: Revista de Literatura y Cultura del Siglo de Oro
"Expression of Ribosomal Protein S6 (R6SP) and Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor 4E Binding Protein 1 (EIF4EBP1) Is Correlated in Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML) and Is Highly Prognostic, Especially in NPM1 and FLT3 Wildtype Patients","Background. Conceptually mRNA processing and ribosomal regulation should interact as both affect mRNA translation and protein production. We studied protein expression and functional relationships between proteins in AML using a custom made reverse phase protein array (RPPA), probed with 231 strictly validated antibodies. We found a relationship between expression of R ibosomal P rotein S6 (HUGO name R6SP, a.k.a. S6RP) and E ukaryotic Translation I nitiation F actor 4E B inding P rotein 1, (HUGO name EIF4EBP1). R6SP, a 40S ribosomal subunit component, activated by phosphorylation, regulates cell growth via selective mRNA translation. EIF4EBP1 interacts with eIF4E to recruit the 40S ribosomal subunit, thereby affecting ribosomal assembly. When phosphorylated, in response to cellular signaling, it releases eIF4E allowing transcription.

Methods. Our RPPA has protein from leukemia enriched cells from 511 newly diagnosed AML patients and was probed with 231 strictly validated antibodies, including antibodies against total RPS6 and forms phosphorylated on S235-236 and S240-244, and against total EIF4EBP1 and forms phosphorylated on T37 & 46, T70 and S65. Expression was compared to normal bone marrow derived CD34+ cells. Interaction networks with the other 224 proteins were generated from the RPPA data using glasso and supplemented by the literature of known interactions.

Results. A heatmap of expression of the 3 R6SP and 4 PA2 forms was generated and hierarchical k-and means clustering performed (Fig A). Using the Â“ Prototype Clustering Â”method an optimal division into four clusters (Fig B) was determined. This includes an Â“All-OffÂ” state (18%), a state characterized by weak activation of RPS6 alone (RP-Only, 36%) activation of only EIF4EBP1 (EIF4EBP1-Only, 26%) and a group where both were on simultaneously (Both-On). The RPS6 interactome (Fig B) showed the expected positive correlation with mTOR, and P70 (Hugo RPS6KB1) and a previously unknown, but very strong, negative correlation with transcription factor ZNF296. The EIF4EBP1 interactome showed the expected strong positive correlation with many signal transduction pathways (MAP2K1, MAPK14) and proliferation related proteins (pRB, EIF2AK, EIF2S1, FOXO3) and negative correlation with several transcription factors (GATA3, SPI1, CREB). Cluster membership was unassociated with most clinical features including cytogenetics, FLT3 , RAS and NPM1 mutation, excluding gender (more F in All-Off, more M in Both-On, p=0.01). EIF4EBP1 and Both-On had higher WBC (p=0.0001) and % marrow (p=0.0001) and blood blasts (0.0007) and lower platelet counts (p=0.025). Response rates did not differ, although fewer All-Off were primary refractory. Relapse was more common in EIF4EBP1-Only and Both-On clusters. Overall survival (OS) and remission duration (RemDur) (Fig C) of the EIF4EBP1-Only and Both-On clusters was inferior to that of the All-Off and RP-Only clusters (OS median 41 & 45 vs. 52 &63,p=0.06, RemDur 39 & 27 weeks vs. 63 & 53, p=0.008) but this was restricted to Intermediate cytogenetics cases (Fig C Â“IntCytoÂ” OS 49 & 55 weeks vs. 107& 79 p=0.01, RemDur 37 & 35 weeks vs. 89 & 53 , p = 0.005) that were FLT3 mutation ((Fig C Â“FLT3-WTÂ” OS p=0.006, RemDur p0.007) and NPM1 mutation negative (Fig C Â“NPM1-WTÂ”, OS p=0.006, RemDur p=0.001).

Conclusions. Activation of EIF4EBP1, with or without RPS6 activation is prognostically adverse in AML, particularly in intermediate cytogenetic cases with wildtype FLT3 and NPM1. This is associated with increased proliferation. Therapy directed against EIF4EBP1 activity, e.g. that block it's phosphorylation, may have utility in the ~46% of cases of AML that demonstrate high levels of EIF4EBP1 phosphorylation, especially in FLT3/NPM1 wildtype cases.

Bayesian Model Averaging for Lasso Using Regularization Path,"We consider the problem of accounting for model uncertainty in LASSO models. Bayesian model averaging (BMA) provides a coherent mechanism for accounting for this model uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a method for implementing Bayesian model averaging for LASSO based on regularization path. First, we construct the initial model set using the regularization path, whose inherent piecewise linearity makes the construction easy and effective. Then, we elaborately select the models for BMA from the initial model set through the Occamâ€™s Window method. Finally, we carry out the BMA on the selected models. Experimental results show that BMA has significant advantage over the model selection method based on Bayesian information criterion (BIC).",2012,
In vivo percutaneous absorption and skin decontamination of alachlor in rhesus monkey.,"The objectives of this study were to determine the percutaneous absorption of alachlor relative to formulation dilution with water, and to determine the ability of soap and water, and of water only, to remove alachlor from skin, relative to time. Alachlor is a preemergence herbicide. The in vivo percutaneous absorption of alachlor in rhesus monkeys was 17.3 +/- 3.3, 15.3 +/- 3.9, and 21.4 +/- 14.2% for 24-h skin exposure to Lasso formulation diluted 1:20, 1:40, and 1:80, respectively. In vivo, there was no support for increased alachlor skin absorption with water dilution, as previously reported for in vitro absorption. The average in vivo absorption of 18% applied dose over 24 h (0.75%/h) was similar to the maximum in vitro rate of 0.8%/h using human skin and human plasma as receptor fluid. Dose accountability in vivo was 80.6-95.2%. [14C]Alachlor in Lasso diluted 1:20 with water was placed on rhesus monkeys at concentrations of 23 micrograms/10 microliters/cm2. Skin decontamination at 0 h with soap and water (50% Ivory liquid 1:1 v/v with water) removed 73 +/- 15.8% (n = 4) of the applied dose with the first wash; this increased to a total of 82.3 +/- 14.8% with two additional washes. Decontamination after 1 h removed 87.5 +/- 12.4% with three successive washes. After 3 h decontamination ability decreased, and after 24 h only 51.9 +/- 12.2% could be recovered with three successive washes. Using water only, at 0 h 36.6 +/- 12.3% alachlor was removed with the first wash and the total increased to 56.0 +/- 14.0% with two additional washes. At 24 h the total amount decreased to 28.7 +/- 12.2% for three successive washes. Alachlor as Lasso in field-use rate (11 micrograms/cm2) and undiluted (217 and 300 micrograms/cm2) proportions were left on rhesus monkey skin for 12 h and decontaminated with soap and water (10% Ivory liquid v/v with water). Continual successive washes (6-8 in sequence) recovered 80-90% of the skin-applied alachlor. These results suggest that simple washing with soap and water is appropriate for removing some chemicals from skin. Decontamination with only water was less effective than with soap and water.",1992,Journal of toxicology and environmental health

Variable selection for general transformation models with ranking data,"In this paper, we consider variable selection problem for general transformation models with ranking data by penalized maximum log-marginal likelihood approach. We incorporate smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD), lasso and hard thresholding penalties into penalty term. With some conditions and proper penalties, we show that the corresponding penalized estimates are âˆšn-consistent and enjoy oracle properties. We also propose a three-step Monte Carlo Markov chain stochastic approximation algorithm for our proposed procedures. With the proposed procedure, we not only can select important variables but also are able to estimate corresponding effects. Through some simulation examples and a Hong Kong horse racing data analysis, we illustrate that our proposed procedure uniformly works very well for moderate sample size.",2014,Statistics
Improving stability and interpretability of gene expression signatures,"Motivation Molecular signatures for diagnosis or prognosis estimated from large-scale gene expression data often lack robustness and stability, rendering their biological interpretation challenging. Increasing the signatureâ€™s interpretability and stability across perturbations of a given dataset and, if possible, across datasets, is urgently needed to ease the discovery of important biological processes and, eventually, new drug targets. Results We propose a new method to construct signatures with increased stability and easier interpretability. The method uses a gene network as side interpretation and enforces a large connectivity among the genes in the signature, leading to signatures typically made of genes clustered in a few subnetworks. It combines the recently proposed graph Lasso procedure with a stability selection procedure. We evaluate its relevance for the estimation of a prognostic signature in breast cancer, and highlight in particular the increase in interpretability and stability of the signature.

Variable Selection and Estimation in Multivariate Functional Linear Regression via the Lasso,"In more and more applications, a quantity of interest may depend on several covariates, with at least one of them infinite-dimensional (e.g. a curve). To select relevant covariate in this context, we propose an adaptation of the Lasso method. The criterion is based on classical Lasso inference under group sparsity (Yuan and Lin, 2006; Lounici et al., 2011). We give properties of the solution in our infinite-dimensional context. A sparsity-oracle inequality is shown and we propose a coordinate-wise descent algorithm, inspired by the glmnet algorithm (Friedman et al., 2007).

SpeciallÃ¤rarnas tankar kring Ã¶vergÃ¥ngen frÃ¥n gymnasiesÃ¤rskolan till Daglig verksamhet. En intervjustudie med sju pedagoger,"Examensarbete: 15 hp Program: SpeciallÃ¤rarprogrammet, LLU600 NivÃ¥: Avancerad nivÃ¥ Termin/Ã¥r: Vt/2015 Handledare: Jan-Ã…ke Klasson Examinator: Anders Hill Rapport nr: VT15 IPS01 LLU600 Nyckelord: grav utvecklingsstÃ¶rning, gymnasiesÃ¤rskola, Individuella programmet, daglig verksamhet Syfte: Studiens syfte var att undersÃ¶ka hur sju speciallÃ¤rare uppfattar Ã¶verlÃ¤mnandeprocesser av elever till Daglig verksamhet under sista Ã¥ret i gymnasiesÃ¤rskolans individuella program. Teori: Studien har en hermeneutisk ansats. Detta val baseras pÃ¥ studiens fokus pÃ¥ speciallÃ¤rarnas uppfattningar av elevernas Ã¶verlÃ¤mning frÃ¥n gymnasiesÃ¤rskolan till Daglig verksamhet. Inom hermeneutiken Ã¤r fÃ¶rfÃ¶rstÃ¥elsen ett viktigt begrepp. FÃ¶rfÃ¶rstÃ¥elsen Ã¤r den fÃ¶rsta av alla hermeneutiska betingelser. Genom fÃ¶rstÃ¥else och tolkning nÃ¥r mÃ¤nniskan kunskap. Att tolka mÃ¤nniskors uppfattningar och upplevelser samt att fÃ¶rsÃ¶ka leva sig in i intervjupersonernas verklighet Ã¤r det centrala i denna forskningsteori. Empati eller inlevelse i andra personers mentala liv Ã¤r en av arbetsmetoderna fÃ¶r hermeneutiken. I studien har det fÃ¶rekommit en viss fÃ¶rfÃ¶rstÃ¥else i Ã¤mnet, vilket har varit av godo eftersom forskaren i detta fall har god kÃ¤nnedom om den studerande verksamheten. Metod: Avsikten med studien har varit att ta del av speciallÃ¤rarnas uppfattningar. Med detta som bakgrund var det naturligt att vÃ¤lja en kvalitativ ansats med intervjuer som metod. Urvalet bestÃ¥r av sju speciallÃ¤rare dÃ¤r samtliga arbetar som speciallÃ¤rare. Intervjuerna Ã¤r inspelade och har senare blivit transkriberade. Stukat (2011) menar att resonemanget av tÃ¤nkbara, trovÃ¤rdiga tolkningar av resultatet och undersÃ¶kningsmetoden Ã¤r vÃ¤sentlig fÃ¶r generaliserbarheten. FÃ¶rfattaren menar vidare att man mÃ¥ste resonera kring vem resultat egentligen gÃ¤ller fÃ¶r. (a.a.). Det kan vara svÃ¥rt att gÃ¶ra nÃ¥gra generaliseringar utifrÃ¥n detta dÃ¥ studien endast redovisar en liten undersÃ¶kningsgrupp. VetenskapsrÃ¥dets (2007) forskningsetiska principer som Ã¤r informationskravet, samtyckeskravet, konfidentialitetskravet och nyttjandekravet har fÃ¶ljt i studien. Resultat: SpeciallÃ¤rarna hade olika upplevelser och svÃ¥rt med separationen nÃ¤r eleverna skulle sluta gymnasiesÃ¤rkolan och bÃ¶rja pÃ¥ Daglig verksamhet. Det var svÃ¥rt att hÃ¥lla distans till eleverna och en av orsakerna var att det Ã¤r smÃ¥ klasser. Det var en lÃ¥ng process med mÃ¥nga personer inblandade, dÃ¥ det var olika mÃ¶ten och planering som skulle ske. Det svÃ¥raste fÃ¶r speciallÃ¤rarna var sjÃ¤lva studentdagen dÃ¥ avslutet skedde med bÃ¥de eleven och fÃ¶rÃ¤ldrarna. Det var ocksÃ¥ en del speciallÃ¤rare som saknade handledning och att fÃ¥ tala om kÃ¤nslor och tankar i samband med Ã¶verlÃ¤mnandet. Mest oro infÃ¶r Ã¶verlÃ¤mnandet till Daglig verksamhet var hur denna verksamhet kunde ta emot elevernas olika kommunikationshjÃ¤lpmedel. SpeciallÃ¤rarna menade hÃ¤r att de hade byggt upp denna kompetens under en lÃ¥ng tid och att den dagliga verksamheten inte alltid ansÃ¥gs ha en sÃ¥dan vid Ã¶verlÃ¤mnandet. Det visade sig att speciallÃ¤rarna hade mer behov av handledning, och att det trodde att de skulle kunna fÃ¥ det.",2015,
Could the Decision of Trial Participation Precede the Informed Consent Process? Evidence From Burkina Faso,"BACKGROUND
Over the last years, the number of clinical trials carried out in low-income countries with poor medical infrastructure and limited access to health care has increased. In these settings, the decision of participating in a clinical study may be influenced by factors related to participants' vulnerability that limit the efficacy of the informed consent.


METHODS
A mixed methods social science study, based on the triangulation of qualitative and quantitative data, was carried out in a socio-economically disadvantaged and semi-urban area of Bobo Dioulasso, Burkina Faso. The study aimed at assessing the relevance of the informed consent procedure on the decision-making process of the parents and/or guardians of potential participants in a pediatric malaria trial.


RESULTS
For most parents (70.4%), the decision of participating had already been taken before undergoing the informed consent process and was based on the information conveyed through the community. Access to free and good quality health care often inspired this decision. In addition, the parents' willingness to have their child included in the trial made them develop active strategies to achieve this purpose.


DISCUSSION
In a context of socio-economic vulnerability and poor access to free health care, the process of informed consent does not always accomplish its goal of informing people and enabling them to make a free and informed decision. This information role is somehow anticipated by the community and trial participation becomes a strategic action to secure otherwise unavailable health resources leading community members to decide on participation even prior to the informed consent process.",2013,PLoS ONE
Sparse Additive Subspace Clustering,"In this paper, we introduce and investigate a sparse additive model for subspace clustering problems. Our approach, named SASC (Sparse Additive Subspace Clustering), is essentially a functional extension of the Sparse Subspace Clustering (SSC) of Elhamifar & Vidal [7] to the additive nonparametric setting. To make our model computationally tractable, we express SASC in terms of a finite set of basis functions, and thus the formulated model can be estimated via solving a sequence of grouped Lasso optimization problems. We provide theoretical guarantees on the subspace recovery performance of our model. Empirical results on synthetic and real data demonstrate the effectiveness of SASC for clustering noisy data points into their original subspaces.",2014,
Sex dependent risk factors for mortality after myocardial infarction: individual patient data meta-analysis,"BackgroundAlthough a number of risk factors are known to predict mortality within the first years after myocardial infarction, little is known about interactions between risk factors, whereas these could contribute to accurate differentiation of patients with higher and lower risk for mortality. This study explored the effect of interactions of risk factors on all-cause mortality in patients with myocardial infarction based on individual patient data meta-analysis.MethodsProspective data for 10,512 patients hospitalized for myocardial infarction were derived from 16 observational studies (MINDMAPS). Baseline measures included a broad set of risk factors for mortality such as age, sex, heart failure, diabetes, depression, and smoking. All two-way and three-way interactions of these risk factors were included in Lasso regression analyses to predict time-to-event related all-cause mortality. The effect of selected interactions was investigated with multilevel Cox regression models.ResultsLasso regression selected five two-way interactions, of which four included sex. The addition of these interactions to multilevel Cox models suggested differential risk patterns for males and females. Younger women (age <50) had a higher risk for all-cause mortality than men in the same age group (HR 0.7 vs. 0.4), while men had a higher risk than women if they had depression (HR 1.4 vs. 1.1) or a low left ventricular ejection fraction (HR 1.7 vs. 1.3). Predictive accuracy of the Cox model was better for men than for women (area under the curves: 0.770 vs. 0.754).ConclusionsInteractions of well-known risk factors for all-cause mortality after myocardial infarction suggested important sex differences. This study gives rise to a further exploration of prediction models to improve risk assessment for men and women after myocardial infarction.",2014,BMC Medicine
The effect and correlation factors of segmental pulmonary veins isolation for paroxysmal and persistent atrial fibrillation,"Objective To evaluate the effect of segmental pulmonary veins isolation for atrial fibrillation (AF) and investigate the possible factors that may affect its result. Methods In 120 (105 men; age 50.0Â±8.6 years) consecutive patients with paroxysmal (n=99) or persistent (n=21) AF, segmental PVs electrical isolation with Lasso mapping catheters was performed. The relationship of the outcome of the initial procedure and factors such as age, sex, type of AF, left atrial diameter, case history, left ventricular ejection fraction and presence of hypertension were analyzed by statistical methods. Results 52 (52.5%) out of the 99 patients with paroxysmal AF and 6 (28.5%) out of the 21 with persistent AF were free of AF after a single ablation procedure. Univariate analysis revealed that left atrial enlargement (P=0.001), persistent AF (P=0.046) and old age (P=0.047) were related to the recurrence of AF after the first procedure. Patients with paroxysmal AF apparently had a better outcome than those with persistent AF after repeat ablation but of no statistical significance (P=0.094). Logistic regression analysis revealed that left atrial enlargement was the only independent risk factor of recurrent AF after the first procedure. Conclusion About 50% of the patients with paroxysmal AF are free of AF after single ablation. Left atrial enlargement is the only independent risk factor of recurrent AF while old age and persistent AF influence the outcome of the first procedure.",2005,Chinese Journal of Interventional Cardiology
Consistent neighbourhood selection for sparse high-dimensional graphs with the Lasso,"The pattern of zero entries in the inverse covariance matrix of a multivariate normal distribution corresponds to conditional independence restrictions between variables. The structure is most conveniently summarized in a graphical model (Lauritzen, 1996). Covariance selection (Dempster, 1972) aims at estimating those structural zeros from data. The complexity of standard covariance selection methods is, however, very high, making inference of all but lowdimensional graphs infeasible. Moreover, existence of the MLE estimate cannot be guaranteed and the performance of the method is poor if the number of observations is small compared to the number of variables. We propose neighborhood selection with the Lasso as a computationally attractive alternative to standard covariance selection for sparse high-dimensional graphs. Neighborhood selection estimates the conditional independence restrictions separately for each node in the graph. We show that the proposed neighborhood selection scheme is consistent for sparse high-dimensional graphs. The consistency hinges on the choice of the penalty parameter. The oracle value for optimal prediction does not lead to a consistent neighborhood estimate. It is proposed instead to control the probability of falsely joining some distinct connectivity components of the graph. This leads to consistent estimation for sparse graphs (with exponential rates), even when the number of variables grows like the number of observations raised to an arbitrary power.",2004,

FFTLasso: Large-Scale LASSO in the Fourier Domain,"In this paper, we revisit the LASSO sparse representation problem, which has been studied and used in a variety of different areas, ranging from signal processing and information theory to computer vision and machine learning. In the vision community, it found its way into many important applications, including face recognition, tracking, super resolution, image denoising, to name a few. Despite advances in efficient sparse algorithms, solving large-scale LASSO problems remains a challenge. To circumvent this difficulty, people tend to downsample and subsample the problem (e.g. via dimensionality reduction) to maintain a manageable sized LASSO, which usually comes at the cost of losing solution accuracy. This paper proposes a novel circulant reformulation of the LASSO that lifts the problem to a higher dimension, where ADMM can be efficiently applied to its dual form. Because of this lifting, all optimization variables are updated using only basic element-wise operations, the most computationally expensive of which is a 1D FFT. In this way, there is no need for a linear system solver nor matrix-vector multiplication. Since all operations in our FFTLasso method are element-wise, the subproblems are completely independent and can be trivially parallelized (e.g. on a GPU). The attractive computational properties of FFTLasso are verified by extensive experiments on synthetic and real data and on the face recognition task. They demonstrate that FFTLasso scales much more effectively than a state-of-the-art solver.",2017,2017 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)
Otolith barium profiles verify the timing of settlement in a coral reef fish,"Otolith microstructure has been shown to record valuable information about fishes including age, growth, and the timing of life history transitions, while microchemical analysis can reveal information about environmental history, dispersal, and migration. For the bluehead wrasse Thalassoma bifasciatum, a common coral reef fish on an oceanic island, we examined whether otolith chemistry could be used to identify the timing of settlement from the pelagic larval phase to the reefbased juvenile phase. This species has a distinct settlement mark visible in its otolith microstructure. Using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS), we found that Ba:Ca ratios increased abruptly at the time of settlement. On average, Ba:Ca ratios were 6.5Ã— greater in the juvenile than the larval phase. Other elements (Mg, Mn, and Sr) also displayed ontogenetic changes in concentration; however, those changes were not associated with the settlement mark. We demonstrate the potential utility of otolith chemistry as a method to identify the timing of settlement (and thereby the larval duration) in other marine fishes with similar early life histories, whose otoliths may not produce distinct settlement checks or those whose settlement stage larvae may not be captured by other means.",2009,Marine Ecology Progress Series
Comparison of subset selection methods in linear regression in the context of health-related quality of life and substance abuse in Russia,"BackgroundAutomatic stepwise subset selection methods in linear regression often perform poorly, both in terms of variable selection and estimation of coefficients and standard errors, especially when number of independent variables is large and multicollinearity is present. Yet, stepwise algorithms remain the dominant method in medical and epidemiological research.MethodsPerformance of stepwise (backward elimination and forward selection algorithms using AIC, BIC, and Likelihood Ratio Test, pâ€‰=â€‰0.05 (LRT)) and alternative subset selection methods in linear regression, including Bayesian model averaging (BMA) and penalized regression (lasso, adaptive lasso, and adaptive elastic net) was investigated in a dataset from a cross-sectional study of drug users in St. Petersburg, Russia in 2012â€“2013. Dependent variable measured health-related quality of life, and independent correlates included 44 variables measuring demographics, behavioral, and structural factors.ResultsIn our case study all methods returned models of different size and composition varying from 41 to 11 variables. The percentage of significant variables among those selected in final model varied from 100Â % to 27Â %. Model selection with stepwise methods was highly unstable, with most (and all in case of backward elimination: BIC, forward selection: BIC, and backward elimination: LRT) of the selected variables being significant (95Â % confidence interval for coefficient did not include zero). Adaptive elastic net demonstrated improved stability and more conservative estimates of coefficients and standard errors compared to stepwise. By incorporating model uncertainty into subset selection and estimation of coefficients and their standard deviations, BMA returned a parsimonious model with the most conservative results in terms of covariates significance.ConclusionsBMA and adaptive elastic net performed best in our analysis. Based on our results and previous theoretical studies the use of stepwise methods in medical and epidemiological research may be outperformed by alternative methods in cases such as ours. In situations of high uncertainty it is beneficial to apply different methodologically sound subset selection methods, and explore where their outputs do and do not agree. We recommend that researchers, at a minimum, should explore model uncertainty and stability as part of their analyses, and report these details in epidemiological papers.",2015,BMC Medical Research Methodology
Metabolomic prediction of yield in hybrid rice.,"Rice (Oryza sativa) provides a staple food source for more than 50% of the world's population. An increase in yield can significantly contribute to global food security. Hybrid breeding can potentially help to meet this goal because hybrid rice often shows a considerable increase in yield when compared with pure-bred cultivars. We recently developed a marker-guided prediction method for hybrid yield and showed a substantial increase in yield through genomic hybrid breeding. We now have transcriptomic and metabolomic data as potential resources for prediction. Using six prediction methods, including least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP), stochastic search variable selection, partial least squares, and support vector machines using the radial basis function and polynomial kernel function, we found that the predictability of hybrid yield can be further increased using these omic data. LASSO and BLUP are the most efficient methods for yield prediction. For high heritability traits, genomic data remain the most efficient predictors. When metabolomic data are used, the predictability of hybrid yield is almost doubled compared with genomic prediction. Of the 21Â 945 potential hybrids derived from 210 recombinant inbred lines, selection of the top 10 hybrids predicted from metabolites would lead to a ~30% increase in yield. We hypothesize that each metabolite represents a biologically built-in genetic network for yield; thus, using metabolites for prediction is equivalent to using information integrated from these hidden genetic networks for yield prediction.",2016,The Plant journal : for cell and molecular biology
A Comparative Study of Sidneyâ€™s â€œApology for Poetryâ€ and Shelleyâ€™s â€œA Defense of Poetryâ€,"Sidney and Shelley belong to two different periods of literature. Sidney is a Renaissance model, while Shelly is a Romantic one. The two critics reveal almost certain points of similarities and differences in their understanding of the concept of poetry. Therefore, the paper aims at shedding light on the two concepts. Defending poetry against contemporary attack was the motive shared by both Sidney and Shelley in their essays. Sidney's defence was an answer to the puritan fanatics of the 16th century led by Stephen Lasson in his ""School of Abuse"". The main attack on poetry was on the ground of its immortality. As for Shelley, his retort was to the 19th century thinkers understanding poetry on the ground of its worthlessness. Not only were the motives the same with the two writers but the major arguments are also quite similar. One may note a number of close parallels especially in the areas of:",2009,
A microRNA expression profile for vascular invasion can predict overall survival in hepatocellular carcinoma.,"BACKGROUND
The presence of vascular invasion (VI) in pathology specimens is a well-known unfavorable prognostic factor of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence and overall survival (OS). We investigated the vascular invasion related microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles and potential of prognostic value in HCC.


METHODS
MiRNA and mRNA expression data for HCC were accessed from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). LASSO logistic regression models were used to develop a miRNA-based classifier for predicting VI. The predictive capability was accessed by area under receiver operating characteristics (AUC). Concordance index (C-index) and time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (td-ROC) were used to determine its prognostic value. We validated the predictive and prognostic accuracy of this classifier in an external independent cohort of 127 patients. Functionally relevant targets of miRNAs were determined using miRNA target prediction, experimental validation and correlation of miRNA and mRNA expression data.


RESULTS
A 16-miRNA-based classifier was developed which identified VI accurately, with AUC of 0.731 and 0.727 in TCGA set and validation cohort, respectively. C-index and td-ROC showed that the classifier was able to stratify patients into risk groups strongly associated with OS. When stratified by tumor characteristics, the classifier was still a clinically and statistically significant prognostic model. The predictive and prognostic accuracy of the classifier was confirmed in validation cohort. Vascular invasion related miRNA/target pairs were identified by integrating expression patterns of predicted targets, which were validated in cell lines.


CONCLUSIONS
A multi-miRNA-based classifier developed based on the presence of VI, which could effectively predict OS in HCC.",2017,Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry
Dissolving Hegemony or Changing Trade Pattern? Images of Srivijaya in the Chinese Sources of the Twelfth and Thirteenth Centuries,"Introduction The history of Srivijaya has been one of the most controversial subjects in premodern Southeast Asian history. Among the crucial issues in relation to this subject are the timing and cause of its decline and, in particular, to what extent changes in trade patterns contributed to such a development. Recent scholarship, largely derived from new interpretations of the epigraphical and archaeological findings in Southeast Asia, has contributed much to advance our understanding of this ancient empire. Yet, information available in those sources is still far from adequate to make a conclusive historical judgment. It is thus imperative to re-examine Chinese accounts of Srivijaya in the light of this new scholarship. This paper begins with a brief summary of recent discussions on the decline of Srivijaya in the eleventh century based on local epigraphical evidence, mainly drawn from work by O.W. Wolters and Kenneth Hall. This will be followed by a detailed examination of Chinese materials relevant to the issue. The conclusion will offer some suggestions of how to comprehend discrepancies among these sources. The Srivijayan Hegemony and Its Decline in Southeast Asian Historiography Scholars have established that Srivijaya should be identified with a prosperous Southeast Asian empire known as Shi-li-fo-shi in Tang sources, San-fo-qi in Song sources, and Zabaj or Sribuza in medieval Arabic records. It is believed to have been the dominant maritime power in insular Southeast Asia mentioned in a number of local inscriptions which are dated from the seventh to the twelfth centuries.(1) By the seventh century, it became a thalassocracy in the Straits of Malacca and Sunda, claiming suzerainty over many local Malay polities in both Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula. Strategically situated, it dominated the sea route between China and the Indian Ocean, and hence the lucrative international Nanhai trade.(2) Its capital was first located at Palembang, but might have moved elsewhere after the eleventh century.(3) In terms of hegemony, the Srivijaya empire, or bhumi in Sanskrit, consisted of its ruling house or Maharaja residing in the kraton (palace) of Srivijaya (Palembang) and a number of vassals. These vassals can be further divided into two groups: those ruled by datus located along the upstream and downstream Musi River hinterland, and the peripheral ones at other river-mouth ports in Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula.(4) The Maharaja ruled the former group through a combination of spiritual and material bondage built upon allegiance to the king affirmed by religious oath-taking, and the redistribution of wealth and commodities derived from an international trade that was dominated by royalty. ln rerum, these vassals supported the Srivijayan kraton with exportable forest products, provision of food, and extra manpower for military purposes in times of crisis or conquest.(5) Force may have been a deterrent factor but was not frequently employed. On the contrary, the tributary submission by the peripheral vassals would rely more effectively on military strength, though control through cultural dominance and material benefit must also have been present.(6) Srivijayan naval supremacy is believed to have been established with support not only from the manpower obtained from the Musi River valley, but also from the sea nomads, or orang laut, living on the coast and the offshore islands of southeastern Sumatra. And in order to keep their service and to prevent them from reverting to piracy, it was necessary for the Srivijayan king to monopolize the profits from international trade in insular Southeast Asia so that sufficient wealth could be generated to sustain this system.(7) The trade pattern, which played a decisive role in the Srivijayan hegemony, consisted of three layers: the principal entrepot of Srivijaya (Palembang); sub-regional entrepots; and other lesser ports serving as feeder points. â€¦",1998,Journal of Southeast Asian Studies
