Operative Behandlung der Krallenhand mittels Lassoplastik,"ZusammenfassungOperationszielKorrektur der Krallenstellung der Finger bei Ausfall der intrinsischen Muskulatur z.Â B. bei einer Ulnarisparese.IndikationenKrallenstellung der Finger durch Parese oder Ausfall der Interossei und Lumbricales bei ungestÃ¶rter Funktion der oberflÃ¤chlichen und tiefen Fingerbeuger.KontraindikationenVerlust oder Parese vom N. medianus innervierter Fingerbeuger. Fixierte Streck- und Beugekontraktur der Fingergelenke. Arthrosen oder andere FunktionsstÃ¶rungen der Fingergelenke. Fehlende aktive Beugung und Streckung der Mittel- und Endgelenke bei gestÃ¶rter Gleitfunktion der entsprechenden Sehnen. Relativ: Hohe UlnarislÃ¤hmung mit Ausfall der tiefen Beuger des Klein- und Ringfingers, evtl. auch des Mittelfingers.OperationstechnikAbtrennung der Flexor-digitorum-superficialis-IV-Sehne (FDSÂ IV) distal des Camper-Chiasma. Teilung der Sehne in mehrere Streifen. Einflechtung jedes Sehnenstreifens in den proximalen Teil des A2-Ringbands des betroffenen Fingers. Findet sich eine Krallenstellung aller Finger ist es u.Â U. vorteilhaft, zusÃ¤tzlich zur FDS-IV-Sehne die oberflÃ¤chliche Beugesehne des Mittelfingers zu verwenden, da ansonsten die FDS-IV-Sehne in 4Â Streifen geteilt werden muss, wodurch sehr dÃ¼nne Sehnenstreifen resultieren. Bei Verwendung der FDS-III- und -IV-Sehne werden die beiden Sehnenstreifen aus dem FDSÂ IV zur Lassoplastik am Klein- und Ringerfinger, die Sehnenstreifen des FDSÂ III zur Lassoplastik am Mittel- und Zeigefinger verwendet.WeiterbehandlungRuhigstellung der operierten Finger mittels einer dorsalen Unterarmgipsschiene, die Mittelhand ulnarumgreifend mit Einschluss der Metakarpophalangealgelenke in 70Â°-Beugung. Nach 2Â Wochen Ersatz durch eine thermoplastische Schiene fÃ¼r weitere 4Â Wochen. WÃ¤hrend dieser Zeit krankengymnastische Ãœbungsbehandlung fÃ¼r Finger und Daumen.ErgebnisseVon April 2003 bis Juni 2012 wurden 17Â Patienten (8Â Frauen, 9Â MÃ¤nner) wegen einer Krallenstellung operiert. Die dominante Hand war 7-mal betroffen. Das Durchschnittsalter betrug 46â€‰Â±â€‰15 (22â€“80) Jahre, das Intervall zwischen Eintritt der Ulnarisparese und der Lassoplastik 61â€‰Â±â€‰91 (3â€“288) Monate. Die letzte Nachuntersuchung fand nach 42â€‰Â±â€‰32Â (2â€“112) Monaten statt. Die Krallenstellung konnte bei 14 von 17Â Patienten behoben werden. Die Grobkraft betrug 58â€‰Â±â€‰28â€‰% (11â€“96%) der unverletzten Gegenseite, der DASH-Score 32â€‰Â±â€‰18 (5â€“68) Punkte, die Patientenzufriedenheit 7â€‰Â±â€‰2 (0â€“10) Punkte. Unter BerÃ¼cksichtigung der eigenen Resultate und der Angaben in der Literatur kann die Lassoplastik zur Behandlung der Krallenhand empfohlen werden.AbstractObjectivesThe aim is correction of claw deformity of the fingers by intrinsic paralysis.IndicationsIndications are claw deformity of fingers caused by palsy or functional loss of the interosseus or lumbrical muscles as far as the function of the superficial and deep flexors of the finger is intact.ContraindicationsContraindications are loss or paralysis of finger flexors supplied by the median nerve, fixed extension or flexion contracture of the finger joints, osteoarthritis and other malfunctions of the finger joints, no active flexion and extension of the interphalangeal joints due to compromised tendon gliding. Relative: Upper ulnar nerve palsy with functional loss of the deep flexor of the small and ring finger and possibly of the middle finger.Surgical techniqueThe operation technique involves detachment of the flexor digitorum superficialis IV tendon (FDSÂ IV) distal to Camperâ€™s chiasm, division of the tendon into separate strips, interweaving of each tendon strip into the proximal part of the A2 pulley of the affected fingers. In cases of claw deformity of all fingers it may be advantageous to apply the superficial flexor tendon of the long finger in addition to the FDSÂ IV tendon as otherwise the FDSÂ IV tendon has to be divided into four strips resulting in relatively thin tendon strips. If the FDSÂ III and IV tendons are applied, the two strips of the FDSÂ IV tendon are used for lassoplasty of the small and ring fingers and the FDSÂ III tendon for lassoplasty of the middle and index fingers.Postoperative managementPostoperative management includes immobilization of the operated fingers by a dorsoulnar forearm plaster cast including the metacarpophalangeal joints which are flexed to 70Â°. After 2Â weeks replacement of the cast by a thermoplastic splint for another 4Â weeks. During the whole period exercises for the finger and thumb should be carried out.ResultsFrom April 2003 to June 2012 a total of 17Â patients, 8Â female and 9Â male were surgically treated for claw deformity. The dominant hand was affected in seven patients. The average age was 46â€‰Â±â€‰15 (22â€“80) years, the average interval from onset of ulnar palsy to lassoplasty was 61â€‰Â±â€‰91 (3â€“288) months. The final follow-up was performed after an average of 42â€‰Â±â€‰32 (2â€“112) months. Claw deformity was resolved in 14 out of the 17Â patients. The grip strength was on average 58â€‰Â±â€‰28â€‰% (11â€“96Â %) of the unaffected hand, the mean disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand (DASH) score was 32â€‰Â±â€‰18 (5â€“68) points and the degree of patient satisfaction 7â€‰Â±â€‰2 (0â€“10). According to own results and those in the literature lassoplasty can be recommended for the treatment of claw deformity.",2012,Operative OrthopÃ¤die und Traumatologie
"Carbon outwelling from a mangrove forest with adjacent seagrass beds and coral reefs (Gazi Bay, Kenya)","Carbon fluxes from a mangrove creek with adjacent seagrass meadows and coral reefs (at 4 km from the creek) were investigated in Gazi Bay (Kenya). Analysis of the stable isotope signature of sediment carbon in the seagrass zone and data on the sediment carbon content indicate that outwelling of particulate organic matter (POM) from the mangrove forest occurs, but that deposition of this POM rapidly decreases away from the forest. No evidence for any input of mangrove POM in the seagrass zone was found at a distance of 3 km from the mangrove creek, near the reefs. The gradient in sediment 6I3C values in the seagrass zone was paralleled by a similar gradient of 6I3C values in Thalassodendron ciliatum, the dominant subtidal seagrass. This gradient probably reflects the availability of respiratory CO2 denved from mangrove POM as a carbon source for the seagrass. Analysis of C:N ratios of particulate material (< 1 mm) collected with sediment traps in the seagrass zone yielded values ranging from 8.5 to 11.2. This range is remarkably low compared to C:N ratios of plant matenal produced in the mangrove forest, and suggests that some of the mangrove-derived organic particles deposited in the seagrass zone have gone through a phase of intensive processing. During flood tides conspicuous decreases were found in 6I3C values of seston flowing over the seagrass zone, coinciding with significant increases in the carbon content of the seston. These findings point to a reversed flux of organic particles from the seagrass zone to the mangrove forest. Our data indicate that, as far as POM fluxes are concerned, the mangrove forest and adjacent seagrass meadows are tightly coupled, but that the nearby coral reefs may exist in relative isolation.",1994,Marine Ecology Progress Series

"Present Fisheries Status of Sariakandi Fish Pass, Sariakandi, Bogra","About 12 genera of Osteichthyes fishes were recorded in the Bengali river before establishment of fish pass. The fishes were Labeo rohita (Hamilton), Catla catla (Hamilton), Cirrhinus mrigala (Hamilton) and Puntius sophore (Hamilton) under Cypriniformes; Wallago attu (Bloch and Schneider), Mystus tengara (Hamilton), Ailia coila (Hamilton) of Siluriformes; Colisa fasciata (Bloch and Schneider), Ambasis nama (Hamilton), Glassogobius giuris (Hamilton) of Perciformes; Mugil corsula (Hamilton) of Mugiliformes and Mastacembelus armatus (Lecepede) of Mastacembeliformes. At present in the Bengali river about 23 genera of Osteichthyes comprising of L. rohita, C. catla, L. calbasu, L. bata (Hamilton), C. mrigala, Amblypharyngodon mola (Hamilton), Puntius sophore (Hamilton), Botia dario (Hamilton) of Cypriniformes, Wallago attu, Mystus aor (Hamilton), Rita rita (Hamilton), Pangasius pangasius (Hamilton), M. tengara, M. cavasius (Hamilton), Ailia coila, Ompok pabda (Hamilton) of Siluriformes, Gudusia chapra (Hamilton) of Clupeiformes, Colisa fasciata, Ambasis nama (Hamilton), Glassogobius giuris of Perciformes, Mastacembelus armatus (Lecepede) and M. pancalas (Hamilton) of Mastacembeliformes and Mugil corsula (Hamilton) of Mugiliformes. Belonging to crustacean Macrobrachium lamarrei (DeMan) and M. davanus (Henderson) are available. Now the fishermen capture more fish from the Bengali river and earn more money (about 200-300 Tk/day). They are making semi-paka and paka house and they are using sanitary latrine. The number of school and college-going children of the fisherman family are also increasing. The ecological condition near the fish pass area is degrading year after year. The connecting part of the Jamuna River to the fish pass is becoming high land due to heavy siltation during the rainy season. From the study we may conclude that the fish pass has positive significance on fish diversity and socio-economic development of the fishermen. But the fish pass is going to be inactive due to siltation. So this study recommends overcoming the siltation problem near the fish pass area in future.",2007,Journal of Bio-science

Metal ions induced secondary structure rearrangements: mechanically interlocked lasso vs. unthreaded branched-cyclic topoisomers.,"Metal ions can play a significant role in a variety of important functions in protein systems including cofactor for catalysis, protein folding, assembly, structural stability and conformational change. In the present work, we examined the influence of alkali (Na, K and Cs), alkaline earth (Mg and Ca) and transition (Co, Ni and Zn) metal ions on the conformational space and analytical separation of mechanically interlocked lasso peptides. Syanodin I, sphingonodin I, caulonodin III and microcin J25, selected as models of lasso peptides, and their respective branched-cyclic topoisomers were submitted to native nESI trapped ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry (TIMS-MS). The high mobility resolving power of TIMS permitted to group conformational families regardless of the metal ion. The lower diversity of conformational families for syanodin I as compared to the other lasso peptides supports that syanodin I probably forms tighter binding interactions with metal ions limiting their conformational space in the gas-phase. Conversely, the higher diversity of conformational families for the branched-cyclic topologies further supports that the metal ions probably interact with a higher number of electronegative groups arising from the fully unconstraint C-terminal part. A correlation between the lengths of the loop and the C-terminal tail with the conformational space of lasso peptides becomes apparent upon addition of metal ions. It was shown that the threaded C-terminal region in lasso peptides allows only for distinct interactions of the metal ion with either residues in the loop or tail region. This limits the size of the interacting region and apparently leads to a bias of metal ion binding in either the loop or tail region, depending whichever section is larger in the respective lasso peptide. For branched-cyclic peptides, the non-restricted C-terminal tail allows metal coordination by residues throughout this region, which can result in gas-phase structures that are sometimes even more compact than the lasso peptides. The high TIMS resolution also resulted in the separation of almost all lasso and branched-cyclic topoisomer metal ions (r âˆ¼ 2.1 on average). It is also shown that the metal incorporation (e.g., doubly cesiated species) can lead to the formation of a simplified IMS pattern (or preferential conformers), which results in baseline analytical separation and discrimination between lasso and branched-cyclic topologies using TIMS-MS.",2018,The Analyst
The effects of pre-slaughter handling on reindeer meat quality - a review,"Rangifer tarandus tarandus) are well adapted to a climate characterised by low temperatures and snow during a major part of the year. During the summer, reindeer graze primarily on the green fresh parts of grasses, sedges, shrubs and herbs and in the autumn, gradually shift to a diet consisting mainly of lichens and dwarf shrubs. Reindeer husbandry is an important part of the life and culture of the Saami people in Sweden, Norway, Finland and Russia. During the 20 th century, Swedish reindeer herding became more extensive and the use of all kinds of modern technical equipment was introduced. The pre-slaughter handling of reindeer today includes a mixture of traditional and modern procedures, such as pre-slaughter supplementary feeding, restraint of selected individual animals by the use of a lasso, long distance road transport and industrialised slaughter. There is an increasing awareness of the importance of improving herd productivity among Swedish reindeer herders today. First priorities are to balance the herd size with the pasture resources and change the herd structure towards a high portion of high-producing animals and to adjust pre-slaughter handling routines so that the animals will be exposed to a minimum of stress. These measures will safeguard carcass and meat quality and produce raw material of good quality for further processing. However, it is also important for the reindeer meat industry to acknowledge the impact of the feeding regimen on the quality of fresh as well as processed meat products. This is essential because quality attributes influence consumer preference and consequently the economic viability of the industry.",2004,
Modeling the Probability of Default in the Construction Sector: Factors of Corporate Governance,"In this paper, we have estimated the probability for default in large construction companies in Russia using the classic method for this purpose â€“ logistic regression. Our task incorporates testing corporate governance factors and analyzing the predictive power of the model with regularization (Lasso and Ridge). For the dependent variable, we tested four definitions of default and then compared them. The model was conducted on the basis of information from the SPARK, Rosstat and the Bank of Russia database for the period of 2007-2015 â€“ the final sample, after eliminating the outlying observations, consists of 4761 construction companies. The added value of the corporate governance factors is verified on the basis of comparison of the ROC-curves (AUC) and the I and II errors. Seven hypotheses were formed, some of which were statistically significant, using an assessment based on both international and domestic experience dealing with the influence of corporate structure on the company's stability. In particular, everything else being equal, the default probability of the company will be lower if the CEO is also a co-owner; whereas the default probability of the company will be higher if the company is a subsidiary. Note also, that, in fact, companies with a small board of directors overcome financial distress better (with a negative return on assets) in the Russian construction business. There was no confirmation of the hypothesis that older companies are less likely to default. Confirmed hypotheses give a new perspective to look at with a comprehensive risk assessment of large construction companies in the country. According to our estimates, corporate governance factors really improved the predictive ability of the models, and regularization methods confirmed the stability of these models. Using cross-validation, the robustness of the coefficients of the final specification was confirmed. This result may be of interest to a greater extent for banks, commercial investors and partners-contractors.",2017,
Neighbourhood level real-time forecasting of dengue cases in tropical urban Singapore,"BackgroundDengue, a vector-borne infectious disease caused by the dengue virus, has spread through tropical and subtropical regions of the world. All four serotypes of dengue viruses are endemic in the equatorial city state of Singapore, and frequent localised outbreaks occur, sometimes leading to national epidemics. Vector control remains the primary and most effective measure for dengue control and prevention. The objective of this study is to develop a novel framework for producing a spatio-temporal dengue forecast at a neighbourhoodÂ level spatial resolution that can be routinely used by Singaporeâ€™s government agencies for planning of vector control for best efficiency.MethodsThe forecasting algorithm uses a mixture of purely spatial, purely temporal and spatio-temporal data to derive dynamic risk maps for dengue transmission. LASSO-based regression was used for the prediction models and separate sub-models were constructed for each forecast window. Data were divided into training and testing sets for out-of-sample validation. Neighbourhoods were categorised as high or low risk based on the forecast number of cases within the cell. The predictive accuracy of the categorisation was measured.ResultsClose concordance between the projections and the eventual incidence of dengue were observed. The average Matthewâ€™s correlation coefficient for a classification of the upper risk decile (operational capacity) is similar to the predictive performance at the optimal 30% cut-off. The quality of the spatial predictive algorithm as a classifier shows areas under the curve at all forecast windows being above 0.75 and above 0.80 within the next month.ConclusionsSpatially resolved forecasts of geographically structured diseases like dengue can be obtained at a neighbourhoodÂ level in highly urban environments at a precision that is suitable for guiding control efforts. The same method can be adapted to other urban and even rural areas, with appropriate adjustment to the grid size and shape.",2018,BMC Medicine
Short- and Middle-Latency Somatosensory Evoked Potentials in Callosal Agenesis,"Experimental transection of the corpus callosum in animals and callosotomy practiced in human adults for therapeutic purposes have led to the description of the disconnection syndrome. Typically, adult patients or animals who undergo a callosal section show a permanent deficit in interhemispheric transfer and integration of sensory and motor functions (for reviews, see Sperry et al., 1969; Gazzaniga, 1970). By contrast, few of these deficits are seen in individuals with agenesis of the corpus callosum when there are tested in certain tasks requiring intermanual comparisons. For example, whilst callosotomized patients are unable to cross-match objects held in both hands out of view, acallosal subjects have no difficulties in performing this task although their response times may be longer than in callosally-intact subjects (Ettlinger et al., 1972, 1974; Saul and Gott, 1973; Jeeves, 1979; Sauerwein et al., 1981). The same is true when callosotomy is performed before puberty (Lassonde et al., 1986, 1991).",1994,
Evolution of star clusters with a mass distribution of binaries,"SummaryThe dynamical evolution of star clusters with a initial population of binaries strongly depends on the parameters of the bounded pairs. We performed computational simulation with directN-body codes, on models withN=300 objects, with initial fraction of 20% of binaries with the same orbital semi-axis and with a Salpeter mass spectrum. The results are compared with previous analysis on similar equal-mass star models. The calculation points out that binaries with different mass companions determine an enhanced and sudden expansion of the system with neither core collapse nor central mass segregation.RiassuntoL'evoluzione di un ammasso stellare con una popolazione iniziale di binarie dipende fortemente dai parametri delle coppie presenti. Sono state realizzate dagli autori delle simulazioni al calcolatore su modelli formati daN=300 oggetti, con una percentuale inixiale del 20% di binarie con lo stesso semiasse e con une spettro di massa tipo Salpeter. I risultati sono confrontati con quelli di precedenti simulazioni su modelli similari ma formati da stelle di massa eguale. Le analisi mettono in luce come le binarie formate da compagne di massa differente producono una pronunciata e rapida espansione del sistema senza che si abbia l'usuale collasso della regione interna e pronunciata segregazione della massa.Ð ÐµÐ·ÑŽÐ¼ÐµÐ”Ð¸Ð½Ð°Ð¼Ð¸Ñ‡ÐµÑÐºÐ°Ñ ÑÐ²Ð¾Ð»ÑŽÑ†Ð¸Ñ Ð·Ð²ÐµÐ·Ð´Ð½Ñ‹Ñ… ÐºÐ»Ð°ÑÑ‚ÐµÑ€Ð¾Ð² Ñ Ð½Ð°Ñ‡Ð»ÑŒÐ½Ð¾Ð¹ Ð·Ð°ÑÐµÐ»ÐµÐ½Ð¹ÑÑ‚ÑŠÑŽ, Ñ…Ð°Ñ€Ð°ÐºÑ‚ÐµÑ€Ð½Ð¾Ð¹ Ð´Ð»Ñ Ð´Ð²Ð¾Ð¹Ð½Ñ‹Ñ… Ð·Ð²ÐµqzÐ´, ÑÐ¸Ð»ÑŒÐ½Ð¾ Ð·Ð°Ð²Ð¸ÑÑ‚ Ð¾Ñ‚ Ð¿Ð°Ñ€Ð°Ð¼ÐµÑ‚Ñ€Ð¾Ð² ÑÐ²ÑÐ·Ð¸ Ð¿Ð°Ñ€.

Estimating Exposome Score for Schizophrenia Using Predictive Modeling Approach in Two Independent Samples: The Results From the EUGEI Study.,"Exposures constitute a dense network of the environment: exposome. Here, we argue for embracing the exposome paradigm to investigate the sum of nongenetic ""risk"" and show how predictive modeling approaches can be used to construct an exposome score (ES; an aggregated score of exposures) for schizophrenia. The training dataset consisted of patients with schizophrenia and controls, whereas the independent validation dataset consisted of patients, their unaffected siblings, and controls. Binary exposures were cannabis use, hearing impairment, winter birth, bullying, and emotional, physical, and sexual abuse along with physical and emotional neglect. We applied logistic regression (LR), Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB), the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and Ridge penalized classification models to the training dataset. ESs, the sum of weighted exposures based on coefficients from each model, were calculated in the validation dataset. In addition, we estimated ES based on meta-analyses and a simple sum score of exposures. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, area under the receiver operating characteristic, and Nagelkerke's R2 were compared. The ESMeta-analyses performed the worst, whereas the sum score and the ESGNB were worse than the ESLR that performed similar to the ESLASSO and ESRIDGE. The ESLR distinguished patients from controls (odds ratio [OR] = 1.94, P < .001), patients from siblings (OR = 1.58, P < .001), and siblings from controls (OR = 1.21, P = .001). An increase in ESLR was associated with a gradient increase of schizophrenia risk. In reference to the remaining fractions, the ESLR at top 30%, 20%, and 10% of the control distribution yielded ORs of 3.72, 3.74, and 4.77, respectively. Our findings demonstrate that predictive modeling approaches can be harnessed to evaluate the exposome.",2019,Schizophrenia bulletin
Neural Decoding: A Predictive Viewpoint,"Decoding in the context of brain-machine interface is a prediction problem, with the aim of retrieving the most accurate kinematic predictions attainable from the available neural signals. While selecting models that reduce the prediction error is done to various degrees, decoding has not received the attention that the fields of statistics and machine learning have lavished on the prediction problem in the past two decades. Here, we take a more systematic approach to the decoding prediction problem and search for risk-optimized reverse regression, optimal linear estimation (OLE), and Kalman filter models within a large model space composed of several nonlinear transformations of neural spike counts at multiple temporal lags. The reverse regression decoding framework is a standard prediction problem, where penalized methods such as ridge regression or Lasso are routinely used to find minimum risk models. We argue that minimum risk reverse regression is always more efficient than OLE and also happens to be 44% more efficient than a standard Kalman filter in a particular application of offline reconstruction of arm reaches of a rhesus macaque monkey. Yet model selection for tuning curvesâ€“based decoding models such as OLE and Kalman filtering is not a standard statistical prediction problem, and no efficient method exists to identify minimum risk models. We apply several methods to build low-risk models and show that in our application, a Kalman filter that includes multiple carefully chosen observation equations per neural unit is 67% more efficient than a standard Kalman filter, but with the drawback that finding such a model is computationally very costly.",2017,Neural Computation
Exploration and validation of radiomics signature as an independent prognostic biomarker in stage III-IVb nasopharyngeal carcinoma,"There is no consensus on specific prognostic biomarkers potentially improving survival of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), especially in advanced-stage disease. The prognostic value of MRI-based radiomics signature is unclear. A total of 970 quantitative features were extracted from the tumor of 100 untreated NPC patients (stage III-IVb) (discovery set: n = 70, validation set: n = 30). We then applied least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) regression to select features that were most associated with progression-free survival (PFS). Candidate prognostic biomarkers included age, gender, overall stage, hemoglobin, platelet counts and radiomics signature. We developed model 1 (without radiomics signature) and model 2 (with radiomics signature) in the discovery set and then tested in the validation set. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to yield hazard ratio (HR) of each potential biomarker. We found the radiomics signature stratified patients in the discovery set into a low or high risk group for PFS (HR = 5.14, p < 0.001) and was successfully validated for patients in the validation set (HR = 7.28, p = 0.015). However, the other risk factors showed no significantly prognostic value (all p-values for HR, > 0.05). Accordingly, pretreatment MRI-based radiomics signature is a non-invasive and cost-effective prognostic biomarker in advanced NPC patients, which would improve decision-support in cancer care.",2017,Oncotarget
Integrative analysis of gene expression and DNA methylation through oneâ€class logistic regression machine learning identifies stemness features in medulloblastoma,"Most human cancers develop from stem and progenitor cell populations through the sequential accumulation of various genetic and epigenetic alterations. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been identified from medulloblastoma (MB), but a comprehensive understanding of MB stemness, including the interactions between the tumor immune microenvironment and MB stemness, is lacking. Here, we employed a trained stemness index model based on an existent one-class logistic regression (OCLR) machine-learning method to score MB samples; we then obtained two stemness indices, a gene-expression-based stemness index (mRNAsi) and a DNA-methylation-based stemness index (mDNAsi), to perform an integrated analysis of MB stemness in a cohort of primary cancer samples (n=763). We observed an inverse trend between mRNAsi and mDNAsi for MB subgroup and metastatic status. By applying the univariable Cox regression analysis, we found that mRNAsi significantly correlated with overall survival (OS) for all MB patients, whereas mDNAsi had no significant association with OS for all MB patients. In addition, by combining the Lasso-penalized Cox regression machine learning approach with univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses, we identified a stemness-related gene expression signature that accurately predicted survival in patients with SHH MB. Furthermore, positive correlations between mRNAsi and prognostic copy number aberrations in SHH MB, including MYCN amplifications and GLI2 amplifications, were detected. Analyses of the immune microenvironment revealed unanticipated correlations of MB stemness with infiltrating immune cells. Lastly, using the Connectivity Map (CMap), we identified potential drugs targeting the MB stemness signature. Our findings based on stemness indices might advance the development of objective diagnostic tools for quantitating MB stemness and lead to novel biomarkers that predict the survival of patients with MB or the efficacy of strategies targeting MB stem cells.",2019,Molecular Oncology
Radiomics Analysis on Ultrasound for Prediction of Biologic Behavior in Breast Invasive Ductal Carcinoma,"Microâ€Abstract This study illustrates that tumor characteristics can be captured by medical images at the genetic and cellular levels. The data from 215 patients with breast invasive ductal carcinoma were analyzed. An automatic radiomics approach was proposed to assess the associations between quantitative ultrasound features and biologic characteristics. The results indicated a strong correlation. This application will be helpful for an accurate prognosis at an early stage. Introduction: In current clinical practice, invasive ductal carcinoma is always screened using medical imaging techniques and diagnosed using immunohistochemistry. Recent studies have illustrated that radiomics approaches provide a comprehensive characterization of entire tumors and can reveal predictive or prognostic associations between the images and medical outcomes. To better reveal the underlying biology, an improved understanding between objective image features and biologic characteristics is urgently required. Patients and Methods: A total of 215 patients with definite histologic results were enrolled in our study. The tumors were automatically segmented using our phaseâ€based active contour model. The highâ€throughput radiomics features were designed and extracted using a breast imaging reporting and data system and further selected using Student's t test, interfeature coefficients and a lasso regression model. The support vector machine classifier with threefold crossâ€validation was used to evaluate the relationship. Results: The radiomics approach demonstrated a strong correlation between receptor status and subtypes (P < .05; area under the curve, 0.760). The appearance of hormone receptorâ€positive cancer and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2â€“negative cancer on ultrasound scans differs from that of tripleâ€negative cancer. Conclusion: Our approach could assist clinicians with the accurate prediction of prognosis using ultrasound findings, allowing for early medical management and treatment.",2018,Clinical Breast Cancer
Lasers and space optical systems study,"The Air Force and other government organizations have considered the application of space-based lasers since the early 1970s. Recent studies have identified the enormous potential of lasers and optical systems in space to support the Full-Spectrum Dominance envisioned by the Joint Chiefs of Staff in â€œJoint Vision 2010.â€ The Air Force Research Laboratory has undertaken the LAÂ¯sers and S_pace O_ptical S_ystems (LASSOS) Study to examine in detail how space lasers and optics (defined as any laser system based in space or any terrestrial-based laser whose beam transits space) could best be used to satisfy this critical need. This twelve-month study will identify promising technology concepts for space laser/optic systems, develop system concepts based on these technologies with special emphasis on systems capable of performing multiple missions, assess how well these systems can accomplish operational tasks in a quantitative manner, and design technology development roadmaps for selected concepts.

On the genus Tomaxellia (Coniferae) from the Lower Cretaceous of Patagonia (Argentina) and its male and female cones,"This paper reports the organic attachment of male and female cones to twigs previously described as Tomaxellia biforme Archangelsky. The male cones produce Classopollis pollen, while the scales of the female structures are comparable to the Rhaeto-Liassic northern genus Cheirolepidium. A new interpretation of the possible female cone of Cheirolepidium is presented, based on the new evidence now available with the knowledge of Tomaxellia cones. Other female cones found in Mesozoic formations may be comparable to some extent with Tomaxellia, such as Indostrobus (Cretaceous of India) or Pararaucaria (Jurassic of Argentina), and they may be grouped in the family Cheirolepidiaceae. Comparisons with older conifer genera with known female cones are also included (Voltziaceae). Some morphological changes of the female cones, which probably took place during the Mesozoic (in these particular groups) are also inferred.",1968,Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society
The group k-support norm for learning with structured sparsity,"Several high-dimensional learning applications require the parameters to satisfy a â€œgroup sparsityâ€ constraint, where clusters of coefficients are required to be simultaneously selected or rejected. The group lasso and its variants are common methods to solve problems of this form. Recently, in the standard sparse setting, it has been noted that tighter convex relaxations than the â„“1 norm can be obtained by using other regularizers, leading to better predictive performance. Motivated by these discoveries, we develop the group k-support norm to achieve group sparsity with a better predictive accuracy. We develop an efficient algorithm to solve the resulting optimization problems, and show that our approach outperforms traditional methods for prediction and recovery under group sparsity.",2017,"2017 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)"
Fluoxetine treatment decreases territorial aggression in a coral reef fish,"Serotonin is an important neurotransmitter in the regulation of social interactions in many animals. Correlative studies in numerous vertebrate species, including fishes, indicate that aggressive males have lower relative serotonergic activity than less aggressive males. We used fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, to experimentally enhance serotonergic neurotransmission in a territorial coral reef fish and test the role of this neurotransmitter in mediating aggressive behavior and dominance interactions. The bluehead wrasse, Thalassoma bifasciatum, has a complex social system in which large males aggressively defend spawning territories from intruders. In separate experiments, we tested the effects of chronic and acute fluoxetine treatments on aggressive behavior using a resident-intruder design. In a laboratory experiment, males treated daily with intraperitoneal fluoxetine injections for 2 weeks (6 microg/g bw) displayed fewer intruder chases than saline-treated controls. Chronically fluoxetine-treated males also showed lower levels of activity than saline controls prior to intruder trials. However, activity was not correlated with chases on an individual level, indicating the lower aggression displayed by fluoxetine-treated males was not due solely to general reductions in behavioral display. A field study exposed males to a confined territorial intruder following single intraperitoneal injections of fluoxetine (10 microg/g bw) or saline given to the same individual on different days. The frequency of aggressive chases following acute fluoxetine treatment was significantly lower than that following saline injections. This study experimentally supports the link between serotonin and aggressive behavior in fishes in both a controlled laboratory testing environment and the animal's natural habitat.",2003,Physiology & Behavior
Convex Hull Approximation of Nearly Optimal Lasso Solutions,"In an ordinary feature selection procedure, a set of important features is obtained by solving an optimization problem such as the Lasso regression problem, and we expect that the obtained features explain the data well. In this study, instead of the single optimal solution, we consider finding a set of diverse yet nearly optimal solutions. To this end, we formulate the problem as finding a small number of solutions such that the convex hull of these solutions approximates the set of nearly optimal solutions. The proposed algorithm consists of two steps: First, we randomly sample the extreme points of the set of nearly optimal solutions. Then, we select a small number of points using a greedy algorithm. The experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm can approximate the solution set well. The results also indicate that we can obtain Lasso solutions with a large diversity.",2019,

Soziale Aspekte von EinsÃ¤tzen im Rettungsdienst,"ZusammenfassungHintergrundViele EinsÃ¤tze in der prÃ¤klinischen Notfallrettung erscheinen den Rettern als â€žFehleinsÃ¤tzeâ€œ oder falsche Indikationen im Sinne der Landesrettungsgesetze. Solche EinsÃ¤tze werden oftmals durch soziale Aspekte getriggert, oder diese stehen gar im Vordergrund des Einsatzes. Mitarbeiter der Rettungsdienste werden mit sozialen Problemen konfrontiert und fÃ¼hlen sich in der Folge hÃ¤ufig damit allein gelassen.Ziel der ArbeitDer vorliegende Beitrag fÃ¶rdert das VerstÃ¤ndnis der Rettungsdienstmitarbeiter fÃ¼r die ZusammenhÃ¤nge zwischen gesellschaftlichen Problemen und Gesundheit. FÃ¼r hÃ¤ufige soziale NotfÃ¤lle im Rettungsdienst werden LÃ¶sungsstrategien angeboten.Material und MethodeIn dieser Arbeit werden ZusammenhÃ¤nge zwischen sozioÃ¶konomischem Status und Gesundheit bzw. Krankheit aufgezeigt. Typische Einsatzindikationen, bei denen soziale Aspekte eine groÃŸe Rolle spielen, werden dargestellt und LÃ¶sungsstrategien fÃ¼r das Vorgehen vorgeschlagen. Diskutiert wird der Umgang mit FÃ¤llen von Kindesmisshandlung und hÃ¤uslicher Gewalt. Drei klassische psychiatrische Problematiken mit hÃ¤ufig sozialer Komponente werden erÃ¶rtert: psychomotorische ErregungszustÃ¤nde, Suizide und alkoholassoziierte EinsÃ¤tze. Hier wird besonders auf FremdgefÃ¤hrdung und aggressive Patienten eingegangen. Gerade bei Ã¤lteren und chronisch-kranken Patienten spielen neben der Behandlung medizinischer Fragen soziale Probleme eine wichtige Rolle.Ergebnisse und SchlussfolgerungDie MÃ¶glichkeiten des Rettungsteams zur LÃ¶sung sozialer Probleme sind in aller Regel stark begrenzt. Es ist fÃ¼r den Notarzt jedoch wichtig, die Strukturen und nichtmedizinischen Ansprechpartner in der eigenen Region zu kennen und zielgerichtet an sie zu verweisen. Dazu gehÃ¶ren Sozialdienste, JugendÃ¤mter; Kriseninterventionsteams oder beispielsweise sozialpsychiatrische Dienste.AbstractBackgroundMany missions in the preclinical emergency services seem to be triggered by false indications as defined by the Federal State Rescue Act. These emergency calls are often a result of or associated with social issues. Emergency rescue personnel are confronted with social problems and as a result often feel left alone with the problem.AimThis article promotes the understanding of emergency service personnel for the associations between social problems and health. Solution strategies for frequent social emergencies are described.Material and methodsThis article demonstrates the associations between socioeconomic status, health and disease. Typical indications for missions in which social aspects play an important role are presented and solution strategies for the approach are suggested. A discussion is presented on how to deal with cases of child abuse and domestic violence. Three classical psychiatric problem areas with common social components are explained: psychomotor state of excitation, suicide and alcohol-associated incidents and special attention is paid to danger to third parties and aggressive patients. In addition to the treatment of medical conditions, social problems play an important role particularly for the elderly and chronically ill patients.Results and conclusionEmergency personnel have only limited options for dealing with such problems; however, it is important to be aware of regional structures and non-medical organizations, which might be of help in such situations. These include social services, youth welfare services, crisis interventions teams and social psychiatric services.",2015,Der Anaesthesist

Cfd Modelling of the Effect of Fillets on Fin Drag,"This paper describes work being done at Swansea University on the design of wave riding surfboards, with preliminary emphasis on the stabilising fins. Two specific CAD (Computer Aided Design) tools are being developed, one for surfboard design and the other for fin design, both of which allow export of NURB (Non-Uniform, Rational, B-spline) surface geometry in the IGES (Initial Graphics Exchange Specification) format. The fin design tool has the capability of allowing different National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) foils series to be set at separate cross-sections along the fin. Fins and surfboard/fin combinations can be imported directly into the CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) package FLUENT and with careful consideration of surfing dynamics to obtain values of critical flow variables, estimates have been obtained of the pressure and friction drag forces, which are thought to correspond to those occurring in practice and will be validated experimentally at a later stage. These results, however, have already been used to examine a number of disputes in the manufacturing industry, one of which is whether glasson fins induce more or less drag than equivalent fins fixed to the board by a box. This component of the research is just a small part of the larger objective which is to bring scientific and engineering advances into the design and manufacture of surfboards. As the project progresses, CFD will be used to resolve more complex drag components, such as wave drag (free surfaces), induced (vortex) drag and cavitational drag, as well as being coupled to a finite element stress analysis to optimize flexural properties of boards and fins. ADDITIONAL INDEX WORDS: Computer Aided Design (CAD), Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), Surfboard Design, Fins, Wave Riding, Drag Coefficients, National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) foils INTRODUCTION Lengths of surfboards typically range from 1.5m (5â€™0) to 2.7m (9â€™0), depending on the type of waves for which they are intended to be ridden, with smaller boards generally used in smaller waves.

New Evidence of Marine Fauna Tropicalization off the Southwestern Iberian Peninsula (Southwest Europe),"Climate change and the overall increase of seawater temperature are causing a poleward shift in species distribution, which includes a phenomenon described as the tropicalization of temperate regions. This work aims to report the first records of four species off the southwestern Iberian Peninsula, namely, the oceanic puffer Lagocephalus lagocephalus (Linnaeus, 1758), the Madeira rockfish Scorpaena maderensis Valenciennes, 1833, the ornate wrasse Thalassoma pavo (Linnaeus, 1758), and the bearded fireworm Hermodice carunculata (Pallas, 1766). These last three species, along with other occurrences of aquatic fauna and flora along the Portuguese coast, reveal an ongoing process of poleward expansion of several species, which urgently necessitates a comprehensive survey along the entire Iberian Peninsula. The putative origins of these subtropical and tropical species off continental Portugal are discussed, as well as the potential public health problems that two of the four reported species may cause.",2019,Diversity
Grouped gene selection and multi-classification of acute leukemia via new regularized multinomial regression.,"Diagnosing acute leukemia is the necessary prerequisite to treating it. Multi-classification on the gene expression data of acute leukemia is help for diagnosing it which contains B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BALL), T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (TALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, selecting cancer-causing genes is a challenging problem in performing multi-classification. In this paper, weighted gene co-expression networks are employed to divide the genes into groups. Based on the dividing groups, a new regularized multinomial regression with overlapping group lasso penalty (MROGL) has been presented to simultaneously perform multi-classification and select gene groups. By implementing this method on three-class acute leukemia data, the grouped genes which work synergistically are identified, and the overlapped genes shared by different groups are also highlighted. Moreover, MROGL outperforms other five methods on multi-classification accuracy.",2018,Gene
Prediction of clinical foot characteristics using quantitative features from different measurement set-ups,"We measured 77 healthy subjects without major foot deformities. They were all clinically assessed by 10 experts (orthopedic technologists, podiatrists, and one orthopedic surgeon), hence a total of 770 assessments. Furthermore, an anamnesis was conducted, and gait of all subjects was quantitatively measured using three-dimensional (3D) motion analysis (Codamotion), dynamic pressure plate (RSScan International), a dynamic 3D scanner (ViALUX), and a force plate (AMTI). To identify those clinical characteristics, which are robust over the different experts, we conducted a 2agreement weighted kappa analysis which is an extension of Cohenâ€™s kappa for multiple raters (Warrens, 2012). Furthermore, we included both the popularity and the discriminative power of a characteristic (i.e. how many experts scored it and how diverse are the scores, respectively.). We included these last two elements because if either popularity or discriminative power are low, we cannot say much about a certain feature, e.g. if it is evaluated by only one or two experts, or if all subjects get the same score. In a second part, we used the quantitatively extracted features (from the pressure plate, 3D motion analysis, dynamic 3D scanner, and force plate) to predict the average expert scores, for each clinical characteristic individually. To determine the best feature subset, we carried out a feature selection using the Lasso technique in a 10-fold cross validation. The feature subset was then fed to a support vector machine (SVM) classifier which trained a prediction model using a leave-one-out crossvalidation. Finally, from these data we can give an indication which hardware is best to predict foot characteristics. To this end, we built the SVM model only including features from one or a limited set of measurement equipment. In this abstract, we highlight three cases: prediction of the resting calcaneal stance position (RCSP), pressure of the midfoot during stance, and the ratio of the forefoot/heel width.",2015,Footwear Science
Effects of Mango Wastes-Based Diets on the Growing Parameters of Laying Hens and Biometric Parameters of the Eggs,"Introduction: Poultry production has increased during the past half century throughout the world. In Burkina Faso modern poultry farming is becoming a necessity in view of the growing demand for eggs. Intensive poultry farming is developing rapidly, given that the productivity of local poultry remains very low Because of the low availability and high cost of food. Therefore, it becomes imperative to develop strategies to make modern poultry farming more productive, by finding alternative solutions for feeds. Objective: The study aims to evaluate the effects of diets incorporating mango waste-based feed on the growth parameters of laying hens and biometric parameters of first eggs. Methods: Two hundred and ten (10) hens of the Isa Brown breed were divided into 3 batches (70 chicks per set) and feed with three diets namely mango and maize diet (MMD = lot1), control maize diet (CMD = lot2) and absolute control diet (ACD = lot3) in a feed experiment at INERA research station in Farako-ba, Bobo Dioulasso. Results: The final average weight (FW) gained by the lot1 and lot3 using the diet CMD (1364 Â± 114 g) and ACD (1364 Â± 115 g), respectively was significantly higher than the lot 2 feed with the MMD diet (1265 Â± 117 g) (p 0.05). Average weight and egg density were similar (p > 0.05) for the three diets. The eggs on the MMD diet were larger (p 0.05). Conclusion: Maize can be substituted with mango feed in growing layer diets. Mango waste-based feed is predisposed for better preparation of growing layers for good laying performances. It is an alternative to increase the availability of feed for farm animals including the laying hen.",2019,Open Access Library Journal

ImmunoScore Signature: A Prognostic and Predictive Tool in Gastric Cancer,"Objective: We postulated that the ImmunoScore (IS) could markedly improve the prediction of postsurgical survival and chemotherapeutic benefits in gastric cancer (GC). Summary Background Data: A prediction model for GC patients was developed using data from 879 consecutive patients. Methods: The expression of 27 immune features was detected in 251 specimens by using immunohistochemistry, and a 5-feature-based ISGC was then constructed using the LASSO Cox regression model. Testing and validation cohorts were included to validate the model. Results: Using the LASSO model, we established an ISGC classifier based on 5 features: CD3invasive margin (IM), CD3center of tumor (CT), CD8IM, CD45ROCT, and CD66bIM. Significant differences were found between the high-ISGC and low-ISGC patients in the training cohort in 5-year disease-free survival (45.0% vs. 4.4%, respectively; P <0.001) and 5-year overall survival (48.8% vs. 6.7%, respectively; P <0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that the ISGC classifier was an independent prognostic factor. A combination of ISGC and tumor, node, and metastasis (TNM) had better prognostic value than TNM stage alone. Further analysis revealed that stage II and III GC patients with high-ISGC exhibited a favorable response to adjuvant chemotherapy. Finally, we constructed 2 nomograms to predict which patients with stages II and III GC might benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery. Conclusions: The ISGC classifier could effectively predict recurrence and survival of GC, and complemented the prognostic value of the TNM staging system. Moreover, the ISGC might be a useful predictive tool to identify stage II and III GC patients who would benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy.",2018,Annals of Surgery

Semi-parametric segmentation of multiple series using a DP-Lasso strategy,"ABSTRACT We consider a semi-parametric approach to perform the joint segmentation of multiple series sharing a common functional part. We propose an iterative procedure based on Dynamic Programming for the segmentation part and Lasso estimators for the functional part. Our Lasso procedure, based on the dictionary approach, allows us to both estimate smooth functions and functions with local irregularity, which permits more flexibility than previous proposed methods. This yields to a better estimation of the functional part and improvements in the segmentation.

Social Stratification and Exchange in West African Conditions: A Participatory Approach to the Classification of Producers and Net Consumers of Marketed Surplus,"Indian empirical research on the marketed surplus has revealed significant differences in supply response, and in the quantity, timing, intermediary, physical site, and contractual forms of crop transactions according to agrarian class positions (see Sarkar, 1981, for North India; Nadkarni, 1980, for Central India; Bohle, 1985; Harriss et al., 1984 for South India). In the absence of any systematic data, the investigation of these properties of exchange in most African countries requires original field surveys. Furthermore, schemas of class based on, say, Indian conditions of land ownership, or labour relations and/or surplus appropriation, are not relevant to many African conditions, where land frontiers have not been reached, land ownership is rarely privatised and the division of labour in agricultural production and marketplace trade is primarily structured by gender (Meillassoux, 1981; Robson, Chapter 13 in this volume). A farmer may be male or female. Even where, as here, a farm household head is invariably male, the household may contain more than one farmer. Even a differentiating criterion such as â€˜wealthâ€™ is not a simple function of farm size. Rather, it is a conglomerate of several criteria. To discover a set of locally relevant wealth criteria prior to a socially disaggregated study of the marketed surplus and exchange relations, a participatory approach was used experimentally. In the account that follows, experience from fourteen villages of Atlantic Province, Benin is described.",1999,
Predicting serum vitamin D concentrations based on self-reported lifestyle factors and personal attributes.,"Evidence supports the role of vitamin D in various conditions of development and ageing. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) is the best indicator for current vitamin D status. However, the cost of its measurement can be prohibitive in epidemiological research. We developed and validated multivariable regression models that quantified the relationships between vitamin D determinants, measured through an in-person interview, and serum 25(OH)D concentrations. A total of 200 controls participating in a population-based case-control study in Montreal, Canada, provided a blood specimen and completed an in-person interview on socio-demographic, reproductive, medical and lifestyle characteristics and personal attributes. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were quantified by liquid chromatography-tandem MS. Multivariable least squares regression was used to build models that predict 25(OH)D concentrations from interview responses. We assessed high-order effects, performed sensitivity analysis using the lasso method and conducted cross-validation of the prediction models. Prediction models were built for users and non-users of vitamin D supplements separately. Among users, alcohol intake, outdoor time, sun protection, dose of supplement use, menopausal status and recent vacation were predictive of 25(OH)D concentrations. Among non-users, BMI, sun sensitivity, season and recent vacation were predictive of 25(OH)D concentrations. In cross-validation, 46-47 % of the variation in 25(OH)D concentrations were explained by these predictors. In the absence of 25(OH)D measures, our study supports that predicted 25(OH)D scores may be used to assign exposure in epidemiological studies that examine vitamin D exposure.",2018,The British journal of nutrition
Voluntary HIV testing and risky sexual behaviours among health care workers: a survey in rural and urban Burkina Faso,"BackgroundVoluntary counselling and testing (VCT) together with a safe sexual behaviour is an important preventive strategy in the control of HIV. Although Health care workers (HCWs) are critical in the response to HIV, little is known about VCT and high risk behaviours (HRB) among this group in West Africa. This study aims to assess the prevalence of VCT and HRB among HCWs in Burkina Faso.MethodsWe collected data through a questionnaire in urban areas (Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso) and rural areas (Poni and Yatenga) among HCWs from 97 health care facilities. Urine samples were collected, screened for HIV using a CalypteÂ® test kit and confirmed by Western Blot. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with the use of VCT services and with high-risk sex behaviour.ResultsAbout 92.5% of eligible HCWs participated (1570 out of 1697). Overall, 38.2% of them (34.6% of women and 42.6% of men) had ever used VCT services. About 40% of HCWs reported that fear of knowing the test result was the main reason for not doing the HIV test. Male HCWs (pâ€‰=â€‰0.001), laboratory workers (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), those having two years or more experience (pâ€‰=â€‰0.03), and those who had multiple partners (pâ€‰=â€‰0.001) were more likely to have tested for HIV. One fifth of HCWs reported multiple partners. Of these, thirteen percent did not use condoms. HCWs who had multiple partners were significantly more likely to be men, single, living in rural areas, and under the age of 29Â years.ConclusionVCT was still very low among HCWs in Burkina Faso, while HRB was high.These findings suggest that â€˜HCW-friendlyâ€™ VCT centres should be implemented, securing confidentiality among colleagues. In addition, refreshment courses on HIV risk reduction, counselling and testing are certainly required during the professional career of HCWs.",2013,BMC Public Health
AB0766 Bakers' Cyst and Tibiofemoral Abnormalities Are More Distinctive MRI Features of Symptomatic Osteoarthritis than Patellofemoral Abnormalities,"Background In knee osteoarthritis (OA) structural abnormalities can be present in all joint tissues and compartments. These abnormalities are not OA specific and co-occur in different joint locations. Which structural abnormalities can identify symptomatic OA is unclear. Objectives We investigated magnetic resonance (MR) abnormalities in the knee that can discriminate best between individuals with and without symptomatic OA. Methods The Netherlands Epidemiology of Obesity (NEO) study is a population-based cohort including 6671 individuals aged 45â€“65 years, of which 1284 participated in a MR imaging sub-study. Structural abnormalities (osteophytes, cartilage loss, bone marrow lesions (BMLs), subchondral cysts, meniscal abnormalities, effusion, Baker9s cyst) at 9 patellofemoral and tibiofemoral locations were scored using the knee OA scoring system. Symptomatic OA in the imaged knee was defined following the ACR criteria. The relation between structural abnormalities on different locations within the joint was visualized by network graphs, constructed using R, by estimating a sparse inverse covariance matrix using a lasso penalty, based on the pooled variance-covariance matrix across the entire study population. Logistic ridge regression analyses using a double cross-validatory approach were used to investigate which MR abnormalities discriminate best between individuals with and without symptomatic OA, taking co-occurrence of all abnormalities into account. Higher regression coefficients reflect better discrimination between presence or absence of symptomatic OA. Analyses were performed crude and adjusted for age, sex and BMI. Results In the sub-study (55% women, median age 56 years (IQR 50â€“61), BMI 30.0 kg/m 2 (27.9â€“33.0)) 177 participants had symptomatic knee OA. All MR abnormalities except for subchondral cysts were highly frequent both in individuals with and without OA. The network graphs showed relations between osteophytes within all compartments of the knee and between cartilage defects on different locations. Within the same compartment, osteophytes and cartilage defects were related. Baker9s cysts showed the highest regression coefficient (0.293) for presence of symptomatic OA, followed by osteophytes and BMLs in the medial tibiofemoral compartment (0.185â€“0.279), osteophytes in the medial trochlear facet (0.262), and effusion (0.197). After adjustment for age, sex and BMI, the same abnormalities identified OA best. The area under the curve of the logistic ridge regression model including all assessed abnormalities was approximately 0.7. The figure illustrates which abnormalities best identify symptomatic OA (A: Baker9s cyst, effusion, osteophyte in medial trochlear facet, B: osteophytes in medial femoral condyle and medial tibial plateau, C: BMLs in medial femoral condyle and medial tibial plateau). Conclusions Baker9s cysts discriminate best between individuals with and without symptomatic knee OA. Especially structural abnormalities as osteophytes and BMLs in the medial side of the tibiofemoral joint and effusion add further in discriminating symptomatic OA. Presence of Baker9s cysts may present as a target for treatment. Disclosure of Interest None declared",2016,Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases
Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator type methods for the identification of serum biomarkers of overweight and obesity: simulation and application,"BackgroundThe study of circulating biomarkers and their association with disease outcomes has become progressively complex due to advances in the measurement of these biomarkers through multiplex technologies. The Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) is a data analysis method that may be utilized for biomarker selection in these high dimensional data. However, it is unclear which LASSO-type method is preferable when considering data scenarios that may be present in serum biomarker research, such as high correlation between biomarkers, weak associations with the outcome, and sparse number of true signals. The goal of this study was to compare the LASSO to five LASSO-type methods given these scenarios.MethodsA simulation study was performed to compare the LASSO, Adaptive LASSO, Elastic Net, Iterated LASSO, Bootstrap-Enhanced LASSO, and Weighted Fusion for the binary logistic regression model. The simulation study was designed to reflect the data structure of the population-based Tucson Epidemiological Study of Airway Obstructive Disease (TESAOD), specifically the sample size (Nâ€‰=â€‰1000 for total population, 500 for sub-analyses), correlation of biomarkers (0.20, 0.50, 0.80), prevalence of overweight (40%) and obese (12%) outcomes, and the association of outcomes with standardized serum biomarker concentrations (log-odds ratioâ€‰=â€‰0.05â€“1.75). Each LASSO-type method was then applied to the TESAOD data of 306 overweight, 66 obese, and 463 normal-weight subjects with a panel of 86 serum biomarkers.ResultsBased on the simulation study, no method had an overall superior performance. The Weighted Fusion correctly identified more true signals, but incorrectly included more noise variables. The LASSO and Elastic Net correctly identified many true signals and excluded more noise variables. In the application study, biomarkers of overweight and obesity selected by all methods were Adiponectin, Apolipoprotein H, Calcitonin, CD14, Complement 3, C-reactive protein, Ferritin, Growth Hormone, Immunoglobulin M, Interleukin-18, Leptin, Monocyte Chemotactic Protein-1, Myoglobin, Sex Hormone Binding Globulin, Surfactant Protein D, and YKL-40.ConclusionsFor the data scenarios examined, choice of optimal LASSO-type method was data structure dependent and should be guided by the research objective. The LASSO-type methods identified biomarkers that have known associations with obesity and obesity related conditions.",2016,BMC Medical Research Methodology
Efficient Forecasting of Electricity Spot Prices with Expert and LASSO Models,"Recent electricity price forecasting (EPF) studies suggest that the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) leads to well performing models that are generally better than those obtained from other variable selection schemes. By conducting an empirical study involving datasets from two major power markets (Nord Pool and PJM Interconnection), three expert models, two multi-parameter regression (called baseline ) models and four variance stabilizing transformations combined with the seasonal component approach, we discuss the optimal way of implementing the LASSO. We show that using a complex baseline model with nearly 400 explanatory variables, a well chosen variance stabilizing transformation (asinh or N-PIT), and a procedure that recalibrates the LASSO regularization parameter once or twice a day indeed leads to significant accuracy gains compared to the typically considered EPF models. Moreover, by analyzing the structures of the best LASSO-estimated models, we identify the most important explanatory variables and thus provide guidelines to structuring better performing models.",2018,Energies
Combined performance of screening and variable selection methods in ultra-high dimensional data in predicting time-to-event outcomes,"BackgroundBuilding prognostic models of clinical outcomes is an increasingly important research task and will remain a vital area in genomic medicine. Prognostic models of clinical outcomes are usually built and validated utilizing variable selection methods and machine learning tools. The challenges, however, in ultra-high dimensional space are not only to reduce the dimensionality of the data, but also to retain the important variables which predict the outcome. Screening approaches, such as the sure independence screening (SIS), iterative SIS (ISIS), and principled SIS (PSIS), have been developed to overcome the challenge of high dimensionality. We are interested in identifying important single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and integrating them into a validated prognostic model of overall survival in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. While the abovementioned variable selection approaches have theoretical justification in selecting SNPs, the comparison and the performance of these combined methods in predicting time-to-event outcomes have not been previously studied in ultra-high dimensional space with hundreds of thousands of variables.MethodsWe conducted a series of simulations to compare the performance of different combinations of variable selection approaches and classification trees, such as the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (ALASSO), and random survival forest (RSF), in ultra-high dimensional setting data for the purpose of developing prognostic models for a time-to-event outcome that is subject to censoring. The variable selection methods were evaluated for discrimination (Harrellâ€™s concordance statistic), calibration, and overall performance. In addition, we applied these approaches to 498,081 SNPs from 623 Caucasian patients with prostate cancer.ResultsWhen nâ€‰=â€‰300, ISIS-LASSO and ISIS-ALASSO chose all the informative variables which resulted in the highest Harrellâ€™s c-index (>â€‰0.80). On the other hand, with a small sample size (nâ€‰=â€‰150), ALASSO performed better than any other combinations as demonstrated by the highest c-index and/or overall performance, although there was evidence of overfitting. In analyzing the prostate cancer data, ISIS-ALASSO, SIS-LASSO, and SIS-ALASSO combinations achieved the highest discrimination with c-index of 0.67.ConclusionsChoosing the appropriate variable selection method for training a model is a critical step in developing a robust prognostic model. Based on the simulation studies, the effective use of ALASSO or a combination of methods, such as ISIS-LASSO and ISIS-ALASSO, allows both for the development of prognostic models with high predictive accuracy and a low risk of overfitting assuming moderate sample sizes.",2018,Diagnostic and Prognostic Research
"Simultaneous Analysis of Lasso and Dantzig Selector1 by Peter J. Bickel, Yaâ€™acov Ritov","We show that, under a sparsity scenario, the Lasso estimator and the Dantzig selector exhibit similar behavior.

On the Limit Imbalanced Logistic Regression by Binary Predictors,"In this work, we introduce a modified (rescaled) likelihood for imbalanced logistic regression. This new approach makes easier the use of exponential priors and the computation of lasso regularization path. Precisely, we study a limiting behavior for which class imbalance is artificially increased by replication of the majority class observations. If some strong overlap conditions are satisfied, the maximum likelihood estimate converges towards a finite value close to the initial one (intercept excluded) as shown by simulations with binary predictors. This solution corresponds to the extremum of a concave function that we refer to as ""rescaled"" likelihood. In this context, the use of exponential priors has a clear interpretation as a shift on the predictor means for the minority class. Thanks to the simple binary structure, some random designs give analytic path estimators for the lasso regularization problem. An effective approximate path algorithm by piecewise logarithmic functions based on matrix inversions is also presented. This work was motivated by its potential application to spontaneous reports databases in a pharmacovigilance context.",2017,arXiv: Methodology
Inferring nonlinear and sparse gene regulatory networks,"Background and Objectives: Gene regulatory networks model the interactions among the genes and provide a decision rule describing activation and repression of each gene via various proteins. In order to be able to capture the complex gene interactions efficiently, it is imperative to develop algorithms that model the nonlinear interactions among the genes. This work considers the problem of inferring gene regulatory networks using time series data. A nonlinear model is assumed for the gene expression profiles, whereas the microarray data follows a linear Gaussian model. Methods: A particle filter based approach is proposed to estimate the gene expression profiles and the parameters are estimated online using the Kalman filter. In order to capture the inherent sparsity of gene networks, a least squares shrinkage selection operator (LASSO) based regression and model selection algorithm is proposed. Results: The performance of the aforementioned algorithm is rigorously evaluated for synthetic as well as real biological data sets arising from Drosophila melanogaster time series gene expression profiles. The results are contrasted with those reported in the literature. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with the extended Kalman filter (EKF) algorithm using mean square error (MSE) as the fidelity criterion. The proposed algorithm is observed to outperform the EKF in the scenarios considered. Conclusions: This work considered the problem of modeling and learning of gene regulatory networks using a nonlinear dynamical model. This represents a quite general modeling set-up. The gene network is modeled using a state space approach, and particle filtering is used for state estimation. The parameters regulating the interaction among genes are supplied by an online Kalman filter. Since the parameter vector is sparse, LASSO identifies the subset of these parameters pertaining to the relevant system coefficients. Extensive performance evaluations demonstrate that the proposed particle filter based approach outperforms EKF in terms of MSE.",2012,

Bayesian Analysis for miRNA and mRNA Interactions Using Expression Data,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNA molecules composed of 19-22 nt playing important regulatory roles in post-transcriptional gene regulation by inhibiting the translation of the mRNA into proteins or otherwise cleaving the target mRNA. Inferring miRNA targets provides useful information for understanding the roles of miRNA involving in biological processes which may result in diagnosing complex diseases. Statistical methodologies of point estimates such as the LASSO algorithm have been proposed to identify the interactions of miRNA and mRNA based on sequence and expression data. In this paper, we propose Bayesian LASSO and non-negative Bayesian LASSO to analyze the interactions between miRNA and mRNA using the expression data. The proposed Bayesian methods explore the posterior distributions for those parameters required in the model depicting the miRNA-mRNA interactions. For comparison purposes, we applied the Least Square Regression (LSR), Ridge Regression (RR), LASSO, non-negative LASSO (nLASSO), and the Bayesian approaches to four public data sets which have the known interaction pairs of miRNA and mRNA. Comparing to the point estimate algorithms, the Bayesian methods are able to infer more known interactions and are more meaningful to provide credible intervals to take into account the uncertainty of the interactions of miRNA and mRNA. The Bayesian approaches are useful for graphing the inferred eects of the miRNAs on the targets by plotting the posterior distributions of those parameters, and while the point estimate algorithm only provides a single estimate for those parameters.",2012,ArXiv
A novel method of DOA tracking by penalized least squares,"This work develops a new DOA tracking technique by proposing a novel semi-parametric method of sequential sparse recovery for a dynamic sparsity model. The proposed method iteratively provides a sequence of spatial spectrum estimates. The final process of estimating direction paths from the spectrum sequence is not considered. However, the simulation results show concentration of the spectrum around the true directions, which simplifies DOA tracking, for example, using a pattern recognition approach. We have also proved analytical results indicating consistency in terms of spectral concentration, which we omit in the interest of space and postpone to a more extensive work. The semi-parametric nature of the proposed method avoids highly complex data association and makes the method robust against crossing. The computational complexity per time sample is proportional to grid size, which can be contrasted to a single-snapshot LASSO solution that has a polynomial complexity order.",2013,2013 5th IEEE International Workshop on Computational Advances in Multi-Sensor Adaptive Processing (CAMSAP)
Linear Contextual Transformations,"This paper considers groups of musical contextual transformations, the most famous of which is the group of â€œneo-Riemannianâ€ transformations acting on the set of major and minor triads. David Lewin (1982, 1987) first described neo-Riemannian transformations, building on work by von Oettingen (1866) and Hugo Riemann (1880). In general, contextual transformations act on multisets of pitches or pitch classes and commute with transposition and inversion. Music theorists have studied contextual transformation groups extensively; in particular, Lewin (1987), Kochavi (1998), Cohn (1997), and Fiore and Satyendra (2005) used discrete group theory, while Clough (1998) and Gollin (1998) modeled contextual transformations with symmetries of discrete geometric spaces. We represent contextual transformations as linear transformations acting on sequences of pitches or pitch classes belonging to the continuous geometric voiceleading spaces developed by Callender, Quinn, and Tymoczko (2008). Subtleties arise that have not been explored in discrete models. Connections to tuning theory, neo-Riemannian theory, serial transformations, and musical examples from di Lasso, Brahms, and Schubert demonstrate the benefits of this approach.",2009,
Structure learning with large sparse undirected graphs and its applications,"Learning the structures of large undirected graphical models from data is an active research area and has many potential applications in various domains, including molecular biology, social science, marketing data analysis, among others. The estimated structures provide semantic clarity, the possibility of causal interpretation, and ease of integration with a variety of tools. For example, one very important direction in system biology is to discover gene regulatory networks from microarray data (together with other data sources) based on the observed mRNA levels of thousands of genes under various conditions. The basic assumption is that if two genes are co-regulated by the same proteins, then they tend to have similar patterns at the mRNA levels. Thus it is possible to learn a gene regulatory network from microarray data if we treat each gene as a node variable and each condition as a configuration instance. 
Structure learning for undirected graphs is an open challenge in machine learning. Most probabilistic structure learning approaches enforce sparsity on the estimated structure by penalizing the number of edges in the graph, which leads to a non-convex optimization problem. Thus these approaches have to search for locally optimal solutions through the combinatorial space of structures, which makes them unscalable for large graphs. Furthermore, the local optimal solution they find could be far away from the global optimal solution, especially when the number of configuration instances is small compared with the number of nodes in the graph. 
This thesis tries to address these issues by developing a novel structure learning approach that can learn large undirected graphs efficiently in a probabilistic framework. We use the Graphical Gaussian Model (GGM) as the underlying model and propose a novel ARD style Wishart prior for the precision matrix of the GGM, which encodes the graph structure we want to learn. With this prior, we can get the MAP estimation of the precision matrix by solving a modified version of Lasso regression and thus achieve a global optimal sparse solution. By proposing a generalized version of Lasso regression, which is called the Feature Vector Machine (FVM), our structure learning model is further extended so that it can capture non-linear dependencies between node variables. In particular, the optimization problem in our model remains convex even in non-linear cases, which makes our solution globally optimal. We have also developed a graph-based classification approach for predicting node labels given network structures, either observed or automatically induced. This approach is especially suitable when edges in the networks contain multiple input features. 
The contributions of this thesis work can be seen from several aspects. First, it provides a probabilistic framework that allows us to learn global optimal undirected graph structures with a low polynomial (quadratic when the graph is sparse) computational cost. Second, the development of Feature Vector Machine theoretically enriches current approaches to feature selection and extends our structure learning model so that the non-linear dependencies among node variables can be captured. Third, a graph-based classification approach is developed for predicting node labels using the observed or learned network structures. Fourth, we provided empirical evidence for the proposed methods in gene regulatory network re-construction and gene function prediction, as well as multi-class text categorization tasks.",2007,
A Sparse Multiwavelet-Based Generalized Laguerre-Volterra Model for Identifying Time-Varying Neural Dynamics from Spiking Activities,"Modeling of a time-varying dynamical system provides insights into the functions of biological neural networks and contributes to the development of next-generation neural prostheses. In this paper, we have formulated a novel sparse multiwavelet-based generalized Laguerreâ€“Volterra (sMGLV) modeling framework to identify the time-varying neural dynamics from multiple spike train data. First, the significant inputs are selected by using a group least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method, which can capture the sparsity within the neural system. Second, the multiwavelet-based basis function expansion scheme with an efficient forward orthogonal regression (FOR) algorithm aided by mutual information is utilized to rapidly capture the time-varying characteristics from the sparse model. Quantitative simulation results demonstrate that the proposed sMGLV model in this paper outperforms the initial full model and the state-of-the-art modeling methods in tracking performance for various time-varying kernels. Analyses of experimental data show that the proposed sMGLV model can capture the timing of transient changes accurately. The proposed framework will be useful to the study of how, when, and where information transmission processes across brain regions evolve in behavior.",2017,Entropy
Spectral unmixing using Lasso screening rules,"Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) is a technique for selecting a sparse combination of given features. Spectral unmixing is a Lasso problem, regarding that the spectrum of every pixel is a linear combination of a small number of spectrums from a possibly very large spectral library. In this paper we apply a technique called screening to speedup the Lasso process for spectral unmixing. Our contribution is two-fold: we make use of the theoretical results to practical remote sensing problems; more importantly, we develop a tailored Lasso algorithm coupled with screening, as the unmixing requires that the fractions should be positive and sum to one. We also solve the high mutual coherence problem in the library by ticking out the spectrums with high mutual coherence. We use the AVIRIS data over Cuprite, Nevada (250 lines by 191 columns) to demonstrate the idea. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the screening method.",2014,2014 IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium
Numerical Analysis for Conservation Laws Using $$l_1$$l1 Minimization,"This paper develops and analyzes a new numerical scheme for solving hyperbolic conservation laws that combines the Lax Wendroff method with $$l_1$$l1 regularization. While prior investigations constructed similar algorithms, the method developed here adds a new critical conservation constraint. We demonstrate that the resulting method is equivalent to the well known lasso problem, guaranteeing both existence and uniqueness of the numerical solution. We further prove consistency, convergence, and conservation of our scheme, and also show that it is TVD and satisfies the weak entropy condition for conservation laws. Numerical solutions to Burgersâ€™ and Eulerâ€™s equation validate our analytical results.",2019,Journal of Scientific Computing
Bayesian Subset Modeling for High-Dimensional Generalized Linear Models,"This article presents a new prior setting for high-dimensional generalized linear models, which leads to a Bayesian subset regression (BSR) with the maximum a posteriori model approximately equivalent to the minimum extended Bayesian information criterion model. The consistency of the resulting posterior is established under mild conditions. Further, a variable screening procedure is proposed based on the marginal inclusion probability, which shares the same properties of sure screening and consistency with the existing sure independence screening (SIS) and iterative sure independence screening (ISIS) procedures. However, since the proposed procedure makes use of joint information from all predictors, it generally outperforms SIS and ISIS in real applications. This article also makes extensive comparisons of BSR with the popular penalized likelihood methods, including Lasso, elastic net, SIS, and ISIS. The numerical results indicate that BSR can generally outperform the penalized likelihood methods. The models selected by BSR tend to be sparser and, more importantly, of higher prediction ability. In addition, the performance of the penalized likelihood methods tends to deteriorate as the number of predictors increases, while this is not significant for BSR. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.",2013,Journal of the American Statistical Association
Development of dynamic Bayesian network for the analysis of high-dimensional biomedical data,"Inferring gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from time-course expression data is a major challenge in Bioinformatics. Advances in microarray technology have given rise to cheap and easy production of high-dimensional biological datasets, however, accurate analysis and prediction have been hampered by the curse of dimensionality problem whereby the number of features exponentially larger than the number of samples. Therefore, the need for the development of better statistical and predictive methods is continually on the increase. 
 
The main aim of this thesis is to develop dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) methods for analysis and prediction temporal biomedical data. A two stage computational bionetwork discovery approach is proposed. In the ovarian cancer case study, 39 out of 592 metabolomic features were selected by the Least Angle Shrinkage and Subset Operator (LASSO) with highest accuracy of 93% and 21 chemical compounds identified. 
 
The proposed approach is further improved by the application of swarm optimisation methods for parameter optimization. The improved method was applied to colorectal cancer diagnosis with 1.8% improvement in total accuracy, which was achieved with much less feature subsets of clinical importance than thousands of features when compared to previous studies. 
 
In order to address the modelling inefficiencies in inferring GRNs from time-course data, two nonlinear hybrid algorithms were proposed using support vector regression with DBN, and recurrent neural network with DBN. Experiments showed that the proposed method was better at predicting nonlinearities in GRNs than previous methods. Stratified analysis using Ovarian cancer time-course data further showed that the expression levels Prostrate differentiation factor and BTG family member 2 genes, were significantly increased by the cisplatin and oxaliplatin platinum drugs; while expression levels of Polo-like kinase and Cyclin B1 genes, were both decreased by the platinum drugs. The methods and results obtained may be useful in the designing of drugs and vaccines.",2017,

The generalized LASSO,"In the last few years, the support vector machine (SVM) method has motivated new interest in kernel regression techniques. Although the SVM has been shown to exhibit excellent generalization properties in many experiments, it suffers from several drawbacks, both of a theoretical and a technical nature: the absence of probabilistic outputs, the restriction to Mercer kernels, and the steep growth of the number of support vectors with increasing size of the training set. In this paper, we present a different class of kernel regressors that effectively overcome the above problems. We call this approach generalized LASSO regression. It has a clear probabilistic interpretation, can handle learning sets that are corrupted by outliers, produces extremely sparse solutions, and is capable of dealing with large-scale problems. For regression functionals which can be modeled as iteratively reweighted least-squares (IRLS) problems, we present a highly efficient algorithm with guaranteed global convergence. This defies a unique framework for sparse regression models in the very rich class of IRLS models, including various types of robust regression models and logistic regression. Performance studies for many standard benchmark datasets effectively demonstrate the advantages of this model over related approaches.",2004,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks

Hygiene promotion in Burkina Faso.,"
 Successful hygiene promotion programs in developing countries require identification of local risk practices and messages most likely to have a real impact on disease incidence. This process was applied in a diarrhea prevention program in Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso. Field workers observed and recorded events such as child defecation and met with mothers to develop feasible alternative practices. Key was prevention of feces from getting into the environment, either through better stool control or adequate hand washing after stool contact, preferably with soap. It was determined that the most effective means for stopping fecal material from getting into the child's environment is to ensure that feces are disposed of safely and to ensure that hands that have come into contact with feces are thoroughly washed. Prevention of fecal materials from entering the domestic environment substantially reduces the risk of secondary transmission through uncovered food, unwashed plates. Interventions that make water more accessible facilitate hand washing and other domestic hygiene measures. The need for costly fly control measures can be reduced by steps to abolish breeding sites in animal dung.

The Printed Music Book in Context: Observations on Some Sixteenth-Century Editions,"A visitor to the Augsburg Staatsund Stadtbibliothek who calls for 4Â° Tonkunst Schletterer 411-15 will receive five partbooks bound in parchment, each with the name of a voice part written on the cover in a sixteenth-century hand. On the front of the cantus are the initials ""G.A.,"" while on the title page of the first print in each volume we read the inscription ""Ex libris Gregorij Aichinger,"" an indication that these partbooks were once owned by the Augsburg composer Gregor Aichinger. Bound together in each partbook are the voice parts of twelve madrigal books published between 1555 and 1562-books of five-voice madrigals by Cipriano de Rore, Orlando di Lasso, and Giaches de Wert, as well as Books 1-3 of the Muse series published by Antonio Gardano, and Books 1-2 of I dolci et harmoniosi concenti printed by Girolamo Scotto.' The partbooks are all in small oblong quarto-the most common format for printed music of the first half of the sixteenth century, with a leaf size, in this case, of about 15.3 x 20.6 cm. The simplicity of the binding suggests a utilitarian approach to the books on the part of their owner. If Aichinger, who was born in 1564, was the first to acquire these madrigal books, he must have done so at least two decades after the latest of the group was published. Alternatively, they may have been purchased and bound by an earlier collector, and then have come into Aichinger's hands in their present state. Aichinger would then simply have written his initials and Ex libris in the bound volumes. Whatever the ownership history of these books, they demonstrate an intense interest in the mid-century Italian madrigal on the part of Aichinger, and perhaps on the part of a previous owner as well. Above all, the madrigal books form an interesting backdrop to Aichinger's compositional style,",1990,Notes
Balloon for ablation around pulmonary veins,"PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED: To provide a catheter.SOLUTION: Cardiac ablation is carried out by introducing a catheter into the left atrium, extending a lasso guide through a lumen of the catheter to engage a wall of a pulmonary vein, and deploying a balloon over the lasso guide. The balloon has an electrode assembly disposed on its exterior. The electrode assembly includes a plurality of ablation electrodes circumferentially arranged about the longitudinal axis of the catheter. The inflated balloon is positioned against the pulmonary vein ostium, so that the ablation electrodes are in galvanic contact with the pulmonary vein, and electrical energy is conducted through the ablation electrodes to produce a circumferential lesion that circumscribes the pulmonary vein.SELECTED DRAWING: Figure 1",2015,
"A ""fall-back"" technique for difficult inferior vena cava filter retrieval.","OBJECTIVE
The purpose of this study was to describe the results of an alternative technique for inferior vena cava filter (IVCF) retrieval that can be used when the retrieval hook cannot be snared.


METHODS
Retrospective review of all patients undergoing attempted IVCF retrieval by a single surgeon between March 2009 and March 2011 was undertaken. After December 2009, in cases where the retrieval hook could not be snared, an 18F/85 cm sheath was inserted into the internal jugular vein and a Bentson wire (Cook Medical, Bloomington, Ind) and snare were advanced across separate interstices of the filter. The resulting ""lasso"" was pulled up below the collar at the top of the filter, and the filter collapsed into the sheath.


RESULTS
Over 28 months, 34 patients underwent attempted retrieval of GÃ¼nther Tulip filters (Cook Medical). Patients were 44Â±15 years old; 59% were women (n=20). Filters were placed for venous thromboembolism with contraindication to anticoagulation in seven cases and prophylactically in 27 cases. Of the prophylactic cases, 18 (67%) were placed before planned bariatric surgery. Before December 2009, the success rate was 86% (6 of 7): the retrieval hook of one filter could not be snared and seemed to be embedded in the wall of the cava. After adoption of the described technique, the success rate was 96% (26 of 27): one patient refused further attempts at central venous catheterization after multiple unsuccessful attempts. Filters retrieved conventionally by snaring the hook (n=18) were implanted on average for 4.8Â±3.7 months and 12.1Â±10.1 months for those retrieved using the new technique (n=14; P=.02). All patients were discharged on the day of the procedure without complication. The one patient in whom the retrieval hook could not be snared before December 2009 has refused another attempt at retrieval.


CONCLUSIONS
The method of IVCF retrieval described here was successful in every instance in which it was attempted. It was associated with no morbidity despite the customary use of an 18F sheath in the internal jugular vein. The approach constitutes an appropriate ""fall-back"" technique when the retrieval hook of a removable IVCF cannot be snared.",2012,Journal of vascular surgery
Geodetic inversion for spatial distribution of slow earthquakes under sparsity constraint (Fused Lasso),"In geodetic data inversion, insufficient observational data and smoothness constraints for model parameters make it difficult to clearly resolve small-scale heterogeneous structures with discontinuous boundaries. Therefore, we have developed a novel regularization scheme for the inversion problem that uses smoothness, discontinuity, and sparsity constraints [Nakata et al., 2016]. We have applied the inversion method to synthetic displacements due to the simulated afterslip on the plate interface. The method accurately reproduces the slip distribution. However, the proposed method have some problems in terms of calculation cost and applicability. Then, we are now improving the method to treat more realistic and larger scale problem than our previous study. We are investigating other mathematical algorithms as the sparsity constraint, such as Fused Lasso, Adaptive Lasso, and Relaxed Lasso for evaluation function. And we prepare analyzing realistic displacement data observed at GEONET stations around the Bungo channel on 1997, 2003, and 2010. By using an improving method, we will show inversion results using sparsity constraint for the three slow slip events occurred beneath the Bungo channel.

Construction and Validation of an Immune-Related Prognostic Model Based on TP53 Status in Colorectal Cancer,"Growing evidence has indicated that prognostic biomarkers have a pivotal role in tumor and immunity biological processes. TP53 mutation can cause a range of changes in immune response, progression, and prognosis of colorectal cancer (CRC). Thus, we aim to build an immunoscore prognostic model that may enhance the prognosis of CRC from an immunological perspective. We estimated the proportion of immune cells in the GSE39582 public dataset using the CIBERSORT (Cell type identification by estimating relative subset of known RNA transcripts) algorithm. Prognostic genes that were used to establish the immunoscore model were generated by the LASSO (Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) Cox regression model. We established and validated the immunoscore model in GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) and TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) cohorts, respectively; significant differences of overall survival analysis were found between the low and high immunoscore groups or TP53 subgroups. In the multivariable Cox analysis, we observed that the immunoscore was an independent prognostic factor both in the GEO cohort (HR (Hazard ratio) 1.76, 95% CI (confidence intervals): 1.26-2.46) and the TCGA cohort (HR 1.95, 95% CI: 1.20-3.18). Furthermore, we established a nomogram for clinical application, and the results suggest that the nomogram is a better predictive model for prognosis than immunoscore or TNM staging.",2019,Cancers
L2-Boosting algorithm applied to high-dimensional problems in genomic selection.,"The L(2)-Boosting algorithm is one of the most promising machine-learning techniques that has appeared in recent decades. It may be applied to high-dimensional problems such as whole-genome studies, and it is relatively simple from a computational point of view. In this study, we used this algorithm in a genomic selection context to make predictions of yet to be observed outcomes. Two data sets were used: (1) productive lifetime predicted transmitting abilities from 4702 Holstein sires genotyped for 32 611 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) derived from the Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip, and (2) progeny averages of food conversion rate, pre-corrected by environmental and mate effects, in 394 broilers genotyped for 3481 SNPs. Each of these data sets was split into training and testing sets, the latter comprising dairy or broiler sires whose ancestors were in the training set. Two weak learners, ordinary least squares (OLS) and non-parametric (NP) regression were used for the L2-Boosting algorithm, to provide a stringent evaluation of the procedure. This algorithm was compared with BL [Bayesian LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator)] and BayesA regression. Learning tasks were carried out in the training set, whereas validation of the models was performed in the testing set. Pearson correlations between predicted and observed responses in the dairy cattle (broiler) data set were 0.65 (0.33), 0.53 (0.37), 0.66 (0.26) and 0.63 (0.27) for OLS-Boosting, NP-Boosting, BL and BayesA, respectively. The smallest bias and mean-squared errors (MSEs) were obtained with OLS-Boosting in both the dairy cattle (0.08 and 1.08, respectively) and broiler (-0.011 and 0.006) data sets, respectively. In the dairy cattle data set, the BL was more accurate (bias=0.10 and MSE=1.10) than BayesA (bias=1.26 and MSE=2.81), whereas no differences between these two methods were found in the broiler data set. L2-Boosting with a suitable learner was found to be a competitive alternative for genomic selection applications, providing high accuracy and low bias in genomic-assisted evaluations with a relatively short computational time.",2010,Genetics research
Multi-label Subspace Ensemble,"A challenging problem of multi-label learning is that both the label space and the model complexity will grow rapidly with the increase in the number of labels, and thus makes the available training samples insufficient for training a proper model. In this paper, we eliminate this problem by learning a mapping of each label in the feature space as a robust subspace, and formulating the prediction as finding the group sparse representation of a given instance on the subspace ensemble. We term this approach as â€œmulti-label subspace ensemble (MSE)â€. In the training stage, the data matrix is decomposed as the sum of several low-rank matrices and a sparse residual via a randomized optimization, where each low-rank part defines a subspace mapped by a label. In the prediction stage, the group sparse representation on the subspace ensemble is estimated by group lasso. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the appealing performance of MSE.",2012,
Extracellular microRNAs in blood differentiate between ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke subtypes,"Rapid identification of patients suffering from cerebral ischaemia, while excluding intracerebral haemorrhage, can assist with patient triage and expand patient access to chemical and mechanical revascularization. We sought to identify blood-based, extracellular microRNAs 15 (ex-miRNAs) derived from extracellular vesicles associated with major stroke subtypes using clinical samples from subjects with spontaneous intraparenchymal haemorrhage (IPH), aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) and ischaemic stroke due to cerebral vessel occlusion. We collected blood from patients presenting with IPH (n = 19), SAH (n = 17) and ischaemic stroke (n = 21). We isolated extracellular vesicles from plasma, extracted RNA cargo, 20 sequenced the small RNAs and performed bioinformatic analyses to identify ex-miRNA biomarkers predictive of the stroke subtypes. Sixty-seven miRNAs were significantly variant across the stroke subtypes. A subset of exmiRNAs differed between haemorrhagic and ischaemic strokes, and LASSO analysis could distinguish SAH from the other subtypes with an accuracy of 0.972 Â± 0.002. Further analyses predicted 25 miRNA classifiers that stratify IPH from ischaemic stroke with an accuracy of 0.811 Â± 0.004 and distinguish haemorrhagic from ischaemic stroke with an accuracy of 0.813 Â± 0.003. Blood-based, ex-miRNAs have predictive value, and could be capable of distinguishing between major stroke subtypes with refinement and validation. Such a biomarker could one day aid in the triage of patients to expand the pool eligible for effective treatment.",2020,Journal of Extracellular Vesicles
The Bene t of Group Sparsity,"This paper develops a theory for group Lasso using a concept called strong group sparsity. Our result shows that group Lasso is superior to standard Lasso for strongly group-sparse signals. This provides a convincing theoretical justi cation for using group sparse regularization when the underlying group structure is consistent with the data. Moreover, the theory predicts some limitations of the group Lasso formulation that are con rmed by simulation studies.",2018,
Safety and efficacy of re-treatments with pyronaridine-artesunate in African patients with malaria: a substudy of the WANECAM randomised trial,"BACKGROUND
Sparse data on the safety of pyronaridine-artesunate after repeated treatment of malaria episodes restrict its clinical use. We therefore compared the safety of pyronaridine-artesunate after treatment of the first episode of malaria versus re-treatment in a substudy analysis.


METHODS
This planned substudy analysis of the randomised, open-label West African Network for Clinical Trials of Antimalarial Drugs (WANECAM) phase 3b/4 trial was done at six health facilities in Mali, Burkina Faso, and Guinea in patients (aged â‰¥6 months and bodyweight â‰¥5 kg) with uncomplicated microscopically confirmed Plasmodium spp malaria (parasite density <200 000 per Î¼L blood) and fever or history of fever. The primary safety endpoint was incidence of hepatotoxicity: alanine aminotransferase of greater than five times the upper limit of normal (ULN) or Hy's criteria (alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase greater than three times the ULN and total bilirubin more than twice the ULN) after treatment of the first episode of malaria and re-treatment (â‰¥28 days after first treatment) with pyronaridine-artesunate. Pyronaridine-artesunate efficacy was compared with artemether-lumefantrine with the adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) in an intention-to-treat analysis. WANECAM is registered with PACTR.org, number PACTR201105000286876.


FINDINGS
Following first treatment, 13 (1%) of 996 patients had hepatotoxicity (including one [<1%] possible Hy's law case) versus two (1%) of 311 patients on re-treatment (neither a Hy's law case). No evidence was found that pyronaridine-artesunate re-treatment increased safety risk based on laboratory values, reported adverse event frequencies, or electrocardiograph findings. For all first treatment or re-treatment episodes, pyronaridine-artesunate (n=673) day 28 crude ACPR was 92Â·7% (95% CI 91Â·0-94Â·3) versus 80Â·4% (77Â·8-83Â·0) for artemether-lumefantrine (n=671). After exclusion of patients with PCR-confirmed new infections, ACPR was similar on treatment and re-treatment and greater than 95% at day 28 and greater than 91% at day 42 in both treatment groups.


INTERPRETATION
The findings that pyronaridine-artesunate safety and efficacy were similar on first malaria treatment versus re-treatment of subsequent episodes lend support for the wider access to pyronaridine-artesunate as an alternative artemisinin-based combination treatment for malaria in sub-Saharan Africa.

A Markovian approach to distributional semantics,"This thesis, which is organized in two independent parts, presents work on distributional semantics and on variable selection. In the first part, we introduce a new method for learning good word representations using large quantities of unlabeled sentences. The method is based on a probabilistic model of sentence, using a hidden Markov model and a syntactic dependency tree. The latent variables, which correspond to the nodes of the dependency tree, aim at capturing the meanings of the words. We develop an efficient algorithm to perform inference and learning in those models, based on online EM and approximate message passing. We then evaluate our models on intrinsic tasks such as predicting human similarity judgements or word categorization, and on two extrinsic tasks: named entity recognition and supersense tagging. In the second part, we introduce, in the context of linear models, a new penalty function to perform variable selection in the case of highly correlated predictors. This penalty, called the trace Lasso, uses the trace norm of the selected predictors, which is a convex surrogate of their rank, as the criterion of model complexity. The trace Lasso interpolates between the $\ell_1$-norm and $\ell_2$-norm. In particular, it is equal to the $\ell_1$-norm if all predictors are orthogonal and to the $\ell_2$-norm if all predictors are equal. We propose two algorithms to compute the solution of least-squares regression regularized by the trace Lasso, and perform experiments on synthetic datasets to illustrate the behavior of the trace Lasso.",2014,
Appearance-based localization using Group LASSO regression with an indoor experiment,"This paper proposes appearance-based localization using online vision images collected from an omnidirectional camera attached on a mobile robot or a vehicle. Our approach builds on a combination of the group Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and the extended Kalman filter (EKF). Fast Fourier transform (FFT) and Histogram are extracted from omni-directional images, the features of which are selected via the group LASSO regression. The EKF takes the output of the group LASSO regression based first-stage localization as the observation. The indoor experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",2015,2015 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics (AIM)
Regularized Estimation of Large Scale Gene Regulatory Networks,"When dealing with graphical Gaussian models for gene regulatory networks, the major problem is to compute the matrix of partial correlations. Based on the close connection between partial correlations and least squares regression, we suggest estimation of high-dimensional gene networks in terms of partial least squares (PLS) regression and the adaptive Lasso, respectively. In a simulation study, we compare the performance of the proposed methods in terms of their ability to estimate partial correlations and to derive the underlying network structure.",2007,
"Prediction of fatty acid profiles in cow, ewe, and goat milk by mid-infrared spectrometry.","Mid-infrared (MIR) spectrometry was used to estimate the fatty acid (FA) composition in cow, ewe, and goat milk. The objectives were to compare different statistical approaches with wavelength selection to predict the milk FA composition from MIR spectra, and to develop equations for FA in cow, goat, and ewe milk. In total, a set of 349 cow milk samples, 200 ewe milk samples, and 332 goat milk samples were both analyzed by MIR and by gas chromatography, the reference method. A broad FA variability was ensured by using milk from different breeds and feeding systems. The methods studied were partial least squares regression (PLS), first-derivative pretreatment + PLS, genetic algorithm + PLS, wavelets + PLS, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method (LASSO), and elastic net. The best results were obtained with PLS, genetic algorithm + PLS and first derivative + PLS. The residual standard deviation and the coefficient of determination in external validation were used to characterize the equations and to retain the best for each FA in each species. In all cases, the predictions were of better quality for FA found at medium to high concentrations (i.e., for saturated FA and some monounsaturated FA with a coefficient of determination in external validation >0.90). The conversion of the FA expressed in grams per 100mL of milk to grams per 100g of FA was possible with a small loss of accuracy for some FA.",2014,Journal of dairy science
The Quiet Rehabilitation of the Brick Factory: Early Soviet Popular Music and its Critics,"A recent collection of Soviet song texts differs from its many predecessors in one interesting respect.' It contains Pavel German's ""Pesnia o kirpichnom zavode,"" better known as ""Kirpichiki,"" one of the most popular songs of the late 1920s, and a song that for decades symbolized the survival of petit-bourgeois tastes and poshlost' after the Revolution. This quiet rehabilitation can serve as the occasion to examine an aspect of Soviet cultural history that is rarely discussed outside the USSR, namely, the beginnings of Soviet popular music. Even so thorough a work as Boris Schwarz's study of Soviet music devotes a total of no more than five pages (out of nearly five hundred pages of text) to ""mass songs"" and jazz.2 But Schwarz does provide an account of the ideological struggles in 1921-32, which culminated in what he calls, borrowing Edward J. Brown's term, the ""proletarian phase"" in Soviet arts.3 Paralleling the efforts of the better-known Russian Association of Proletarian Writers (RAPP, 1925-32) and the short-lived Russian Association of Proletarian Artists (RAPKh, 1931-32), the Russian Association of Proletarian Musicians (RAPM, 1923-32, at various times also known as APM or VAPM) led the campaign ""for proletarian music"" (the title of one of its journals was Za proletarskuiu muzyku, 1930-32) and against various composers of both ""light"" and ""serious"" music, domestic and foreign. A less than sympathetic veteran of the period, writing in the late 1960s, put it differently: ""All works written by nonmembers of VAPM were anathematized and declared harmful from a class point of view [klassovo vrednymi] .""4 RAPM was dissolved in 1932, together with other proletarian organizations in literature and the arts, by a resolution of the Central Committee of the",1980,Slavic Review
A machine learning pipeline for internal anatomical landmark embedding based on a patient surface model,"PurposeWith the recent introduction of fully assisting scanner technologies by Siemens Healthineers (Erlangen, Germany), a patient surface model was introduced to the diagnostic imaging device market. Such a patient representation can be used to automate and accelerate the clinical imaging workflow, manage patient dose, and provide navigation assistance for computed tomography diagnostic imaging. In addition to diagnostic imaging, a patient surface model has also tremendous potential to simplify interventional imaging. For example, if the anatomy of a patient was known, a robotic angiography system could be automatically positioned such that the organ of interest is positioned in the systemâ€™s iso-center offering a good and flexible view on the underlying patient anatomy quickly and without any additional X-ray dose.MethodTo enable such functionality in a clinical context with sufficiently high accuracy, we present an extension of our previous patient surface model by adding internal anatomical landmarks associated with certain (main) bones of the human skeleton, in particular the spine. We also investigate different approaches to positioning of these landmarks employing CT datasets with annotated internal landmarks as training data. The general pipeline of our proposed method comprises the following steps: First, we train an active shape model using an existing avatar database and segmented CT surfaces. This stage also includes a gravity correction procedure, which accounts for shape changes due to the fact that the avatar models were obtained in standing position, while the CT data were acquired with patients in supine position. Second, we match the gravity-corrected avatar patient surface models to surfaces segmented from the CT datasets. In the last step, we derive the spatial relationships between the patient surface model and internal anatomical landmarks.ResultWe trained and evaluated our method using cross-validation using 20 datasets, each containing 50 internal landmarks. We further compared the performance of four different generalized linear modelsâ€™ setups to describe the positioning of the internal landmarks relative to the patient surface. The best mean estimation error over all the landmarks was achieved using lasso regression with a mean error of $$12.19 \pm 6.98\ \hbox {mm}$$12.19Â±6.98mm.ConclusionConsidering that interventional X-ray imaging systems can have detectors covering an area of about $$200\ \hbox {mm} \times 266\ \hbox {mm}$$200mmÃ—266mm ($$20\ \hbox {cm} \times 27\ \hbox {cm}$$20cmÃ—27cm) at iso-center, this accuracy is sufficient to facilitate automatic positioning of the X-ray system.",2018,International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery

Learning extremely shared middle-level image representation for scene classification,"Learning middle-level image representations is very important for the computer vision community, especially for scene classification tasks. Middle-level image representations currently available are not sparse enough to make training and testing times compatible with the increasing number of classes that users want to recognize. In this work, we propose a middle-level image representation based on the pattern that extremely shared among different classes to reduce both training and test time. The proposed learning algorithm first finds some class-specified patterns and then utilizes the lasso regularization to select the most discriminative patterns shared among different classes. The experimental results on some widely used scene classification benchmarks (15 Scenes, MIT-indoor 67, SUN 397) show that the fewest patterns are necessary to achieve very remarkable performance with reduced computation time.",2016,Knowledge and Information Systems
Glucose Tolerance Reactions in Eczema: a Report of Eighty-six Consecutive Cases,"The first scientific work of any extent dealing with the carbohydrate metabolism in eczema and eczematoid eruptions was that reported recently by McGlasson.1McGlasson dealt only with the fasting blood sugar determinations.

Identifying the time scale of temporal association,"Previously used methods of investigating the temporal association of behavioural events have tested sequences of events for temporal clumping; such an approach does not quantitatively indicate the time scale over which the association is significant. We present a novel method of analysis that specifically identifies this time scale, thereby allowing more ready elimination of competing causal hypotheses for the association observed. Our null hypothesis is that, following any event, the number of events in a given time interval is independent of the time elapsed since the initial event. The method is simple and robust against long-term changes in event frequency, and provides a more detailed quantitative description of the temporal association. We illustrate it using data on spawning in the blueheaded wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum). The analysis demonstrates that, after a spawning event, there is a 70% increase in mean spawning frequency which lasts for 30â€‚s and then abruptly disappears.

Con el objeto de estudiar la composicion cualitativa y cuantitativa de su dieta en una laguna marinocostera de la peninsula de Araya, fueron analizados, por frecuencia de ocurrencia (FO), 40 contenidos estomacales in situ . El espectro trofico estuvo integrado por peces (FO = 62,5 %), crustaceos (FO = 25%) y gasteropodos (FO = 12,5%). P. olivaceus consumio mayoritariamente peces de las familias Ariidae ( Cathorops spixii, Arius sp.), Dactylopteridae ( Dactylopterus volitans ), Engraulidae, ( Cetengraulis edentulus ), Batrachoididae ( Thalassophryne maculosa ) y Mugilidae ( Mugil liza ), en ese orden; siguiendo en importancia, crustaceos ( e.g., Carpillus sp., Balanus sp.) y gasteropodos ( Astraea sp., Fasciola tulipa ). Los peces presentaron un promedio de 2,9 Â± 1,34 individuos por estomago, con una longitud corporal promedio de 15,5 Â± 3,51 cm, mientras el peso del contenido estomacal promedio 93,37 Â± 42,52 g. Independientemente de la disponibilidad estacional de algunas presas y/o los habitat explotados, en algunas especies de cotuas la presencia mayoritaria de un determinado renglon alimentario podria ser el resultado no tanto de la abundancia estacional del mismo sino de su tamano, como se ha sugerido para P. carbo y P. auritus . Mas que ser capturados directamente por el ave, la presencia de invertebrados en el espectro dietetico de P. olivaceus podria deberse a que son presas habituales de los peces consumidos. Estos hallazgos parecen indicar que P. olivaceus es un versatil depredador piscivoro, el cual prefiere consumir especies de peces bentonicos con poca capacidad de desplazamiento. PALABRAS CLAVE : Phalacrocorax olivaceus , diet, marine coastal lagoon. ABSTRACT The olivaceous cormorant ( Phalacrocorax olivaceus ) is distributed throughout venezuelan coasts and major rivers. In the interest of studying their diet qualitatively and quantitatively, 40 stomach contents from those birds were analyzed in situ using occurrence frequency (OF) in a marine coastal lagoon located in Peninsula de Araya, Venezuela. Trophic composition consisted of fishes (OF: 62,5%), crustaceans (OF: 25%) and gastropods (OF: 12,5%). The Olivaceous Cormorant feeds mainly on fishes belonging to families Ariidae ( Cathorops spixii, Arius sp.), Dactylopteridae ( Dactylopterus volitans ), Engraulidae ( Cetengraulis edentulus ), Batrachoididae ( Thalassopryne maculosa ), and Mugilidae ( Mugil liza ), in that order, following in importance crustaceans ( Carpillus sp., Balanus sp.) and gastropods ( Astraea sp., Fasciola tulipa ). Birds averaged 2,9 Â± 1,34 fi shes per stomach and 15,5 cm Â± 3,51 of body size, while the stomach content weight averaged 93,37 g Â± 45,52. Notwithstanding seasonal prey availability and/or the exploited habitats, prevalence of some prey items in olivaceous cormorant might be the result of their size instead of their seasonal abundance, as suggested for P. carbo and P. auritus cormorant species.

Adaptive Class Preserving Representation for Image Classification,"In linear representation-based image classification, an unlabeled sample is represented by the entire training set. To obtain a stable and discriminative solution, regularization on the vector of representation coefficients is necessary. For example, the representation in sparse representation-based classification (SRC) uses L1 norm penalty as regularization, which is equal to lasso. However, lasso overemphasizes the role of sparseness while ignoring the inherent structure among samples belonging to a same class. Many recent developed representation classifications have adopted lasso-type regressions to improve the performance. In this paper, we propose the adaptive class preserving representation for classification (ACPRC). Our method is related to group lasso based classification but different in two key points: When training samples in a class are uncorrelated, ACPRC turns into SRC, when samples in a class are highly correlated, it obtains similar result as group lasso. The superiority of ACPRC over other state-of-the-art regularization techniques including lasso, group lasso, sparse group lasso, etc. are evaluated by extensive experiments.",2017,2017 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)
Identifying correlations between LIGO's astronomical range and auxiliary sensors using lasso regression,"The range to which the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) can observe astrophysical systems varies over time, limited by noise in the instruments and their environments. Identifying and removing the sources of noise that limit LIGO's range enables higher signal-to-noise observations and increases the number of observations. The LIGO observatories are continuously monitored by hundreds of thousands of auxiliary channels that may contain information about these noise sources. This paper describes an algorithm that uses linear regression, namely lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) regression, to analyze all of these channels and identify a small subset of them that can be used to reconstruct variations in LIGO's astrophysical range. Exemplary results of the application of this method to three different periods of LIGO Livingston data are presented, along with computational performance and current limitations.",2018,Classical and Quantum Gravity
Evaluation of Finger Tendon Transfer Surgery Using the Two-Dimensional Link Model Simulating Paralysis of Intrinsic Muscle,"A finger component was modeled by four tendons of three extrinsic muscles and an intrinsic muscle attached on a two-dimensional three rigid links of finger skeleton. Moment arms of each tendon were assumed constant regardless of joint angles. Each muscle generates not only active force but also passive force as a function of changing of muscle length. By judging the capability of moment balance under given finger posture within the limits of each muscle force, the range of motion and the maximum fingertip force were estimated. These results of the paralytic finger were agreed well with the clinical experience. Postoperative effects for two common tendon transfers (Lasso procedure and Four-Tail procedure) were simulated. For Four-Tail procedure, one of the following muscles was selected as a motor, palmaris longs, extensor carpi radialis longus, extensor carpi radialis bervis, and flexor digitorum superficialis of ring finger. The functional defects caused by transferring these wrist muscles were evaluated with the decreasing of total maximum moments of the wrist joint. Calculated results suggested that Four-Tail procedure with extensor carpi radialis longus was superior to other procedures in restoration of both range of motion and fingertip force. It was also found that Lasso procedure corrects fingertip force well.",2006,Transactions of the Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers. C
Channel Pruning for Accelerating Very Deep Neural Networks,"In this paper, we introduce a new channel pruning method to accelerate very deep convolutional neural networks. Given a trained CNN model, we propose an iterative two-step algorithm to effectively prune each layer, by a LASSO regression based channel selection and least square reconstruction. We further generalize this algorithm to multi-layer and multi-branch cases. Our method reduces the accumulated error and enhance the compatibility with various architectures. Our pruned VGG-16 achieves the state-of-the-art results by 5Ã— speed-up along with only 0.3% increase of error. More importantly, our method is able to accelerate modern networks like ResNet, Xception and suffers only 1.4%, 1.0% accuracy loss under 2Ã— speedup respectively, which is significant.",2017,2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)

High Nasal Carriage Rate of Staphylococcus aureus Containing Panton-Valentine leukocidin- and EDIN-Encoding Genes in Community and Hospital Settings in Burkina Faso,"The objectives of the present study were to investigate the rate of S.aureus nasal carriage and molecular characteristics in hospital and community settings in Bobo Dioulasso, Burkina Faso. Nasal samples (n = 219) were collected from 116 healthy volunteers and 103 hospitalized patients in July and August 2014. Samples were first screened using CHROMagar Staph aureus chromogenic agar plates, and S. aureus strains were identified by mass spectrometry. Antibiotic susceptibility was tested using the disk diffusion method on MÃ¼ller-Hinton agar. All S. aureus isolates were genotyped using DNA microarray. Overall, the rate of S. aureus nasal carriage was 32.9% (72/219) with 29% in healthy volunteers and 37% in hospital patients. Among the S. aureus isolates, only four methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains were identified and all in hospital patients (3.9%). The 72 S. aureus isolates from nasal samples belonged to 16 different clonal complexes, particularly to CC 152-MSSA (22 clones) and CC1-MSSA (nine clones). Two clones were significantly associated with community settings: CC1-MSSA and CC45-MSSA. The MRSA strains belonged to the ST88-MRSA-IV or the CC8-MRSA-V complex. A very high prevalence of toxinogenic strains 52.2% (36/69), containing Panton-Valentine leucocidin- and EDIN-encoding genes, was identified among the S. aureus isolates in community and hospital settings. This study provides the first characterization of S. aureus clones and their genetic characteristics in Burkina Faso. Altogether, it highlights the low prevalence of antimicrobial resistance, high diversity of methicillin-sensitive S. aureus clones and high frequency of toxinogenic S. aureus strains.",2016,Frontiers in Microbiology

Lassomycin and lariatin lasso peptides as suitable antibiotics for combating mycobacterial infections: current state of biosynthesis and perspectives for production,"Lasso peptides are ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified natural products with a characteristic slipknot-like structure, which confers these peptides remarkable stability and diverse pharmacologically relevant bioactivities. Among all the reported lasso peptides, lassomycin and lariatins are unique lasso peptides that exhibit noticeable anti-tuberculosis (TB) activity. Due to the unique threaded structure and the unusual bactericidal mechanism toward Mycobacterium tuberculosis, these peptides have drawn considerable interest, not only in the field of total synthesis but also in several other fields including biosynthesis, bioengineering, and structure-activity studies. During the past few years, significant progress has been made in understanding the biosynthetic mechanism of these intriguing compounds, which has provided a solid foundation for future work. This review highlights recent achievements in the discovery, structure elucidation, biological activity, and the unique anti-TB mechanism of lasso peptides.

Submerged macrophyte biomass distribution in the shallow saline lake Fuente de Piedra (Spain) as function of environmental variables,"Aquatic macrophyte biomass, diaspore bank distribution and their relationship to spatial variability of depth, nutrients (nitrite, nitrate, ammonium and soluble reactive phosphorus) as well as sediment granulometry in an athalassohaline lake have been studied during one wet hydrological year. The results indicate that species growing in the lake show different spatial distribution patterns throughout the lake. Indirect gradient analysis (canonical analysis) results showed a first axis defined as a function of Ulva flexuosa Wulfen biomass which is, in turn, positively correlated with interstitial ammonium and Soluble Reactive Phosphorus (SRP). The second axis was mainly established due to Lamprothamnium papulosum (Wallr.) J. Groves biomass which correlated positively to depth and negatively to interstitial ammonium and SRP. These results revealed a NESW eutrophic gradient allowing the U. Flexuosa biomass proliferation. This phenomenon could increase the shadow effect over the rest of the macrophytes inhabiting this shallow lake. Moreover, the eutrophic harmful effect on the macrophyte physiology and over the diaspore bank could have important consequences in the survival of such important populations.

Computationally efficient change point detection for high-dimensional regression,"Large-scale sequential data is often exposed to some degree of inhomogeneity in the form of sudden changes in the parameters of the data-generating process. We consider the problem of detecting such structural changes in a high-dimensional regression setting. We propose a joint estimator of the number and the locations of the change points and of the parameters in the corresponding segments. The estimator can be computed using dynamic programming or, as we emphasize here, it can be approximated using a binary search algorithm with $O(n \log(n) \mathrm{Lasso}(n))$ computational operations while still enjoying essentially the same theoretical properties; here $\mathrm{Lasso}(n)$ denotes the computational cost of computing the Lasso for sample size $n$. We establish oracle inequalities for the estimator as well as for its binary search approximation, covering also the case with a large (asymptotically growing) number of change points. We evaluate the performance of the proposed estimation algorithms on simulated data and apply the methodology to real data.",2016,arXiv: Methodology

National Veterans Health Administration inpatient risk stratification models for hospital-acquired acute kidney injury,"OBJECTIVE
Hospital-acquired acute kidney injury (HA-AKI) is a potentially preventable cause of morbidity and mortality. Identifying high-risk patients prior to the onset of kidney injury is a key step towards AKI prevention.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
A national retrospective cohort of 1,620,898 patient hospitalizations from 116 Veterans Affairs hospitals was assembled from electronic health record (EHR) data collected from 2003 to 2012. HA-AKI was defined at stage 1+, stage 2+, and dialysis. EHR-based predictors were identified through logistic regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) regression, and random forests, and pair-wise comparisons between each were made. Calibration and discrimination metrics were calculated using 50 bootstrap iterations. In the final models, we report odds ratios, 95% confidence intervals, and importance rankings for predictor variables to evaluate their significance.


RESULTS
The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the different model outcomes ranged from 0.746 to 0.758 in stage 1+, 0.714 to 0.720 in stage 2+, and 0.823 to 0.825 in dialysis. Logistic regression had the best AUC in stage 1+ and dialysis. Random forests had the best AUC in stage 2+ but the least favorable calibration plots. Multiple risk factors were significant in our models, including some nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, blood pressure medications, antibiotics, and intravenous fluids given during the first 48â€‰h of admission.


CONCLUSIONS
This study demonstrated that, although all the models tested had good discrimination, performance characteristics varied between methods, and the random forests models did not calibrate as well as the lasso or logistic regression models. In addition, novel modifiable risk factors were explored and found to be significant.",2015,Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA

Hypersaline environments can be classified as: Thalassohaline (originate by solar evaporation of seawater which contains sodium, magnesium, potassium, chloride and sulphate as the major components), and Athalassohaline (originate by solar evaporation of inland surface water) (Ventosa, 2006). The haloarchaea belonging to the family Halobacteriaceae are distinguished by their requirement for high concentration of salts (at least 1.5M NaCl), neutral or high pH, and insensitivity to antibiotics affecting cell-wall (peptidoglycan) synthesis, presence of diphytanyl glycerol ether core-lipids, red C50 carotenoids (bacterioruberins), etc. (Upasani International Journal of Current Microbiology and Applied Sciences ISSN: 2319-7706 Volume 5 Number 11 (2016) pp. 51-64 Journal homepage: http://www.ijcmas.com",2016,International Journal of Current Microbiology and Applied Sciences
FERAL: network-based classifier with application to breast cancer outcome prediction,"MOTIVATION
Breast cancer outcome prediction based on gene expression profiles is an important strategy for personalize patient care. To improve performance and consistency of discovered markers of the initial molecular classifiers, network-based outcome prediction methods (NOPs) have been proposed. In spite of the initial claims, recent studies revealed that neither performance nor consistency can be improved using these methods. NOPs typically rely on the construction of meta-genes by averaging the expression of several genes connected in a network that encodes protein interactions or pathway information. In this article, we expose several fundamental issues in NOPs that impede on the prediction power, consistency of discovered markers and obscures biological interpretation.


RESULTS
To overcome these issues, we propose FERAL, a network-based classifier that hinges upon the Sparse Group Lasso which performs simultaneous selection of marker genes and training of the prediction model. An important feature of FERAL, and a significant departure from existing NOPs, is that it uses multiple operators to summarize genes into meta-genes. This gives the classifier the opportunity to select the most relevant meta-gene for each gene set. Extensive evaluation revealed that the discovered markers are markedly more stable across independent datasets. Moreover, interpretation of the marker genes detected by FERAL reveals valuable mechanistic insight into the etiology of breast cancer.

Niche of 17 Kinds of Plants in Marshes in Honghe,"The niche breadth and niche overlap of 17 kinds of plants in the marshes in Honghe National Nature Reserve were studied. The results showed that there was a broader niche breadth in Carex lasiocarpa, Glyceria spiculosa, Carex pseudocuraica and Calamagrostis angustifolia than other species, because the advantage of widely distribution, quantity, strong competition for the resource utilization contribute to making them dominant species in the research region. Other species such as Menyanthes trifoliate, Salix myrtilloides, Ranunculus monophyllus and Geranium vlassowianum had a narrow niche width; the capacity of resource utilization was weak. Pianka index was used to calculate the niche overlaps of 17 species, which it revealed that 17 species were not of completely overlap. The niche overlap index of 107 species counterparts were lower than 0.2, accounting for 78.7%, and among them 43 species counterparts overlap index was zero, accounting for 31.6%.That indicated that the similarities of resource utilization were low; The relationship between niche overlap of the species and niche breadth was relatively complex.",2015,Wetland Science
1 2 O ct 2 01 9 First order expansion of convex regularized estimators,"We consider first order expansions of convex penalized estimators in highdimensional regression problems with random designs. Our setting includes linear regression and logistic regression as special cases. For a given penalty function h and the corresponding penalized estimator Î²Ì‚, we construct a quantity Î·, the first order expansion of Î²Ì‚, such that the distance between Î²Ì‚ and Î· is an order of magnitude smaller than the estimation error â€–Î²Ì‚ âˆ’ Î²âˆ—â€–. In this sense, the first order expansion Î· can be thought of as a generalization of influence functions from the mathematical statistics literature to regularized estimators in high-dimensions. Such first order expansion implies that the risk of Î²Ì‚ is asymptotically the same as the risk of Î· which leads to a precise characterization of the MSE of Î²Ì‚; this characterization takes a particularly simple form for isotropic design. Such first order expansion also leads to inference results based on Î²Ì‚. We provide sufficient conditions for the existence of such first order expansion for three regularizers: the Lasso in its constrained form, the lasso in its penalized form, and the Group-Lasso. The results apply to general loss functions under some conditions and those conditions are satisfied for the squared loss in linear regression and for the logistic loss in the logistic model. Introduction. We consider learning problems where one observes observations (X1, Y1), ..., (Xn, Yn) with responses Yi and feature vectors Xi âˆˆ R. The literature of the past two decades has demonstrated the great success of regularized estimators that are commonly defined as solutions to regularized optimization problems of the form Î²Ì‚ = argminÎ²âˆˆRp n âˆ’1 âˆ‘n i=1 l(Yi, X T i Î²) + h(Î²), (1) where l(Â·, Â·) is referred to as the loss (e.g. squared loss, logistic loss) and h : R â†’ R is a regularization penalty (e.g. the l1-norm for the Lasso, the l2,1 norm for the Group-Lasso). All tuning parameters are included in h(Â·). The performance of such regularized estimators is measured in terms of prediction error or in terms estimation error â€–Î²Ì‚ âˆ’ Î²âˆ—â€– if the data comes from a model such as Y = XÎ² + Îµ for some noise random variable Îµ in linear regression or P(Y = 1|X = x) = 1/(1 + exp(xÎ²)) = 1âˆ’ P(Y = 0|X = x) in logistic regression, where Î² is the unknown coefficient vector. For instance, if s = â€–Î²â€–0 is the sparsity of Î² in the above model, and (Xi, Yi)i=1,...,n are iid observations with the same distribution as (X,Y ), both the Lasso in linear regression and the logistic Lasso in logistic regression enjoy rate optimality: â€–Î²Ì‚ âˆ’ Î²âˆ—â€–2 â‰¤ s log(ep/s)/n; see [35, 1] or the proof of Proposition 3.4 in Appendix F for self-contained proofs. The latter estimation bound is optimal in a minimax sense and cannot 33rd Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2019), Vancouver, Canada. be improved, and the minimax rate s log(ep/s)/n represents the scale below which uncertainty is unavoidable by information theoretic arguments, see for instance [36, Section 5]. We are interested in providing first order expansion of Î²Ì‚ at scales negligible compared to the minimax estimation rate, e.g. at scales negligible compared to s log(ep/s)/n in the aforementioned sparsity contexts. To be more precise, the results below will construct random first order expansion Î· such that Î· is measurable w.r.t. a much smaller sigma algebra than that generated by (Xi, Yi)i=1,...,n, and â€–Î· âˆ’ Î²Ì‚â€–K = op(1)â€–Î²Ì‚ âˆ’ Î²â€–K for some norm â€– Â· â€–K related to the problem at hand, (2) where op(1) is a quantity that converges to 0 in probability. In other words, we provide a firstorder expansion of Î²Ì‚ similar to an influence function expansion, cf. Section 1. This allows for understanding bias and standard deviation of Î²Ì‚ at a finer scale than simply showing that Î²Ì‚ âˆ’ Î² converge to zero at the minimax rate. The present paper intends to answer the two questions below regarding such first order expansion. (Q1) How to construct Î· such that (2) holds for a given convex regularized estimator such as (1)? (Q2) How are such first order expansions useful in high-dimensional learning problems where convex regularized estimators (1) are commonly used? An expansion Î· satisfying (2) is interesting in and by itself because it describes phenomena at a finer scale than most of the literature in high-dimensional problems which focuses on minimax prediction and estimation bounds. More importantly, we will see in Section 4 that such first-order expansions lead to exact identities for the loss of estimators, and in Section 5 that such first-order expansions can be used for inference (i.e., uncertainty quantification) about the unknown coefficient vector Î². Notation. Throughout the paper, C1, C2, C3, ... denote positive absolute constants and we write a . b if a â‰¤ Cb for some absolute constant C > 0. The Euclidean norm in R or in R is denoted by â€– Â· â€–. For any positive definite matrix A, we write â€–uâ€–A = â€–A1/2uâ€– for the matrix square-root A. For matrices, â€– Â· â€–op and â€– Â· â€–F denote the operator norm and Frobenius norm. For any real a, a+ = max(0, a).

Safety in numbers and the spatial scaling of density-dependent mortality in a coral reef fish.,"In coral reef fishes, density-dependent population regulation is commonly mediated via predation on juveniles that have recently settled from the plankton. All else being equal, strong density-dependent mortality should select against the formation of high-density aggregations, yet the juveniles of many reef fishes aggregate. In light of this apparent contradiction, we hypothesized that the form and intensity of density dependence vary with the spatial scale of measurement. Individual groups might enjoy safety in numbers, but predators could still produce density-dependent mortality at larger spatial scales. We investigated this possibility using recently settled juvenile bluehead wrasse, Thalassoma bifasciatum, a small, aggregating reef fish. An initial caging experiment demonstrated that juvenile bluehead wrasse settlers suffer high predation, and spatial settlement patterns indicated that bluehead wrasse juveniles preferentially settle in groups, although they are also found singly. We then monitored the mortality of recently settled juveniles at two spatial scales: microsites, occupied by individual fish or groups of fish and separated by centimeters, and sites, consisting of approximately 2400-m2 areas of reef and separated by kilometers. At the microsite scale, we measured group size and effective population density independently and found that per capita mortality decreased with group size but was not related to density. At the larger spatial scale, however, per capita mortality increased with settler density. This shift in the form of density dependence with spatial scale could reconcile the existence of small-scale aggregative behavior typical of many reef fishes with the population-scale density dependence that is essential to population stability and persistence.",2007,Ecology
Identification of m6A-related genes and m6A RNA methylation regulators in pancreatic cancer and their association with survival.,"Background
N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification holds an important position in tumorigenesis and metastasis because it can change gene expression and even function in multiple levels including RNA splicing, stability, translocation and translation. In present study, we aim to conducted comprehensive investigation on m6A RNA methylation regulators and m6A-related genes in pancreatic cancer and their association with survival time.


Methods
Based on Univariate Cox regression analysis, protein-protein interaction analysis, LASSO Cox regression, a risk prognostic model, STRING, Spearman and consensus clustering analysis, data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) database was used to analyze 15 m6A RNA methylation regulators that were widely reported and 1,393 m6A-related genes in m6Avar.


Results
We found that 283 candidate m6A RNA methylation-related genes and 4 m6A RNA methylation regulatory factors, including RNA binding motif protein 15 (RBM15), methyltransferase like 14 (METTL14), fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO), and Î±-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase AlkB homolog 5 (ALKBH5), differed significantly among different stages of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system. Protein-protein interaction analysis indicated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), plectin-1 (PLEC), BLM RecQ like helicase (BLM), and polo like kinase 1 (PLK1) were closely related to other genes and could be considered as hub genes in the network. The results of LASSO Cox regression and the risk prognostic model indicated that AJCC stage, stage T and N, KRAS mutation status and x8q23.3 CNV fragment mutation differed significantly between the high-risk and the low-risk subgroups. The AUCs of 1 to 5 years after surgery were all more than 0.7 and increased year by year. Finally, we found KRAS mutation status and AJCC stage differed significantly among these groups after TCGA samples divided into subgroups with k=7. Moreover, we identified four m6A RNA methylation related genes expressed significantly differently among these seven subgroups, including collagen type VII alpha 1 chain (COL7A1), branched chain amino acid transaminase 1 (BCAT1), zinc finger protein 596 (ZNF596), and PLK1.


Conclusions
Our study systematically analyzed the m6A RNA methylation related genes, including expression, protein-protein interaction, potential function, and prognostic value and provides important clues to further research on the function of RNA m6A methylation and its related genes in pancreatic cancer.",2020,Annals of translational medicine
Nonnegative gridless compressive sensing for co-prime arrays,"The direction-of-arrival estimation in co-prime arrays is formulated as gridless compressive sensing where the atoms can be anywhere in a continuous domain. A new algorithm, successive-atom-merging cyclic coordinate descent for atomic norm minimization, is proposed. The algorithm performs atom update in subdomains of the continuous space relying on atom merging, exhibits fast convergence and has practically feasible computational complexity. It is demonstrated in simulations that the proposed method is superior to the joint sparsity reconstruction method (JLASSO) and the MUSIC method with spatial smoothing (SS-MUSIC) in terms of several criteria.",2016,2016 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)
"Digestive fungal flora in asymptomatic subjects in Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso.","OBJECTIVE
To identify Candida species in asymptomatic subjects in Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina Faso) by the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry.


METHODS
A cross-sectional study was conducted from January to February 2013 in Bobo-Dioulasso to collect fecal and urine specimens from voluntary donors. Fungal strains were isolated on Sabouraud dextrose agar and analyzed using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation-time-of-flight mass spectrometry.


RESULTS
A total of 135 samples including stools (78.5%, 106/135) and urine (21.5%, 29/135) were analyzed. The results revealed that fecal specimens contained mainly Candida krusei (C. krusei) (42.5%) followed by Candida albicans (29.3%), Candida glabrata (18.0%) and Candida tropicalis (C. tropicalis) (4.7%). C. krusei (34.6%) was also found to be the most frequently identified in urine samples followed by Candida albicans (27.0%), C. tropicalis (15.4%) and Candida parapsilosis. However, uncommon species such as Candida nivariensis, Candida kefyr, Candida norvegensis, Candida parapsilosis, Candida lusitaniae and Candida robusta were also identified from fecal and urines samples.


CONCLUSIONS
This study noted the emergence of species such as C. krusei, Candida glabrata, Candida parapsiolosis, C. tropicalis, Candida nivariensis, Candida norvegensis, and others. It is an imperative to take into account the existence of these species in the therapeutic management of patients in Bobo-Dioulasso.",2014,Asian Pacific journal of tropical biomedicine

Learning a nonlinear dynamical system model of gene regulation: A perturbed steady-state approach,"Biological structure and function depend on complex regulatory interactions between many genes. A wealth of gene expression data is available from high-throughput genome-wide measurement technologies, but effective gene regulatory network inference methods are still needed. Model-based methods founded on quantitative descriptions of gene regulation are among the most promising, but many such methods rely on simple, local models or on ad hoc inference approaches lacking experimental interpretability. We propose an experimental design and develop an associated statistical method for inferring a gene network by learning a standard quantitative, interpretable, predictive, biophysics-based ordinary differential equation model of gene regulation. We fit the model parameters using gene expression measurements from perturbed steady-states of the system, like those following overexpression or knockdown experiments. Although the original model is nonlinear, our design allows us to transform it into a convex optimization problem by restricting attention to steady-states and using the lasso for parameter selection. Here, we describe the model and inference algorithm and apply them to a synthetic six-gene system, demonstrating that the model is detailed and flexible enough to account for activation and repression as well as synergistic and self-regulation, and the algorithm can efficiently and accurately recover the parameters used to generate the data.",2013,The Annals of Applied Statistics
Nonstationary Panel Models with Latent Group Structures and Cross-Section Dependence,"This paper proposes a novel Lasso-based approach to handle unobserved parameter heterogeneity and cross-section dependence in nonstationary panel models. In particular, a penalized principal component (PPC) method is developed to estimate group-specific long-run relationships and unobserved common factors and jointly to identify the unknown group membership. The PPC estimators are shown to be consistent under weakly dependent innovation processes. But they suffer an asymptotically non-negligible bias from correlations between the nonstationary regressors and unobserved stationary common factors and/or the equation errors. To remedy these shortcomings we provide three bias-correction procedures under which the estimators are re-centered about zero as both dimensions (N and T) of the panel tend to infinity. We establish a mixed normal limit theory for the estimators of the group-specific long-run coefficients, which permits inference using standard test statistics. Simulations suggest the good finite sample performance of the proposed method. An empirical application applies the methodology to study international R&D spillovers and the results offer a convincing explanation for the growth convergence puzzle through the heterogeneous impact of R&D spillovers.",2019,
Feature selection with LASSO and VSURF to model mechanical properties for investment casting,"The service life of investment casting products is measured through its mechanical properties like ultimate tensile strength, yield strength, percentage elongation, hardness etc. These mechanical properties are procured through destructive testing which is time consuming and leads to material wastage. In the past, some machine learning models are utilized to predict the mechanical properties using the chemical composition and process parameters of the investment casting process. This industrial data contains a large number of input variables, which are complex to model and results in low prediction accuracy. In this proposed paper, two feature selection technique named least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and variable selection using random forests (VSURF) are implemented to select significant features from a total of 25 independent variables which are utilized for predicting the mechanical properties for the investment casting process. The efficacy of selected features is also evaluated by several machine learning models, including random forest (RF), K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm and extreme gradient boosting (XGBOOST). The results show that the VSURF can extract a smaller subset of critical variables compared to LASSO, which helps to enhance the prediction accuracy and interpretation of the machine learning models; XGBOOST has the best capability to predict mechanical properties with the highest accuracy.",2019,2019 International Conference on Computational Intelligence in Data Science (ICCIDS)

Real examples are used to demonstrate the analysis and forecasting performance in finite samples. Limit Theory for the Long Run Variance of Finite Markov Chains Peter R. Hansen (Univ. of North Carolina) Abstract: We consider the long-run variance, of a multivariate time series, Xt, where Xt is given from a homogeneous finite Markov chain. We show that the maximum likelihood estimator is consistent for and has a Gaussian limit distribution. The estimator can be motivated by a filtering approach that sheds additional light on the asymptotic variance and its components. We derive a consistent estimator of the asymptotic variance that facilitates inference and we compare the finite sample properties of three methods for inference, including a bootstrap implementation.

Forecasting Multiple Time Series with One-Sided Dynamic Principal Components Daniel PeÃ±a* (Univ. Carlos III de Madrid), Ezequiel Smucler and Victor J. Yohai Abstract: We define one-sided dynamic principal components (ODPC) for time series as linear combinations of the present and past values of the series that minimize the reconstruction mean squared error. Previous definitions of dynamic principal components depend on past and future values of the series. For this reason, they are not appropriate for forecasting purposes. On the contrary, it is shown that the ODPC introduced in this paper can be successfully used for forecasting highdimensional multiple time series. An alternating least squares algorithm to compute the proposed ODPC is presented. We prove that for stationary and ergodic time series the estimated values converge to their population analogues. We also prove that asymptotically, when both the number of series and the sample size go to infinity, if the data follows a dynamic factor model, the reconstruction obtained with ODPC converges, in mean squared error, to the common part of the factor model.

On Optimal Dimension Reduction for High-Dimensional and Functional Time Series Marc Hallin (Univ. libre de Bruxelles) Abstract: Dimension reduction techniques are at the core of the statistical analysis of highdimensional and functional observations. Whether the data are vectoror function-valued, principal component techniques, in this context, play a central role. The success of principal components in the dimension reduction problem is explained by the fact that, for any~$K\leq p$, the K first coefficients in the expansion of a p-dimensional random vector~${\bf X}$ in terms of its principal components is providing the best linear K-dimensional summary of~$\bf X$ in the mean square sense. The same property holds true for a random function and its functional principal component expansion. This optimality feature, however, no longer holds true in a time series context: principal components and functional principal components, when the observations are serially dependent, are losing their optimal dimension reduction property to the so-called dynamic principal components introduced by Brillinger in 1981 in the vector case and, in the functional case, their functional extension proposed by H\""ormann, Kidzi\'nski and Hallin in 2015 (Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series B 77, 319-348.

On the asymptotic non-null behavior of high-dimensional spherical location tests Davy Paindaveine (Univ. libre de Bruxelles) Abstract: In the Fisher-von Mises-Langevin model, we consider the high-dimensional version of the spherical location testing problem, that is, we want to test the null hypothesis that the modal location theta coincides with a given value theta_0 on the p-dimensional unit sphere, with p large. It is well-known that, in standard situations where the dimension p and the underlying concentration kappa are fixed, the Watson test is asymptotically optimal. In [2], we investigated whether or not this extends to the case where the concentration kappa=\kappa_n goes to zero as n goes to infinity. In the present work, we consider, as in [1], the high-dimensional setup where the dimension p_n goes to infinity with n. We allow the concentration kappa_n to behave in a completely free way with n, which offers a complete spectrum of problems ranging from arbitrarily challenging to arbitrarily easy 8 problems. We identify five different regimes, depending on the convergence/divergence properties of kappa_n, that yield different limiting asymptotic experiments. Asymptotically optimal tests are obtained in each regime. [1] Chr. Cutting, D. Paindaveine, and Th.

The large-volume detector (LVD) of the Gran Sasso Laboratory,"SummaryWe describe here the LVD experiment (Large-Volume Detector) of the Gran Sasso Laboratory, which is the natural improvement of the LSD experiment (Liquid Scintillation Detector) running in the Mont Blanc Laboratory. The LVD ((31Ã—13) m2 area, height 12 m) consists of â‰ˆ1800 tons of liquid scintillator and of a system of streamer tubes on 5 layers for reconstructing tracks of charged particles. As any experiment in an underground laboratory, which has a low statistics of events and requires long running times, the LVD is a multipurpose experiment but with different priorities of the researches. The main goal is neutrino astronomy, firstly detection of neutrinos from collapsing stars and secondly high-energy neutrinos and solar neutrinos. Since the expected number of interactions of neutrinos, from a stellar collapse is very high (of order of 900 for a collapse at the distance of the galactic centre), the LVD is, contrary to the present experiments, a real neutrino observatory, able to make a detailed analysis of the energy and temporal distributions of the burst. In addition to neutrino astrophysics, with the LVD experiment excellent possibilities exist to perform researches in cosmic-ray and high-energy elementary-particle physics.RiassuntoSi descrive l'esperimento LVD (Large Volume Detector) del laboratorio del Gran Sasso, che rappresenta il naturale sviluppo dell'esperimento LSD (Liquid Scintillation Detector) in funzione nel laboratorio del Monte Bianco. LVD (area (31Ã—13) m2, altezza 12 m) consiste di âˆ¼1800 tonnellate di scintillatore liquido e di un sistema di tubi a streamer su 5 piani per la ricostruzione delle tracce di particelle cariche. Come tutti gli esperimenti in laboratori sotterranei, che sono a tempi lunghi ed a bassa statistica, l'esperimento LVD Ã¨ a multiscopi ma con diverse prioritÃ  delle ricerche. L'obiettivo principale Ã¨ l'astronomia neutrinica, in primo luogo la rivelazione di neutrini da collassi gravitazionali stellari, e poi neutrini di alta energia e neutrini solari. Dato l'alto numero previsto di interazioni di neutrini (âˆ¼900 per un collasso alla distanza del centro galattico) da stelle collassanti, l'esperimento LVD costituisce, a differenza degli attuali esperimenti, un vero e proprio osservatorio neutrinico, in grado di compiere un'analisi dettagliata delle distribuzioni energetica e temporale del burst. Oltre all'astrofisica neutrinica, con l'esperimento LVD si possono compiere ricerche in fisica della radiazione cosmica e di particelle elementari ad altissime energie.Ð ÐµÐ·ÑŽÐ¼ÐµÐ’ Ð´Ð°Ð½Ð½Ð¾Ð¹ Ñ€Ð°Ð±Ð¾Ñ‚Ðµ Ð¾Ð¿Ð¸ÑÑ‹Ð²Ð°ÐµÑ‚ÑÑ Ð·ÐºÑÐ¿ÐµÑ€Ð¸Ð¼ÐµÐ½Ñ‚ LVD (Large Volume Detector), ÐºÐ¾Ñ‚Ð¾Ñ€Ñ‹Ð¹ Ð±ÑƒÐ´ÐµÑ‚ Ð¿Ñ€Ð¾Ð²Ð¾Ð´Ð¸Ñ‚ÑŒÑÑ Ð² Ð»Ð°Ð±Ð¾Ñ€Ð°Ñ‚Ð¾Ñ€Ð¸Ð¸ Ð“Ñ€Ð°Ð½ Cacco.

Multichannel Source Separation and Speech Enhancement Using the Convolutive Transfer Function,"This paper addresses the problem of audio source recovery from multichannel noisy convolutive mixture for source separation and speech enhancement, assuming known mixing filters. We propose to conduct the source recovery in the short-time Fourier transform domain, and based on the convolutive transfer function (CTF) approximation. Compared to the time domain filters, CTF has much less taps, and thus less near-common zeros among channels and less computational complexity. This work proposes three source recovery methods, i) the multichannel inverse filtering method, i.e. multiple input/output inverse theorem (MINT), is exploited in the CTF domain, and for the multisource case, ii) a beamforming-like multichannel inverse filtering method is proposed appling the single source MINT and power minimization, which is suitable for the case that not the CTFs of all the sources are known, iii) a constrained Lasso method. The sources are recovered by minimizing their $\ell_1$-norm to impose the spectral sparsity, with the constraint that the $\ell_2$-norm fitting cost between the microphone signals and the mixture model involving the unknown source signals is less than a tolerance. The noise can be reduced by setting the tolerance to the noise power. Experiments under various acoustic conditions are conducted to evaluate the three proposed methods. The comparison among them and with the baseline methods are presented.",2017,ArXiv
Ãœber die AbhÃ¤ngigkeit zwischen der Dispersion von Farbstoffen und deren Adsorption durch brikettierte Kohlen,"Zusammenfassung1.Die Adsorption der Farbstoffe PikrinsÃ¤ure Methylenblau, Neutralrot, Tropeolin 00, Eosin, Kristallviolett und Kongorot aus wÃ¤sserigen LÃ¶sungen durch brikettierte Torfkohlen ist abhÃ¤ngig vom DispersitÃ¤tsgrad des Farbstoffes. Das Adsorptionsmaximum wird bei molekulardispersen Farbstoffen, das Minimum bei kolloiden Farbstoffen beobachtet. Die halbkolloiden Farbstoffe nehmen eine Mittelstellung ein.2.Mit der Druckzunahme beim Brikettieren der Kohle erreicht die Adsorption der Farbstoffe ihr Maximum bei einem Druck von 300 kg/qcm. Die Beschaffenheit brikettierter Kohlen kann vom Gesichtspunkt der Polanyi'schen Potentialtheorie erklÃ¤rt werden, indem von dem Gesetz ausgegangen wird:Îµ=B/W3.3.Ein direkter Zusammenhang zwischen Molekulargewicht und dem Grad der Adsorption durch brikettierte Kohlen wird bei molekulardispersen Farbstoffen nicht beobachtet, was entweder der sauren bzw. basischen Natur des Farbstoffes oder partieller MolekÃ¼lassoziation der einzelnen Farbstoffe zugeschrieben werden kann.",1936,Kolloid-Zeitschrift

Interactive information sharing system using large 3D geometric models,"Recent advances in digital archiving technologies allow us to obtain and store many kinds of precious data in large quantities. Such archived data can be utilized for a variety of fields. These include not only archaeological research, but also tourism and education. However, it is difficult for the ordinary populace to effectively use such data because utilization needs a high degree of expertise. Sensing and modeling technologies for 3D digital archiving have also advanced dramatically, so we can obtain dense 3D geometric data of large-scale cultural heritage objects around the world. These obtained 3D models can be utilized much more effectively than other conventional data because highly dense 3D models contain all geometrically meaningful features from the entire object to the detail. Thus, through multiresolution, which allows the generation, representation, and manipulation of geometric objects at different levels of detail, these models can seamlessly represent all such features. But the question remains: how can an ordinary user access these objects? In this thesis, we introduce a novel system in which ordinary users can access geometric data connected with cultural assets by using dense 3D models as visual interfaces. Our system has two major functions: (1) to associate information with a meaningful region of the 3D model, and (2) to display information associated with the target 3D model in real time. To realize this system, we need an efficient rendering method that displays complex scenes to users from all viewpoints in real time. Additionally, an interactive tool is required to allow users to select 3D regions on the model speedily and accurately. We also need these models to be accessible through the Internet for the purposes of sharing data with multiple users. In the first part of this thesis, we propose efficient rendering methods that we have modified for large 3D models in offline environments. Second, we introduce the interactive selection tool. And finally, we propose a client-server model as a rendering method that allows the models to be viewed through the Internet. First, we propose several efficient rendering methods that we have adapted to realize an interactive display system for large 3D models. We first examine a model-based method that reconstructs large models into hierarchical geometric data in a multiresolutional form that can be processed in real time. We then propose a point-based method referred to as â€œSequential Point Clustersâ€ that sequentializes data structure and optimizes it for GPU programming. And, additionally, we propose a polygon-based method that is more applicable to graphcut selection and interactive rendering. We then mainly evaluate these rendering methods for the rendering speed and versatility. Second, regarding our interactive selection tool, this enables users to select complex regions on huge 3D models. It is difficult for users to select arbitrary features easily and accurately by using conventional tools such as a lasso tool. By applying a graph-cut algorithm that allows users to select 3D regions as links instead of 3D points, we have devised an interactive tool that is an extension of a traditional lasso. We evaluate the usability of this system and compare it with other tools through a user study. Finally, we propose a rendering method using a client-server model through the Internet to extend the proposed interactive tool to a network environment. Our proposed method is based on a hybrid method that we refer to as â€œGridLumigraph,â€ which uses not only model-based data but also image-based data for efficient data transfer and image accuracy. In our proposed design, the rendering server stores model-based LOD data and preprocessed image data. Then the client receives the data depending on the viewpoint, and renders arbitrary 3D scenes by using both types of data. We then evaluate the rendering speed and network load. Our system proposed in this thesis is different from any other previous proposed systems, and allows users to associate information with very huge 3D models and display interactively. This system gives large contributions to a wide variety of fields likes of archaeology, and each method proposed in this thesis is applicable for many kinds of applications.",2010,

Short-Term Forecasting with Mixed-Frequency Data: A MIDASSO Approach,"In this paper we extend the targeted-regressor approach suggested in Bai and Ng (2008) for variables sampled at the same frequency to mixed-frequency data. Our MIDASSO approach is a combination of the unrestricted MIxed-frequency DAta-Sampling approach (U-MIDAS) (see Foroni et al., 2015; Castle et al., 2009; Bec and Mogliani, 2013), and the LASSO-type penalised regression used in Bai and Ng (2008), called the elastic net (Zou and Hastie, 2005). We illustrate our approach by forecasting the quarterly real GDP growth rate in Switzerland.",2017,Applied Economics
A signature of tumor immune microenvironment genes associated with the prognosis of nonâ€‘small cell lung cancer.,"Establishing a prognostic genetic signature closely related to the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) to predict clinical outcomes is necessary. Using the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database of a nonâ€‘small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cohort and the immune score derived from the Estimation of Stromal and Immune cells in Malignant Tumours using Expression data (ESTIMATE) algorithm, we applied the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression model to screen a 10â€‘gene signature among the 448 differentially expressed genes and found that the risk prediction models constructed by 10 genes could be more sensitive to prognosis than TNM (Tumor, Lymph node and Metastasis) stage (P=0.006). The CIBERSORT method was applied to quantify the relative levels of different immune cell types. It was found that the ratio of eosinophils, mast cells (MCs) resting and CD4 T cells memory activated in the lowâ€‘risk group was higher than that in the highâ€‘risk group, and the difference was statistically significant (P=0.003, P=0.014 and P=0.018, respectively). Inconsistently, the ratio of resting natural killer (NK) cells and activated plasma cells in the lowâ€‘risk group was significantly lower than that in the highâ€‘risk group (P=0.05 and P=0.009, respectively). Kaplanâ€‘Meier survival results showed that patients of the highâ€‘risk group had significantly shorter overall survival (OS) than those of the lowâ€‘risk group in the training set (P<0.001). Furthermore, Kaplanâ€‘Meier survival showed that patients of the highâ€‘risk group had significantly shorter OS than those of the lowâ€‘risk group (P=0.0025 and P=0.0157, respectively) in the validation set [GSE31210 and TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas)]. The 10â€‘gene signature was found to be an independent risk factor for prognosis in univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analyses (P<0.001). In addition, it was found that the risk model constructed by the 10â€‘gene signature was related to the clinical related factors in logistic regression analysis. The genetic signature closely related to the immune microenvironment was found to be able to predict differences in the proportion of immune cells (eosinophils, resting MCs, memory activated CD4 T cells, resting NK cells and plasma cells) in the risk model. Our findings suggest that the genetic signature closely related to TIME could predict the prognosis of NSCLC patients, and provide some reference for immunotherapy.",2020,Oncology reports
Approximating UAV and Vision Feature Point Correlations in a Simplified SLAM problem,"Navigation with a range sensor and vision aided inertial measurement unit (IMU) estimation is difficult in Global Positioning System (GPS) denied environments. Ignoring vision feature point and vehicle state correlations contributes to inaccuracy and filter inconsistency. Approximation of feature point and vehicle cross correlation terms would allow the accuracy and consistency comparable to a correlated solution whilst reducing operation count and allowing for decoupled filter design. A Monte-Carlo simulation for a two dimensional bearing to feature point approximation of the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem was developed. The results of a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression were then used to estimate cross covariance terms. A 1000 trial simulation showed that the regression solution was comparable in accuracy and consistency to the fully correlated solution. Future developments have the potential to provide a more accurate, approximately correlated SLAM solution to bound IMU drift for UAVs operating in a GPS denied environment.",2019,2019 International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (ICUAS)
