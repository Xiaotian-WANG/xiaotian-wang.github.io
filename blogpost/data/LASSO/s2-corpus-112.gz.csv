Sparse BD-Net,"In this work, we propose a multiplication-less binarized depthwise-separable convolution neural network, called BD-Net. BD-Net is designed to use binarized depthwise separable convolution block as the drop-in replacement of conventional spatial-convolution in deep convolution neural network (DNN). In BD-Net, the computation-expensive convolution operations (i.e., Multiplication and Accumulation) are converted into energy-efficient Addition/Subtraction operations. For further compressing the model size while maintaining the dominant computation in addition/subtraction, we propose a brand-new sparse binarization method with a hardware-oriented structured sparsity pattern. To successfully train such sparse BD-Net, we propose and leverage two techniques: (1) a modified group-lasso regularization whose group size is identical to the capacity of basic computing core in accelerator and (2) a weight penalty clipping technique to solve the disharmony issue between weight binarization and lasso regularization. The experiment results show that the proposed sparse BD-Net can achieve comparable or even better inference accuracy, in comparison to the full precision CNN baseline. Beyond that, a BD-Net customized process-in-memory accelerator is designed using SOT-MRAM, which owns characteristics of high channel expansion flexibility and computation parallelism. Through the detailed analysis from both software and hardware perspectives, we provide an intuitive design guidance for software/hardware co-design of DNN acceleration on mobile embedded systems. Note that this journal submission is the extended version of our previous published paper in ISVLSI 2018 [24].",2020,ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems (JETC)

"Poster: Brush, lasso, or magic wand? Picking the right tool for large-scale multiple object selection tasks","Selection of multiple objects is a frequent interaction task in virtual environments. Accomplishing this task efficiently and intuitively is difficult, especially in cases where there are a very large number of objects to be selected. In this work, we seek to investigate two well-known techniques, a spherical brush and a box-shaped lasso for multiple object selection (MOS), and compare them to a new MOS technique, which we have named the magic wand. This new technique automates a lot the work, which the user would normally have to do manually. The comparison is made through a user study, where users are presented with a range of different geometric layouts of selection targets, to investigate the pros and cons of each of the MOS techniques. The evaluation shows that the magic wand is significantly faster to use than the other techniques, however the quality of the magic wand's selections is highly dependent on the geometric scenario. The spherical brush proved to be a good overall technique, whereas the box lasso proved slow and inaccurate even in geometric scenarios specifically designed for the lasso.",2012,2012 IEEE Symposium on 3D User Interfaces (3DUI)

Thalassomyxa canariensis n. sp. from a tide pool of Tenerife (Canary Islands),"Summary The new species, Thalassomyxa canariensis n. sp. from a tide pool on the northeastern coast of Tenerife (Canary Islands) differs from Thalassomyxa jamaicensis (Grell 1992 a, b) by the spongy structure of its cytoplasm that becomes discernible in the motile stages after feeding with diatoms. The obligatory change of two phases and the capability of the resting stages to undergo binary divisions before and multipartite fissions (plasmotomy) after fusion are similar in both species.",1994,Archiv fÃ¼r Protistenkunde
"Race vis-Ã -vis Latitude: Their Influence on Intelligence, Infectious Diseases, and Income","Fuerst and Kirkegaard (this issue) have done a Herculean job in generating data on the relationships existing between European ancestry and complex cognitive ability (CCA) - the construct measured by IQ scores and/or student achievements in math, reading, and/or science (Rindermann, 2007) - simultaneously considering infectious diseases, socioeconomic outcomes, and other variables in several American countries. Their analytic approach is rigorous and includes lasso regression. But their findings contradict the results of a ministudy of 11 large American countries in which both European ancestry and absolute latitude determined national PISA scores; in that study, whereas the cognitive effects of absolute latitude remained significant when European ancestry was controlled, those of ancestry lost significance when absolute latitude was controlled (Leon, 2015b). Hence, rather than commenting their valuable paper, I decided to resolve the empirical issue by generating new evidence at a higher level of analysis. Neither the study by Leon (2015b) of 11 countries nor the Fuerst and Kirkegaard study of USA state data distinguished between exogenous and endogenous variables. I decided to use fully saturated path models entailing two exogenous and three endogenous variables and targeted US states because in this country latitude has been found to correlate with CCA (Kanazawa, 2006; Leon, 2015a; McDaniel, 2006a, 2006b; Pesta & Posnanski, 2014; Ryan, Bartels, & Townsend, 2010) and other relevant variables, such as infectious diseases (Eppig, Fincher, & Thornhill, 2011), income per capita (Ram, 1999), as well as the seroprevalence of infectious diseases (McQuillan et al., 2004) and georesidential pattern of Whites vis-a-vis African Americans and Hispanics (U.S. Census, 2010). Whereas the percentage of Whites is higher in the northern than southern United States, these minorities are more demographically important in the southern U.S.I calculated the percentage of Whites in each of the 48 contiguous U.S. states using data from the U.S. Census (2010), which uses self-identification. Other important categories are African American, Hispanic, Native American, East Asian, and Pacific Islander. The latitude of each capital city was obtained from the World Atlas (2015). Math and reading scores from male and female publicschool students in 4thand 8thgrade are from the most recent report of the National Assessment of Educational Progress, corresponding to 2013 (NAEP, 2015). Data on income per capita came from the U.S. Department of Commerce (2015). Finally, I incorporated measurements of prevalence of infectious diseases per state from a standardized Parasite Stress USA index encompassing cholera, measles, meningitis, pertussis, rubella, tetanus, and tuberculosis in 1993-2007 (Eppig, Fincher & Thornhill, 2011; Fincher & Thornhill, 2012). I did not include more variables to avoid problems of multicollinearity with a small number of observations.Percent White is treated as an exogenous variable in the path analyses because the causes of its distribution in the U.S. territory are historical and unrelated to the other variables in the path models; the earliest English immigrants settled in the U.S. northeast in the 16th century because it was close to England, and then moved south and west; they were followed by immigration from Africa into the rural South because slaves were needed in the cotton plantations, while Hispanics came later, mainly from Mexico and Cuba into the southern U.S. because they came from places south of the U.S.In all figures, I use+ pâ‰¤ .10, * p â‰¤ .05, **p â‰¤ .01, and ***p â‰¤ .001. The results shown in Figure 1 reveal that CCA is influenced only by latitude, whereas income is determined positively by CCA and negatively by Percent White. The latter finding can be understood considering that the White population is most prevalent in the U.S. northwest and north-midwest, that is, states with low population density and scarce natural resources (see Fig. â€¦",2016,Mankind Quarterly

New Permian Crinoids from the Battleship Wash Patch Reef in Southern Nevada,"Abstract The small crinoidal patch reef in the Bird Spring Formation near the mouth of Battleship Wash, Clark County, Nevada, has yielded the largest Early Permian crinoid fauna known in North America. Earlier studies of the fauna were based on 535 specimens. Additional collecting has yielded another 239 specimens. These new specimens provide new information about some of the earlier described species and include three new genera and seven new species, bringing the total recognized in the Battleship Wash fauna to 37 genera and 62 species. Representatives of the camerates, disparids, primitive cladids (cyathocrinitids and dendrocrinids), advanced cladids (formerly poteriocriniids), flexibles, and articulates are recognized in the Battleship Wash fauna. Of particular significance among these new specimens is the presence of an actinocrinid. A specimen formerly identified from the fauna is here recognized as an articulate. This is the first report of an actinocrinid and an articulate from the Permian of North America. Based on the abundance of large specimens of cladids with 10 or more arms, the Battleship Wash fauna is interpreted to have lived in a nearshore high energy shelf environment, which agrees with the paleogeographic position previously recognized for the Bird Spring Formation. New taxa introduced are: Poteriocrinites permicus n. sp., Bridgerocrinidae n. fam., Ekteinocrinus battleshipensis n. gen. and sp., Arroyocrius brachiatus n. sp., Plummericrinus jelli n. sp., Plummericrinus? bulbosus n. sp., Aesiocrinidae n. fam., Elassocrinus cyathus n. gen. and sp., Oklahomacrinus triangulus n. sp., and Pentaxocrinus quinarius n. gen. and comb.",2007,
Reconstructing changing sediment sources in a Mediterranean mountain river catchment using composite sediment fingerprinting,"gduz catchment in the western part of the territory of Sagalassos, Taurus Mountain range, 100 km north of Antalya, is being investigated for the impact of climate change and human activity on sediment sources in a Mediterranean setting. Ninety-four cores were taken within the alluvial plain, and numerous topsoil samples were taken over the entire catchment. For reconstructing the changing sediment sources over time, several fingerprinting methods are applied. Lithologies present in the gravel fraction > 2 mm and mineral content of the sand fraction, 2mm<x<63 m serve as qualitative tracers. In contrast, the silt/clay fraction < 63 m is geochemically analyzed, and the measured elements serve as quantitative tracers. The BuË˜ gduz catchment was divided in four subareas based on sedimentological and geomorphological factors, and the mineralogical composition of the sediment differs considerably between the various subareas, at least for the most recent sedimentation phase. Moreover, the carbonate content of the alluvial sediments increases significantly in downstream direction, suggesting the importance of local sediment sources.

Distributed Coordinate Descent Method for Learning with Big Data,"In this paper we develop and analyze Hydra: HYbriD cooRdinAte descent method for solving loss minimization problems with big data. We initially partition the coordinates (features) and assign each partition to a different node of a cluster. At every iteration, each node picks a random subset of the coordinates from those it owns, independently from the other computers, and in parallel computes and applies updates to the selected coordinates based on a simple closed-form formula. We give bounds on the number of iterations sufficient to approximately solve the problem with high probability, and show how it depends on the data and on the partitioning. We perform numerical experiments with a LASSO instance described by a 3TB matrix.",2016,J. Mach. Learn. Res.
"Redescription of Petasiger exaeretus Dietz, 1909 and P. phalacrocoracis (Yamaguti, 1939) (Trematoda: Echinostomatidae), parasites of cormorants","Two echinostome trematodes of the genus Petasiger, P. exaeretus Dietz, 1909 and P. phalacrocoracis (Yamaguti, 1939), parasitising cormorants (Phalacrocoracidae), were found in Phalacrocorax carbo L. from the Czech Republic. Both taxa are redescribed and literary data on their occurence in cormorants are reviewed. The species P. exaeretus appears to be a rather rare species, hitherto recorded in Phalacrocorax carbo in Europe, Kirghizia and Azerbaidzhan. P. baschkirovi Ablassov & Iksanov, 1959 is synonymized with P. exaeretus. P. phalacrocoracis (syn. P. hospitale (Mendheim, 1940) and P. exaeretus auct. nec Dietz, 1909), which has previously been misidentified and erroneously designated as P. exaeretus, appears to be the commonest species of the genus, parasitising cormorants in the Palaearctic Region (Europe, CIS [USSR], Japan) and in Australia.

Quasi-Newton-Type Continuation Method for Nonlinear Receding Horizon Control,"A fast computational method of nonlinear receding horizon control is proposed, based on the continuation method combined with the quasi-Newton method. Jacobians in the differential equation of the unknown costate are replaced by their estimates, and the quasi-Newton method is employed to determine time derivatives of those estimates. Several modieed algorithms are obtained by imposing different conditions. The proposed method leads to considerable reduction of computational load compared to the conventional algorithms. Numerical examples of a two-wheeled car and a tethered satellite demonstrate computational time, accuracy, and robustness against noises of the proposed method. controlLyapunovfunctionstostabilizeaclassofnonlinearsystems. A controller designed by backstepping can also be interpreted asan optimal controller in terms of the inverse optimal control problem. 2 However, backstepping does not give a synthesis method to min- imize a performance index specie ed by a designer. Therefore, di- rect optimization methods for a given performance index should be explored. In the direct optimization of a controller, one has to solve the Hamilton- Jacobi-Bellman equation (HJBE). There have been nu- merous efforts to solve the HJBE. Because the HJBE is a partial differential equation for the optimal cost function, its solution has to be given over a some region in the state space. The structure of the solution is usually assumed for the HJBE, for example, in the form of power series, 3 interpolation, 4 or expansion with basis functions. 5 There is also a possibility of an approximate solution technique that does not assume the structure of the solution in the framework of genetic programming. 6 However, those methods can- not avoid the explosive growth of data storage or number of terms for high-dimensional systems and are dife cult to implement for a system whose dimension is higher than two or three. Ontheotherhand, iftheoptimalcontrolinputiscalculatedonline onlyfor thecurrentstate,ahugeamountofdata storageisnotneces- sary, even for a high-dimensional system. In this case, anopen-loop optimalcontrolproblem,whichleadstoatwo-pointboundary-value problem (TPBVP), is solved in place of the HJBE. Receding hori- zon control (model predictive control) is one of such control tech- niques. In receding horizon control, a e nite horizon performance index with a moving initial time and a moving terminal time ismin- imized. Receding horizon control is attractive from the theoretical point of view because it guarantees closed-loop stability, ifthe state isconstrained tobe zero at the end of the horizon, 7;8 or ifother con- ditions are satise ed. 9i13 Those characteristics concerning stability give guidelines for problem setting and selection of a performance index.",2002,Journal of Guidance Control and Dynamics
Sparse distance learning for object recognition combining RGB and depth information,"In this work we address joint object category and instance recognition in the context of RGB-D (depth) cameras. Motivated by local distance learning, where a novel view of an object is compared to individual views of previously seen objects, we define a view-to-object distance where a novel view is compared simultaneously to all views of a previous object. This novel distance is based on a weighted combination of feature differences between views. We show, through jointly learning per-view weights, that this measure leads to superior classification performance on object category and instance recognition. More importantly, the proposed distance allows us to find a sparse solution via Group-Lasso regularization, where a small subset of representative views of an object is identified and used, with the rest discarded. This significantly reduces computational cost without compromising recognition accuracy. We evaluate the proposed technique, Instance Distance Learning (IDL), on the RGB-D Object Dataset, which consists of 300 object instances in 51 everyday categories and about 250,000 views of objects with both RGB color and depth. We empirically compare IDL to several alternative state-of-the-art approaches and also validate the use of visual and shape cues and their combination.",2011,2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation
Pulmonary vein conduction is the major finding in patients with atrial tachyarrhythmias after intraoperative maze ablation.,"INTRODUCTION
Electrophysiological (EP) data from patients with recurrent atrial tachyarrhythmias (ATa) after intraoperative maze ablation are limited. Furthermore, the clinical course after accomplishing pulmonary vein (PV) isolation using the double lasso technique (DLT) is unknown.


METHODS AND RESULTS
EP study and catheter ablation (CA) was guided by a three-dimensional electroanatomic mapping system (3-D EA, CARTO, Biosense-Webster) combined with simultaneous ipsilateral PV mapping using the DLT. Defined endpoints were: (1) identification of conduction gaps within the ipsilateral PVs, (2) elimination of all PV spikes, and (3) ablation of clinical ATas. CA was performed in eight patients (four females, 62 +/- 5 years, LA: 50 +/- 6 mm) with drug refractory ATa (9.1 +/- 6.3 years) despite non-""cut and sew"" maze operation. Electrical PV conduction was demonstrated in the majority of patients (7/8). All endpoints were achieved. Repeat ablations were required in three patients. Second ablation was due to typical atrial flutter (n = 1) and atrial fibrillation (n = 2). One patient required three ablations due to a left atrial macroreentrant tachycardia. During a mean follow-up of 15.5 +/- 4.8 months, 7/8 patients were free of ATa recurrences.


CONCLUSION
Incomplete lesions after non-""cut and sew"" maze operation are associated with PV conduction and recurrence of ATas. Electrical isolation of ipsilateral PVs and completion of linear lesions guided by 3-D EA mapping is feasible and successful in maintaining sinus rhythm during mid term follow-up. Completeness of linear lesions using EP endpoints should be confirmed during the initial surgical procedure to minimize ATa recurrences.",2007,Journal of cardiovascular electrophysiology
An Evolutionary Approach to Emotional Communication,"The study of pragmatics is typically concerned with ostensive communication (especially through language), in which we not only provide evidence for our intended speaker meaning, but also make manifest our intention to do so. This is not, however, the only way in which humans communicate. We also communicate in many non-ostensive ways, and these expressions often interplay with and complement ostensive communication. For example, fear, embarrassment, surprise and other emotions are often expressed with linguistic expressions, which they complement through changes in prosodic cues, facial and bodily muscular configuration, pupil dilatation and skin colouration, among others. However, some basic but important questions about non-ostensive communication, in particular those concerned with evolutionary stability, are unaddressed. Our objective is to address, albeit tentatively, this issue, focusing our discussion on one particular class of non-ostensive communication: emotional expressions. We argue that existing solutions to the problemofstabilityofemotionalcommunicationareproblematicandwesuggestintroducinganewclassofmechanisms---mechanismsof",2013,Journal of Pragmatics

The Doctrine of Reconciliation,"I. Reconciliation is a Phase 1 (salvation) doctrine emphasizing the removal of the barrier between God and man that resulted from the fall. Eph.2:1417 ""For He Himself is our peace (reconciliation) who made both parties one, and broke down the barrier of the dividing wall, by abolishing in His flesh (Phase 2) the enmity, the law of commandments contained in ordinances, that in Himself (positional truth) He might make the two into one new man, thus establishing peace, and might reconcile them (potential positive volition) both in one body to God through the cross, by it having put to death the enmity. And He came (incarnation) and preached peace (Doctrine of Reconciliation) to you who were far away (gentiles outside the Mosaic Covenant), and peace to those who were near (Jews)."" II. The concept of reconciliation. A. In reconciliation, mankind is viewed as the enemy of God, Rom.5:10 ""For if while we were enemies (evcqro,j, echthros) we were reconciled to God by the death of His Son."" B. The barrier between God and man is called ""enmity"" (evcqra, echthra), Eph.2:15,16. C. The removal of the barrier is known Biblically as ""reconciliation"", 2Cor.5:18; Eph.2:16; Col.1:20,21. III. Greek vocabulary. A. Noun, katallagh, katallage: reconciliation. B. Verb, katalla,ssw, katallasso: to reconcile. C. Verb, avpokatalla,ssw, apokatallasso: to reconcile. D. Noun, eivrh,nh, eirene: peace (Phase 1 context). E. Noun, e;cqra, echthra: enmity, a technical word for the barrier. F. Noun, evcqro,j, echthros: enemy. IV. The doctrine of reconciliation was portrayed in the Old Testament through the peace offerings, Lev.3; 6:30; 7:37,38; 8:15. V. The basis of reconciliation is the Cross, Eph.2:16 ""and might reconcile them both to God through the cross, by it having put to death the enmity""; Col.1:20. VI. The person of reconciliation is Jesus Christ, 2Cor.5:18,19. VII. The mechanics of reconciliation involves the removal of the barrier and faith in Christ. A. The barrier consisted of personal sins, Rom.3:23. B. Christ's death for the sins of all men removed this barrier, 1Jn.2:2. C. With the barrier removed, what stands between God and man is Christ, who removed it, Jn.3:18; 10:9; 14:6. D. Acceptance of the work of Christ on the Cross (faith in Christ) secures reconciliation for the individual, Jn.3:16,18; cp. 2Cor.5:19a; Col.1:20. VIII. The ministry of reconciliation, 2Cor.5:18-20a ""Now all things are from God, who reconciled us to Himself through Christ, and gave us the ministry of reconciliation ...therefore we are ambassadors for Christ."" IX. The message of reconciliation is the gospel, 2Cor.5:19 ""and He has committed to us the word of reconciliation."" X. The challenge of reconciliation is Phase 2 reconciliation, wherein the believer must respond to God's initiative and reconcile himself to God by isolating his STA (sinful trend of Adam) and acclimating to doctrine in Phase 2, 2Cor.5:20b ""be reconciled to God.""",1919,The Biblical World
Evaluation of digital soil mapping approaches with large sets of environmental covariates,"Abstract. The spatial assessment of soil functions requires maps of basic soil properties. Unfortunately, these are either missing for many regions or are not available at the desired spatial resolution or down to the required soil depth. The field-based generation of large soil datasets and conventional soil maps remains costly. Meanwhile, legacy soil data and comprehensive sets of spatial environmental data are available for many regions. Digital soil mapping (DSM) approaches relating soil data (responses) to environmental data (covariates) face the challenge of building statistical models from large sets of covariates originating, for example, from airborne imaging spectroscopy or multi-scale terrain analysis. We evaluated six approaches for DSM in three study regions in Switzerland (Berne, Greifensee, ZH forest) by mapping the effective soil depth available to plants (SD), pH, soil organic matter (SOM), effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC), clay, silt, gravel content and fine fraction bulk density for four soil depths (totalling 48 responses). Models were built from 300â€“500Â environmental covariates by selecting linear models through (1)Â grouped lasso and (2)Â an ad hoc stepwise procedure for robust external-drift kriging (georob). For (3)Â geoadditive models we selected penalized smoothing spline terms by component-wise gradient boosting (geoGAM). We further used two tree-based methods: (4)Â boosted regression trees (BRTs) and (5)Â random forest (RF). Lastly, we computed (6)Â weighted model averages (MAs) from the predictions obtained from methodsÂ 1â€“5. Lasso, georob and geoGAM successfully selected strongly reduced sets of covariates (subsets of 3â€“6â€‰% of all covariates). Differences in predictive performance, tested on independent validation data, were mostly small and did not reveal a single best method for 48Â responses. Nevertheless, RF was often the best among methods 1â€“5 (28 of 48Â responses), but was outcompeted by MA for 14 of these 28Â responses. RF tended to over-fit the data. The performance of BRT was slightly worse than RF. GeoGAM performed poorly on some responses and was the best only for 7 of 48Â responses. The prediction accuracy of lasso was intermediate. All models generally had small bias. Only the computationally very efficient lasso had slightly larger bias because it tended to under-fit the data. Summarizing, although differences were small, the frequencies of the best and worst performance clearly favoured RF if a single method is applied and MA if multiple prediction models can be developed.",2017,
Approximate Message Passing Algorithms for Generalized Bilinear Inference,"Recent developments in compressive sensing (CS) combined with increasing demands for effective high-dimensional inference techniques across a variety of disciplines have motivated extensive research into algorithms exploiting various notions of parsimony, including sparsity and low-rank constraints. In this dissertation, we extend the generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) approach, originally proposed for high-dimensional generalized-linear regression in the context of CS, to handle several classes of bilinear inference problems. First, we consider a general form of noisy CS where there is uncertainty in the measurement matrix as well as in the measurements. Matrix uncertainty is motivated by practical cases in which there are imperfections or unknown calibration parameters in the signal acquisition hardware. While previous work has focused on analyzing and extending classical CS algorithms like the LASSO and Dantzig selector for this problem setting, we propose a new algorithm called Matrix Uncertain GAMP (MU-GAMP) whose goal is minimization of mean-squared error of the signal estimates in the presence of these uncertainties, without attempting to estimate the uncertain measurement matrix itself. Next, we extend GAMP to the generalized-bilinear case, in which the measurement matrix is estimated jointly with the signals of interest, enabling its application to matrix completion, robust PCA, dictionary learning, and related matrix-factorization problems. We derive this Bilinear GAMP (BiG-AMP) algorithm as an approximation of the sum-product ii belief propagation algorithm in the high-dimensional limit, where central limit theorem arguments and Taylor-series approximations apply, and under the assumption of statistically independent matrix entries with known priors. In addition, we propose an adaptive damping mechanism that aids convergence under finite problem sizes, an expectation-maximization (EM)-based method to automatically tune the parameters of the assumed priors, and two rank-selection strategies. We then discuss the specializations of EM-BiG-AMP to the problems of matrix completion, robust PCA, and dictionary learning, and present the results of an extensive empirical study comparing EM-BiG-AMP to state-of-the-art algorithms on each problem. Our numerical results, using both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrate that EM-BiG-AMP yields excellent reconstruction accuracy (often best in class) while maintaining competitive runtimes and avoiding the need to tune algorithmic parameters. Finally, we propose a parametric extension known as P-BiG-AMP, which recovers BiG-AMP as a special case, that relaxes the assumption of statistically independent matrix entries by introducing parametric models for the two matrix factors. The resulting algorithm is rigorously justified for random affine parameterizations and constructed to allow its use with an even wider class of non-linear parameterizations, enabling numerous potential applications.",2014,
"Avifauna of the Four Canyon Preserve, Ellis County, Oklahoma","In 2004 the Nature Conservancy established a new preserve in the mixed prairie of northwestern Oklahoma. Our year-round surveys of the preserve in 2005 yielded 97 bird species. With additional species recorded by others, the site list stands at 111 native species and two non-native species. We confirmed nearly one-fourth of these species as breeders on site, and an additional fourth of the species probably or possibly breed on site. Among the species we recorded on site were Interior Least Terns (Sterna antillarum athalassos), and we report on the potential occurrence of resident Lesser Prairie-Chickens (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus) and migrant Whooping Cranes (Grus americanus). We also compiled a list of additional species likely to occur on the preserve as migrants, breeders, or winter visitors.",2017,
"Factors Affecting Exclusive Breastfeeding, Using Adaptive LASSO Regression","Background
Exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) in the first six months of the life can significantly improve maternal and children health, and it is especially important in low- and middle-income countries. We aimed to determine the factors affecting EBF duration in a sample of Iranian infants.


Methods
This prospective study was conducted between April 2012 and October 2014 in Fars, Iran. Women (N=2640), who had given birth to healthy term infants were categorized into EBF versus non-EBF groups. Demographic information from mothers and infants, medical and drug history, and pregnancy related factors were compared between the two groups. Multivariable analysis was performed using Adaptive Lasso regression. P<0.05 was considered significant.


Results
The mean duration of EBF was 4.63Â±1.99 months. There was an inverse association between the mother's educational level and duration of EBF (P<0.001). Also, we found that mothers who were housewives had a significantly longer duration of EBF (4.68Â±1.97) compared to mothers with either part-time (4.21Â±2.01) or full-time jobs (4.02Â±2.12) (P<0.001). By eliminating the redundant factors, the proposed multivariable model showed the infant's weight gain during EBF, singleton/multiple pregnancies, maternal perception of quantity of breast milk, post-partum infection, use of pacifier, neonate's irritability, birth place and mother's full-time job as the most important factors affecting the duration of EBF. Twin pregnancies, post-partum infection, cesarean section by maternal request, use of a pacifier and irritability in the neonatal period significantly reduced the duration of EBF.


Conclusion
Health policy-makers should promote EBF programs among the educated as well as working mothers in order to positively affect the community's health status.",2018,International Journal of Community Based Nursing and Midwifery
Lazy snapping,"In this paper, we present Lazy Snapping, an interactive image cutout tool. Lazy Snapping separates coarse and fine scale processing, making object specification and detailed adjustment easy. Moreover, Lazy Snapping provides instant visual feedback, snapping the cutout contour to the true object boundary efficiently despite the presence of ambiguous or low contrast edges. Instant feedback is made possible by a novel image segmentation algorithm which combines graph cut with pre-computed over-segmentation. A set of intuitive user interface (UI) tools is designed and implemented to provide flexible control and editing for the users. Usability studies indicate that Lazy Snapping provides a better user experience and produces better segmentation results than the state-of-the-art interactive image cutout tool, Magnetic Lasso in Adobe Photoshop.",2004,
Regularized Gaussian Psychological Networks: Brief Report on the Performance of Extended BIC Model Selection,"In recent literature, the Gaussian Graphical model (GGM; Lauritzen, 1996), a network of partial correlation coefficients, has been used to capture potential dynamic relationships between psychological variables. The GGM can be estimated using regularization in combination with model selection using the extended Bayesian Information Criterion (Foygel and Drton, 2010). I term this methodology GeLasso, and asses its performance using a plausible psychological network structure with both continuous and ordinal datasets. Simulation results indicate that GeLasso works well as an out-of-the-box method to estimate a psychological network structure.",2016,arXiv: Methodology
Submitted to the Annals of Statistics LASSO-TYPE RECOVERY OF SPARSE REPRESENTATIONS FOR HIGH-DIMENSIONAL DATA,"UC Berkeley The Lasso [28] is an attractive technique for regularization and variable selection for high-dimensional data, where the number of predictor variables p is potentially much larger than the number of samples n. However, it was recently discovered [23, 38, 39] that the sparsity pattern of the Lasso estimator can only be asymptotically identical to the true sparsity pattern if the design matrix satisfies the so-called irrepresentable condition. The latter condition can easily be violated in applications due to the presence of highly correlated variables. Here we examine the behavior of the Lasso estimators if the irrepresentable condition is relaxed. Even though the Lasso cannot recover the correct sparsity pattern, we show that the estimator is still consistent in the `2-norm sense for fixed designs under conditions on (a) the number sn of non-zero components of the vector Î²n and (b) the minimal singular values of the design matrices that are induced by selecting of order sn variables. The results are extended to vectors Î² in weak `q-balls with 0 < q < 1.

Il Clima Dell'areale Del Lago Maggiore Durante Gli Ultimi Cinquant'anni the Climate of Lago Maggiore Area during the Last Fifty Years,"Data collected in over 50 years' activity at the C.N.R. meteorological station of Pallanza were analysed to see whether any changes have taken place in some climatic elements and to quantify the extent of such changes. A statistical analysis of the respective historical series was performed on nine meteorological parameters (solar radiation, insolation, air temperature, atmospheric pressure, humidity, cloud cover, precipitation, evaporation and wind), and on two other strictly limnological features: the level of Lago Maggiore and its water temperature at six different depths. In particular, we evaluated the means and the extremes (maxima and minima) on an annual, seasonal, monthly and daily level, with the results presented uniformly for all the parameters, also in graphic form. We especially highlighted the trend lines, even though they were not always statistically significant owing to the extreme variability of the meteorological data; in the absence of statistical validity, their significance is an approximate indication of their increasing or decreasing trend. Results showed that insolation, air temperature and atmospheric pressure had increased markedly over time, at least on an annual level, with the trends for solar radiation, humidity and cloud cover also showing an increase, though very slight. Evaporation and wind showed a steady, marked decrease, while precipitation and lake level were essentially stable. Water temperature showed a more varied picture, with the temperature of the topmost levels (to a depth of 10 m) continuing to increase. Con lo scopo di verificare eventuali mutamenti intervenuti in alcuni elementi del clima, e di quantificarne l'entita, sono stati analizzati i dati raccolti in oltre 50 anni di attivita della stazione meteorologica di Pallanza, gestita dal C.N.R. Un'analisi statistica delle rispettive serie storiche e stata condotta su nove parametri meteorologici (radiazione solare, insolazione, temperatura dell'aria, pressione atmosferica, umidita, nuvolosita, precipitazioni, evaporazione e vento) e su altri due di carattere prettamente limnologico e cioe l'andamento del livello del Lago Maggiore e la temperatura delle sue acque a sei diverse profondita. In particolare si sono valutate le medie e gli estremi (massimi e minimi) a livello annuale, stagionale, mensile e giornaliero con la presentazione dei risultati che e stata impostata in modo uniforme per tutti i parametri, anche sotto il profilo grafico. Sono state evidenziate, in particolare, le rette di tendenza anche se la loro significativita, intesa in senso strettamente statistico, non sempre e stata raggiunta per l'estrema variabilita dei dati meteorologici: in assenza di una valenza statistica il loro significato e un'indicazione di massima sul loro andamento tendenziale, in crescita o in diminuzione. In sensibile aumento nel tempo sono risultati, almeno a livello dei dati annuali, insolazione, temperatura dell'aria e pressione atmosferica, mentre una tendenza sempre in crescita, ma in misura molto modesta, sono state radiazione solare, umidita e nuvolosita. Evaporazione e vento sono invece andati progressivamente e sensibilmente diminuendo, mentre sostanzialmente stabili si sono mantenuti precipitazioni e livello del lago. Piu articolato invece il comportamento delle temperature dell'acqua con le piu superficiali (fino a 10 m di profondita) che sono state sempre in aumento. W. Ambrosetti et al. 2 INTRODUZIONE (INTRODUCTORY REMARKS) Fin dal 1951 e attiva a Pallanza, presso l'Istituto per lo Studio degli Ecosistemi (I.S.E.) del C.N.R. (gia Istituto Italiano di Idrobiologia), una stazione meteorologica la cui funzione principale e la raccolta di informazioni sullo stato dell'atmosfera a supporto dei limnologi interessati allo studio del Lago Maggiore e degli altri bacini lacustri limitrofi: e infatti ormai riconosciuta l'importanza che i fenomeni atmosferici hanno nell'influenzare i processi fisici, chimici e biologici interni alla massa d'acqua. Questa priorita non ha impedito la collaborazione nel passato con alcune reti meteorologiche nazionali quali l'U.C.E.A. (Ufficio Centrale di Ecologia Agraria) dell'allora Ministero dell'Agricoltura e Foreste, la rete nazionale del C.N.R. per il controllo della radioattivita da fallout e l'Ufficio Idrografico del Po del Ministero dei Lavori Pubblici con l'invio sistematico delle informazioni meteorologiche raccolte a Pallanza. Attualmente e in atto la collaborazione con il Servizio Meteorologico della Regione Piemonte in materia di previsione e di monitoraggio ambientale, attraverso il collegamento con la centrale operativa della loro rete delle apparecchiature operanti a Pallanza, ed anche di alcune altre stazioni meteorologiche e idrologiche gestite dall'I.S.E. E stata invece esclusa qualsiasi attivita di previsioni del tempo e, conseguentemente dell'emissione dei relativi bollettini di informazione. Per questi motivi accanto alle registrazioni di elementi del clima tradizionali si sono misurati anche altri parametri che hanno riferimento piu specifico alla caratteristiche limnologiche quali l'evaporazione, il livello del lago e la temperatura delle sue acque a sei differenti profondita. L'insieme di tutte queste informazioni raccolte in oltre cinquanta anni di attivita sono gia state presentate attraverso numerose pubblicazioni la cui ossatura principale e rappresentata dagli Annuari dell'Osservatorio Meteorologico di Pallanza (vedi bibliografia) e ad esse si dovra fare riferimento per quanto attiene all'ubicazione della stazione, alle caratteristiche tecniche specifiche della dotazione strumentale, nonche alle modalita di lettura e di elaborazione dei dati. Scopo principale di questo lavoro e pertanto di verificare se in questo lungo lasso di tempo siano intervenuti mutamenti nella struttura di alcuni parametri meteorologici e di quantificarne l'entita, senza per altro specificarne cause ed effetti. I parametri che qui saranno considerati sono: â€¢ radiazione solare â€¢ insolazione â€¢ temperatura dell'aria â€¢ pressione atmosferica â€¢ umidita â€¢ nuvolosita â€¢ precipitazioni â€¢ vento â€¢ livello del Lago Maggiore â€¢ temperatura delle acque del lago a sei diverse profondita. Le serie statistiche relative a ciascun parametro non sono state sottoposte ad alcuna integrazione dal momento che il continuo ed assiduo controllo con cui gli operatori hanno seguito il procedere delle registrazioni ha ridotto al minimo le immancabili interruzioni, immediatamente sopperite con osservazioni dirette con altre apparecchiature disponibili. Le analisi statistiche sulle serie storiche dei singoli parametri non si limiteranno alle rispettive medie annuali ma saranno accompagnate da osservazioni su quelle stagionali, mensili e giornaliere al fine di evidenziare, anche a questi livelli, le eventuali diverse risposte agli agenti esterni da parte delle componenti dell'ecosistema lacustre. Si ricorda, a questo proposito, che poiche l'anno meteorologico secondo le convenzioni internazionali, ha inizio con il primo giorno di dicembre, i periodi stagionali si articolano in modo diverso rispetto a quelli astronomici e pertanto l'inverno comprende nella loro interezza i mesi di dicembre, gennaio e febbraio, la primavera copre marzo, aprile e maggio, l'estate si estende da giugno ad agosto e, infine, l'autunno e composto dai mesi di settembre, ottobre e novembre. Oltre ai dati medi di ciascun parametro saranno analizzati anche quelli estremi (massimi e minimi), utilizzando, ove possibile, le stesse modalita di elaborazione e di rappresentazione che sono state impostate, anche sotto il profilo grafico, in maniera uniforme per tutti i parametri per cui la maggior parte delle figure presentate nel testo risultano cosi strutturate: â€¢ rappresentazione della serie storica attraverso la visualizzazione dei valori di ciascun anno, marcati ed uniti da una linea tratteggiata sottile; â€¢ rappresentazione della retta di tendenza (linea a tratteggio grosso); nella consapevolezza che la sua significativita, intesa in senso strettamente statistico, non e sempre raggiunta sopra tutto per i valori estremi (massimi e minimi) stante la estrema variabilita interannuale dei dati meteorologici. La sua interpretazione va intesa soltanto come indicazione di massima della tendenza all'aumento o alla diminuzione dei valori; â€¢ valutazione e rappresentazione sul grafico della sua equazione, al fine di consentire di quantificare, attraverso il parametro angolare, l'entita della tendenza nel corso del periodo considerato; â€¢ rappresentazione della curva ricavata dalle medie mobili (linea grossa continua), valutata con diverso periodo (da 2 a 5) in rapporto alla lunghezza della serie di dati disponibile: la sua funzione e di lisciare la distribuzione dei dati e quindi di permettere la visualizzazione della presenza di eventuali andamenti ciclici o, comunque, di fluttuazioni, piu o meno periodiche, dei fenomeni. Il clima dell'areale del Lago Maggiore 3 Altri grafici riguardano invece i regimi mensili dei particolari aspetti dei singoli elementi del clima al fine di valutare e quantificare la loro distribuzione media nel corso dell'anno e la distribuzione in classi di alcuni elementi del clima. 1.

Essays That Kill,"Killer Essays are staging a comeback. The beasts used to be virtually extinct. Few contemporaries knew them except from books. Since an cient times, literati had sung their praise. Many had sought a brush with their own Killer. Killers preyed on the best of minds only. It was a distinction to be taken on by one. The fortunes of the Killers changed at the turn of the last century. The Acad?mie Fran?aise came out against Killer Essays, denouncing them as ""de mauvais gout."" Tasteless! I will get back later to what so motivated the august French body. Matters got worse for the Killers forever thereafter. Writers bunched up with academics and publishers, and Killer Essays were the victims. The wetlands of the interior were staked out as the creativity and information network built up. This deprived Killers of their natural habitat. Wherever they roamed, Essays were likely to be sighted. In formers were on the lookout throughout the provinces of the human mind and the most remote outposts of the soul. Informers would take no chance with an Essay turning wild. In no time would they lasso any Essay remotely resembling a Killer. They would make the Essay run in circles until it was broken in. It was not poaching of Essays so much as coaching of Essays the informers engaged in. Informers tamed Essays before they would strike. Teachers kept Essays from straying and gave them no chance to out grow and overpower writers. That arrangement rendered the world of Essays a cozy one. Writers ran no risk of being attacked and eaten alive by their own Essays. Readers were sure not to be troubled by Essays, or at least not much. With all their tact and good taste, Essays became to the educated what sermons were to churchgoers. Indeed, many churchgoers turned to Essays after the Pope threw out the tradi tional liturgy. Essays became Sunday reminders that truth comes in glimpses, and only to those who keep their minds open to serious reflection. The rich ritual of Essays combined the artsy with the mind ful and made them sanctuaries from the HERE AND NOW. Writers,",1998,The Iowa Review
Bayesian sigmoid shrinkage with improper variance priors and an application to wavelet denoising,"The normal Bayesian linear model is extended by assigning a flat prior to the @dth power of the variance components of the regression coefficients 0<@d=<12 in order to improve prediction accuracy. In the case of orthonormal regressors, easy-to-compute analytic expressions are derived for the posterior distribution of the shrinkage and regression coefficients. The expected shrinkage is a sigmoid function of the squared value of the least-squares estimate divided by its standard error. This gives a small amount of shrinkage for large values and, provided @d is small, heavy shrinkage for small values. The limit behavior for both small and large values approaches that of the ideal coordinatewise shrinker in terms of the expected squared error of prediction, when @d is close to 0. In a simulation study of wavelet denoising, the proposed Bayesian shrinkage model yielded a lower mean squared error than soft thresholding (lasso), and was competitive with two recent wavelet shrinkage methods based on mixture prior distributions.",2006,Comput.

Issues in Evaluating the Significance of Archaeological Resources,"CULTURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT has become one of the most pressing archaeological problems of the 1970s. Indeed, most federal and state funding for archaeology goes into this aspect of the discipline. Michael Glassow has become deeply involved in cultural resource management in California archaeology. Here he argues for a wider evaluation of the significance of archaeological resources rather than merely determining whether they are relevant to local problems. Glassow demonstrates that these resources must now be evaluated in terms of how they are used to derive cultural information in archaeology as a whole. Glassow goes on to argue that quantitative analysis of sites may assist in the formulation of ""categories of significance"" as a basis for decisions about conservation of sites. This is a form of confrontation with archaeological data that can build on the foundation laid out by Albert Spaulding (1960) in his ""Dimensions of Archaeology"" paper. Glassow attempts some preliminary steps in this direction, using examples from California to support his arguments.",1977,American Antiquity
The Hunting in the Province of Elassona,"The aim of this research is to be examined and analysed the socio- economic characteristics of hunters of province Elassona, in the Prefecture of Larissa. The methodology that will follow will be models of linear regression with the method of least square and with models Logit for the more complete analysis of characteristics of hunters. The authentic project analyse also with descriptive statistics as X2 -Karl Pearson- of independence, X2 of good fitting and graphs, the socio- economic characteristics of hunters of province Elassona. I Have done This project as I was student in the department of Economic Science in university of Thessaly in city Volos. But I preferred to send you only the econometric part, as I consider it more important, in contrary the statistical analysis, which is more simple and trite. Front however we begin the analysis, it deserves we are reported in the A Pan-Hellenic hunting congress that was organised in Piraeus in 1932 with subjects as the determination the hunting species and not, the advisable way and time of these hunting, the effective protection of endemic prey and the prohibition of transaction during the year, as well as the organisation of local councils of hunting and the local funds of hunting. Many of the conclusions of congress propose most serious curtailments in the means of hunting, allowing only the firearm arm and prohibiting the manufacture, marketing, possession and use of each other means, as for example loops, fish-hook, plates, poisons as well as other auxiliary manufacture as the, barkers, partridges hunting as well as the hunting of partridges in water or hare with follow-up of traces in the snow. In 1939 are published the law L.1926 ""About hunting"", which in the substance incarnated the requirements and the wishes of hunting circles. Then the first efforts of protection of wild life concerned mainly the migrating species, after the migrating birds are faced with... exceptions. The time hunting as it is fixed by the article 261(as was modified by article L. 996/1971 and the article 8 L. 177/1975): 1. The hunting year begins from 1 August and expires 31 July of next year. 2. The hunting period for the preys which the hunting of them allowed, it begins: a) Of hare, from 15 September and it expires 10 January. b) The mountainous partridge from 10 September and it expires 10 March. c) Of flat partridge from 1 October and it expires the 30 November. d) For the remaining preys from 15 September and it expires 10 March, apart from the turtledoves, tree-living (eagle-fighter fig-eating) and remaining pigeon-species, as the quails, that the hunting of them begins on 20 August. Is allowed the hunting only at the duration of day and from 11 March and up to the beginning of hunting period is allowed the fighting with poisons of harmful preys, with concern and responsibility of hunting associations, as is allowed also the arrest, without arm, in the nests of this nurslings, up to their destruction . From 1950 and afterwards the environmental problems they exceed also the most ominous forecasts and acquire characteristically universality with main parameter the inequality growth between developed also developing world. The fruition of the wild animals have been checked to a large extent but have not been checked the increasing destructions of ecotypes The ecosystems that first fell victims of growth of societies were the wetlands that were connected with the event and the distribution of illnesses, the venturous ness and the animosity for the person. France possesses first prizes in Europe draining by 140.000 hectares the year. Ireland from the initial extent of 1.175.579 hectares in 1982 had only 578.350 hectares, that is to say the 49%.The USA has finally lost the 54% from her wetlands. Switzerland from 1800 up to today has destroyed finally the 85-90% wetlands while in Central and Southern America of the 1/5 of wetlands that was recognized as international importance they are threatened immediately by desiccation for agricultural and veterinary uses. Greece only the last 70-80 years has lost the 61% of wetlands certain from which they were irreplaceable for the wild birds.",2003,Econometrics
Strong Sure Screening of Ultra-high Dimensional Categorical Data,"Feature screening for ultra high dimensional feature spaces plays a critical role in the analysis of data sets whose predictors exponentially exceed the number of observations. Such data sets are becoming increasingly prevalent in areas such as bioinformatics, medical imaging, and social network analysis. Frequently, these data sets have both categorical response and categorical covariates, yet extant feature screening literature rarely considers such data types. We propose a new screening procedure rooted in the Cochran-Armitage trend test. Our method is specifically applicable for data where both the response and predictors are categorical. Under a set of reasonable conditions, we demonstrate that our screening procedure has the strong sure screening property, which extends the seminal results of Fan and Lv. A series of four simulations are used to investigate the performance of our method relative to three other screening methods. We also apply a two-stage iterative approach to a real data example by first employing our proposed method, and then further screening a subset of selected covariates using lasso, adaptive-lasso and elastic net regularization.",2018,arXiv: Methodology
HMLasso: Lasso for High Dimensional and Highly Missing Data,"Sparse regression such as Lasso has achieved great success in dealing with high dimensional data for several decades. However, there are few methods applicable to missing data, which often occurs in high dimensional data. Recently, CoCoLasso was proposed to deal with high dimensional missing data, but it still suffers from highly missing data. In this paper, we propose a novel Lasso-type regression technique for Highly Missing data, called `HMLasso'. We use the mean imputed covariance matrix, which is notorious in general due to its estimation bias for missing data. However, we effectively incorporate it into Lasso, by using a useful connection with the pairwise covariance matrix. The resulting optimization problem can be seen as a weighted modification of CoCoLasso with the missing ratios, and is quite effective for highly missing data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method that can efficiently deal with both high dimensional and highly missing data. We show that the proposed method is beneficial with regards to non-asymptotic properties of the covariance matrix. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method is highly advantageous in terms of estimation error and generalization error.",2018,ArXiv

"Climatic evolution across oceanic anoxic event 1a derived from terrestrial palynology and clay minerals (Maestrat Basin, Spain)","Studies dealing with the response of the continental biosphere to the environmental
 perturbations associated with Cretaceous oceanic anoxic events (OAEs) are comparatively
 rare. Here, a quantitative spore-pollen record combined with clay mineral data is
 presented, which covers the entire early Aptian OAE 1a interval (Forcall Formation,
 Maestrat basin, east Spain). The well-expressed OAE 1a carbon-isotope anomaly is
 paralleled by changes in the clay mineral assemblage and by a stepwise decline in the
 normalized frequency of Classopollis pollen (produced by xerophytic
 Cheirolepidiaceae) with lowest contents occurring during the positive Î´ 13 C
 shift. In contrast, Araucariacites and
 Inaperturopollenites pollen show a pronounced increase in relative
 abundance from low background values to become a significant component of the
 palynological assemblage during the Classopollis minimum. The observed
 changes in clay minerals and pollen distribution patterns are interpreted to reflect a
 major change in the composition of the hinterland vegetation of the Maestrat Basin, most
 probably due to short-lived but pronounced climatic cooling and changes in humidity.
 Temperature anomalies driven by organic carbon burial and associated CO 2 decline have been postulated for all major Mesozoic OAEs. The palynomorph record from the
 Iberian Maestrat basins indicates that the climax of this cooling episode was
 significantly delayed in comparison to the end of organic carbon-rich deposition in the
 world oceans.",2015,Geological Magazine
Predicting the Highway Costs Index with Machine Learning,"Big data is increasingly attracting the attention of economists. New machine learning techniques can help to analyze unconventional data structures with a large number of variables relative to the number of observations. This new venue of research o ers unique opportunities for analyzing previously untouched elds due to data limitations. Our study introduces a machine learning approach for modeling and forecasting highway construction cost changes. Our Lasso and Random Forest models have high predictive power, and it suggests that the application of machine learning techniques can improve the estimation of actual project costs for optimal allocation of public funds.",2018,
Predicting with Proxies,"Predictive analytics is increasingly used to guide decision-making in many applications. However, in practice, we often have limited data on the true predictive task of interest, but copious data on a closely-related proxy predictive task. Practitioners often train predictive models on proxies since it achieves more accurate predictions. For example, e-commerce platforms use abundant customer click data (proxy) to make product recommendations rather than the relatively sparse customer purchase data (true outcome of interest); alternatively, hospitals often rely on medical risk scores trained on a different patient population (proxy) rather than their own patient population (true cohort of interest) to assign interventions. However, not accounting for the bias in the proxy can lead to sub-optimal decisions. Using real datasets, we find that this bias can often be captured by a sparse function of the features. Thus, we propose a novel two-step estimator that uses techniques from high-dimensional statistics to efficiently combine a large amount of proxy data and a small amount of true data. We prove upper bounds on the error of our proposed estimator and lower bounds on several heuristics commonly used by data scientists; in particular, our proposed estimator can achieve the same accuracy with exponentially less true data (in the number of features $d$). Our proof relies on a new tail inequality on the convergence of LASSO for approximately sparse vectors. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on e-commerce and healthcare datasets; in both cases, we achieve significantly better predictive accuracy as well as managerial insights into the nature of the bias in the proxy data.",2018,ArXiv
Statistical methods in neuroimaging genetics : pathways sparse regression and cluster size inference,"In the field of neuroimaging genetics, brain images are used as phenotypes in the search for genetic variants associated with brain structure or function. This search presents a formidable statistical challenge, not least because of the very high dimensionality of genotype and phenotype data produced by modern SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) arrays and high resolution MRI. This thesis focuses on the use of multivariate sparse regression models such as the group lasso and sparse group lasso for the identification of gene pathways associated with both univariate and multivariate quantitative traits. The methods described here take particular account of various factors specific to pathways genome-wide association studies including widespread correlation (linkage disequilibrium) between genetic predictors, and the fact that many variants overlap multiple pathways. A resampling strategy that exploits finite sample variability is employed to provide robust rankings for pathways, SNPs and genes. Comprehensive simulation studies are presented comparing one proposed method, pathways group lasso with adaptive weights, to a popular alternative. This method is extended to the case of a multivariate phenotype, and the resulting pathways sparse reduced-rank regression model and algorithm is applied to a study identifying gene pathways associated with structural change in the brain characteristic of Alzheimerâ€™s disease. The original model is also adapted for the task of â€™pathwaysdrivenâ€™ SNP and gene selection, and this latter model, pathways sparse group lasso with adaptive weights, is applied in a search for SNPs and genes associated with elevated lipid levels in two separate cohorts of Asian adults. Finally, in a separate section an existing method for the identification of spatially extended clusters of image voxels with heightened activation is evaluated in an imaging genetic context. This method, known as cluster size inference, rests on a number of assumptions. Using real imaging and SNP data, false positive rates are found to be poorly controlled outside of a narrow range of parameters related to image smoothness and activation thresholds for cluster formation.",2013,
Selected P. falciparum specific immune responses are maintained in AIDS adults in Burkina Faso,"SUMMARY In tropical areas wherePlasmodium falciparum malaria is endemic, co-infection with HIV-1 does not lead to a worsening of malaria, raising questions about the immunological interactions between both infections. Alterations of immune response to malaria during HIV-1 infection was investigated in the town of Bobo Dioulasso, Burkina Faso. Sixty-six adults were enrolled, including 37 HIV-1 positive subjects with 250 CD4 cells/ l and clinical AIDS, and 29 HIV-1 negative healthy subjects.In vitro lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine (IFN- , IL-2 and IL-4) production were assessed in isolated mononuclear cells (PBMC) in presence of PHA, PPD or three malarial antigens: the baculovirusexpressed protein from P. falciparum Merozoite Surface Protein-1, a P. falciparum in vitro culture and a crude schizont extract. Compared with healthy subjects, AIDS patients presented with decreased levels of cell proliferation and of IFN- and IL-2 production, in response to all antigens except the schizont extract. Similar levels of IL-4 production were obtained in both groups. Mitogenic stimulation of whole blood cultures was also performed, and revealed similar trends in cytokine production as in PBMC cultures. These results show that some components of the specific human immune responses to falciparum parasites may not be modified during AIDS, in spite of the strong cellular alterations induced by HIV, namely the decrease of the CD4 lymphocyte subset.",1996,
Lassoing and Corralling Rooted Phylogenetic Trees,"The construction of a dendogram on a set of individuals is a key component of a genomewide association study. However, even with modern sequencing technologies the distances on the individuals required for the construction of such a structure may not always be reliable making it tempting to exclude them from an analysis. This, in turn, results in an input set for dendogram construction that consists of only partial distance information, which raises the following fundamental question. For what (proper) subsets of a dendogramâ€™s leaf set can we uniquely reconstruct the dendogram from the distances that it induces on the elements of such a subset? By formalizing a dendogram in terms of an edge-weighted, rooted, phylogenetic tree on a pre-given finite set X with |X|â‰¥3 whose edge-weighting is equidistant and subsets Y of X for which the distances between every pair of elements in Y is known in terms of sets of 2-subsets of X, we investigate this problem from the perspective of when such a tree is lassoed, that is, uniquely determined by the elements in . For this, we consider four different formalizations of the idea of â€œuniquely determiningâ€ giving rise to four distinct types of lassos. We present characterizations for all of them in terms of the child-edge graphs of the interior vertices of such a tree. Our characterizations imply in particular that in case the tree in question is binary, then all four types of lasso must coincide.",2013,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology
Bayesowl: a probabilistic framework for uncertainty in semantic web,"To address the difficult but important problem of modeling uncertainty in semantic web, this research takes a probabilistic approach and develops a theoretical framework, named BayesOWL, that incorporates the Bayesian network (BN), a widely used graphic model for probabilistic interdependency, into the web ontology language OWL. This framework consists of three key components: (1)Â a representation of probabilistic constraints as OWL statements; (2)Â a set of structural translation rules and procedures that converts an OWL taxonomy ontology into a BN directed acyclic graph (DAG); and (3)Â a method SD-IPFP based on ""iterative proportional fitting procedure"" (IPFP) that incorporates available probability constraints into the conditional probability tables (CPTs) of the translated BN. The translated BN, which preserves the semantics of the original ontology and is consistent with all the given probability constraints, can support ontology reasoning, both within and cross ontologies, as Bayesian inferences, with more accurate and more plausible results. 
SD-IPFP was further developed into D-IPFP, a general approach for modifying BNs with probabilistic constraints that goes beyond BayesOWL. To empirically validate this theoretical work, both BayesOWL and variations of IPFP have been implemented and tested with example ontologies and probabilistic constraints. The tests confirmed theoretical analysis. 
The major advantages of BayesOWL over existing methods are: (1)Â it is non-intrusive and flexible, neither OWL nor ontologies defined in OWL need to be modified and one can translate either the entire ontology or part of it into BN depending on the needs; (2)Â it separates the ""rdfs:subClassOf"" relations (or the subsumption hierarchy) from other logical relations by using L-Nodes, which makes CPTs of the translated BN smaller and easier to construct in a systematic and disciplined way, especially in a domain with rich logical relations; (3)Â it does not require availability of complete conditional probability distributions, pieces of probability information can be incorporated into the translated BN in a consistent fashion. One thing to emphasize is that BayesOWL can be easily extended to handle other ontology representation formalisms (syntax is not important, semantic matters), if not using OWL.",2005,

Predictive modelling of surface roughness in fused deposition modelling using data fusion,"To realise high quality, additively manufactured parts, real-time process monitoring and advanced predictive modelling tools are crucial for accelerating quality assurance in additive manufacturing. While previous research has demonstrated the effectiveness of physics- and model-based diagnosis and prognosis for additive manufacturing, very little research has been reported on real-time monitoring and predictive modelling of the surface roughness of additively manufactured parts. This paper presents a data fusion approach to predicting surface roughness in fused deposition modelling (FDM) processes. The predictive models are trained using random forests (RFs), support vector regression (SVR), ridge regression (RR), and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). A real-time monitoring system is developed to monitor the health condition of a FDM machine in real-time using multiple sensors. RFs, SVR, RR, and LASSO are demonstrated on the condition monitoring data collected from these sensors. To integrate the data sources, a feature-level data fusion method is introduced. Experimental results have shown that the predictive models trained by the machine learning algorithms are capable of predicting the surface roughness of additively manufacturing parts with very high accuracy. The prediction accuracy can be further improved using the data fusion method.",2019,International Journal of Production Research
Srâ€“Nd isotopic analysis of glass from Sagalassos (SW Turkey),"Abstract The Nd isotopic composition of an ancient glass is typical of the (heavy) non-quartz fraction in the silica raw material. The Sr isotopic composition is considered typical for the lime component in the raw material. In the case of natron glass, this is mostly attributed to shell or limestone in the silica sand. In this study, 1st to 5th and 6th to 7th century AD glass from Sagalassos is compared to the typical signature of 4th to 8th century AD primary glass with a known production location in Egypt and Syro-Palestine. The results suggest a difference in glass supply to Sagalassos between both periods, and that glass was produced in the eastern and western Mediterranean area at least before the 6th century AD.",2008,
Evaluation of pulp and paper making characteristics of elephant grass ( Pennisetum purpureum Schum) and switchgrass ( Panicum virgatum L.),"Shortage of conventional raw material for the pulp and paper products together with the increasing world demand for paper has renewed interest in non-wood fibres. Non-wood pulping capacity has been increasing steadily over the last decade. A lot of crops grown for biomass, like switchgrass ( Panicum virgatum L.), are good examples of plants with potential for pulp production. Raw material chemical composition, kraft pulp yield and properties, and fibre characteristics of elephant grass or hybrid pennisetum ( Pennisetum purpureum Schum. cv. SDPN3) and switchgrass (cv. Cave-in-Rock) were determined in an effort to evaluate them as raw materials for pulp and paper production. Elephant grass had Î±-cellulose and Klasson lignin contents of 45.6 and 17.7%, respectively. The respective values for switchgrass were 41.2 and 23.89 %. Pulp yields, following a mild kraft process, were 48 and 50% for switchgrass and elephant grass, respectively. The corresponding kappa numbers were 15.5 and 9.2. The weight-weighted fibre length averaged 1.32 mm. Pulp freeness was higher for switchgrass (330 mL) than for elephant grass (139 mL). Elephant grass had a burst index above 5.85 kP.m 2 g -1 . These characteristics demonstrate the suitability of both elephant grass and switchgrass for pulp production.

On the validity of the pairs bootstrap for lasso estimators,"We study the validity of the pairs bootstrap for lasso estimators in linear regression models with random covariates and heteroscedastic error terms. We show that the naive pairs bootstrap does not provide a valid method for approximating the distribution of the lasso estimator. To overcome this deficiency, we introduce a modified pairs bootstrap procedure and prove its consistency. Finally, we consider the adaptive lasso and show that the modified pairs bootstrap consistently estimates the distribution of the adaptive lasso estimator.",2015,Biometrika
Reduced Numbers and Proapoptotic Features of Mucosal-associated Invariant T Cells as a Characteristic Finding in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"To the Editor: I was interested to the read the striking observations in the report by Hiejima et al of reduced frequencies of TCR Va7.2+ CD161+ mucosalassociated invariant T (MAIT) cells in inflammatory bowel disease, occurring in both peripheral blood and mucosal tissue. Such a deficiency is likely to be functionally important as MAIT cells are abundant within the lamina propria in man and, given, they share a common antigen specificity for microbial-derived precursors of riboflavin synthesis, they are likely to constitute a critical component in mucosal host defense and the early induction of adaptive immune responses. These findings are consonant with our recent description of a similar, marked deficiency of MAIT cells in human asthma. Using the same methodology, we observed a highly significant deficiency of live CD3+ TCR Va7.2+ CD161+ T cells in peripheral blood (P 1â„4 0.005), in luminal (sputum) samples (P 1â„4 0.002), and mucosal (endobronchial biopsy) samples (P 1â„4 0.02) in asthma. This deficiency correlated with disease severity, being significant only in moderate asthma groupâ€”receiving treatment with chronic low-dose corticosteroidsâ€” and in severe asthma group, who were receiving high-dose inhaled corticosteroids and/or oral corticosteroids. We suspected these deficiencies might be attributable to therapeutic corticosteroids, indeed MAIT cell frequencies correlated negatively with dose of inhaled corticosteroids in both peripheral blood (rs 1â„4 20.59, P , 0.0001) and in sputum (rs 1â„4 20.42, P 1â„4 0.004). Therefore, we undertook 2 open-label clinical trials of inhaled and of oral corticosteroids. Peripheral blood MAIT cell frequencies were not significantly affected by 7 days of low-dose inhaled corticosteroids (equivalent to 400 mg/d of beclometasone diproprionate) but there was a significant 23% reduction in blood MAIT cell frequencies with only 7 daysâ€™ treatment with 20 mg/d oral prednisolone (P 1â„4 0.03). This effect was specific to MAIT cells as it was not observed with the Va7.2+ CD1612 population. Although Hiejima et al do not provide detailed clinical information on concomitant medications in their report, it is highly likely that many of these patients will have had current or recent exposure to topical or systemic corticosteroids, constituting the most likely explanation for their observations. It remains to be seen whether the consequences of such iatrogenic impairment of MAIT cell frequencies are beneficial or detrimental to the integrity of the gastrointestinal mucosal immune system.",2015,Inflammatory bowel diseases
[Studies on herpesvirus cuniculi. I. Virus isolation and antibody response in rabbits with experimental infection (author's transl)].,"Experimental infection of herpesvirus cuniculi (HCV or Virus III) was studied as a model of latent infection of herpes group virus.The growth of HCV in rabbit kidney (RK) cell cultures was rather slow when the cells were infected at a multiplicity of approximately 10. Infective virus appeared 30 hours after infection, and a maximum titer of 106 TCID50/0.2ml reached on the 4th day. The infectivity titer of cellassociated virus was 2 log TCID50 higher than that of fluid virus.When HCV was inoculated intracutaneously or intravenously into a rabbit, it began to be detected from peripheral leukocytes on the 7th day after infection. It was isolated constantly from leukocytes over a period of at least 14 months. Concurrently, neutralizing and complement-fixing antibodies were demonstrated in the serum.To detect infective virus, leukocytes were cultivated with RK cells. The number of leukocytes needed for positive virus isolation ranged from 800 to 100, 000, depending on the species of animals and/or the time of bleeding. No virus could be recovered from fresh leukocytes which had been disrupted by freezing and thawing before inoculated onto RK cells. It was recovered, however, when RK cells were inoculated with leukocytes which had been incubated in vitro at 37Â°C for two days prior to the occurrence of disruption by freezing and thawing. These results suggest that the virus may have existed in an inactive from in fresh leukocytes, that it may have been converted in to an infective form in these leukocytes when cultivated in vitro, and that it may have multiplied most efficiently in RK cells.Virus was also recovered from leukocytes obtained from various organs, such as brain, lung, spleen, kidney, liver, and uterus, of rabbits which were infected with the virus 4, 6 or 14 months before and cultivated with RK cells.In order to demonstrate that a rabbit was infected with HCV, it was a most sensitive method to isolate the virus from peripheral leukocytes cultivated with RK cells. The demonstration of neutralizing and/or complement-fixing antibodies was also useful for the same purpose. Serological surveillance of 101 rabbits obtained in the Tokyo area failed to show the production of any specific antibody against HCV.",1976,Uirusu
Tossing Coins Under Monotonicity,"This paper considers the following problem: we are given n coin tosses of coins with monotone increasing probability of getting heads (success). We study the performance of the monotone constrained likelihood estimate, which is equivalent to the estimate produced by isotonic regression. We derive adaptive and non-adaptive bounds on the performance of the isotonic estimate, i.e., we demonstrate that for some probability vectors the isotonic estimate converges much faster than in general. As an application of this framework we propose a two step procedure for the binary monotone single index model, which consists of running LASSO and consequently running an isotonic regression. We provide thorough numerical studies in support of our claims.",2019,
"Laimosemion paryagi (Cyprinodontiformes: Aplocheiloidei: Rivulidae), a new species from the upper Mazaruni river drainage of Western Guyana","Laimosemion paryagi, new species, is described from the upper Mazaruni river system, a tributary of the Essequibo River. It is a member of the Laimosemion breviceps group former known as the Rivulus breviceps group, and shares a robust body and deep caudal peduncle with Laimosemion breviceps (Eigenmann, 1909) and Laimosemion lyricauda (Thomerson et al., 1991) and to a lesser degree with L. gransabanae (Lasso et al., 1992) and Laimosemion torrenti- cola (Vermeulen & Isbrucker, 2000). These species are all endemic to the Guiana Highlands in western Guyana and the neighbouring Gran Sabana in Eastern Venezuela. It is distinguished from other species in the L. breviceps group by morphology and its remarkable male color pattern of red blotches on a turquoise ground color on the flanks and in the unpaired fins and having a rounded caudal fin as opposed to one having extension or being spade shaped. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA sequence reveals that it is genetically distinct from all other members of this group and that inhabitants of the Guyana highlands diverged from each other early in the history of the genus, com- mensurate with the geological age of the Guiana Shield.",2012,

Automatic Model Selection in Archetype Analysis,"Archetype analysis involves the identification of representative objects from amongst a set of multivariate data such that the data can be expressed as a convex combination of these representative objects. Existing methods for archetype analysis assume a fixed number of archetypes a priori. Multiple runs of these methods for different choices of archetypes are required for model selection. Not only is this computationally infeasible for larger datasets, in heavy-noise settings model selection becomes cumbersome. In this paper, we present a novel extension to these existing methods with the specific focus of relaxing the need to provide a fixed number of archetypes beforehand. Our fast iterative optimization algorithm is devised to automatically select the right model using BIC scores and can easily be scaled to noisy, large datasets. These benefits are achieved by introducing a Group-Lasso component popular for sparse linear regression. The usefulness of the approach is demonstrated through simulations and on a real world application of document analysis for identifying topics.",2012,
Knot selection of estimating the term structure with cubit spline function based on LAD-Lasso criterion,LAD-Lasso method was employed to estimate the Shanghai stock exchange term structure of interest rates with cubic spline function based on least absolute deviations (LAD) criterion. The forecasting power of the LAD-Lasso method based on LAD criterion was compared with the traditional knot settings. The out-of-sample forecasting results show that the model based on the new method improves the pricing precision of the bonds.,2009,Journal of University of Science and Technology of China
"A Public-Private Partnership, Year Two: South Pointe Elementary School.","South Pointe Elementary School in Miami, Florida, was the first public-private educational partnership in the United States. It opened in September 1991 as a collaboration between Education Alternatives (EAI), Inc., a private for-profit educational company, and Dade County Public Schools. The 5-year contract stipulated that the school would implement EAI's Tesseract Way educational program and that EA1 would provide instructionaltsupport, including ongoing teacher training, curricula, and classoOm equipment and supplies. This document reports on outcomes of the following three reforms: (1) the degree to which the Tesseract Way program incorporated a shared school vision; (2) the success of the school's collaborative relationships; and (3) the impact of parent-education programs, outreach programs, and the empowerment of parents in school decision-making processes. Data, collected during the 1992-93 school year, were obtained through interviews with teachers and a parent-satisfaction survey. Findings indicate that there was a high degree of agreement between the operation of South Pointe Elementary and the Tesseract Way philosophy; the professional staff believed that children greatly benefitted from the program; and the Tesseract Way principles were becoming institutionalized into the daily work culture of the schools' outreach programs. The counselors and the pl:Icipal effectively provided parents with information they needed to receive social and health-related services; however, more work needed to be done to increase attendance at parent workshops. The appendix contains the parent survey and information on SouthEastern Regional vision for Education (SERVE) resources. (LMI)",1993,
Shrinkage Estimation of Regression Models with Multiple Structural Changes,In this paper we consider the problem of determining the number of structural changes in multiple linear regression models via group fused Lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator ). We show that with probability tending to one our method can correctly determine the unknown number of breaks and the estimated break dates are sufficiently close to the true break dates. We obtain estimates of the regression coefficients via post Lasso and establish the asymptotic distributions of the estimates of both break ratios and regression coefficients. We also propose and validate a datadriven method to determine the tuning parameter. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the proposed method works well in finite samples. We illustrate the use of our method with a predictive regression of the equity premium on fundamental information.,2016,Econometric Theory
Isolation of the superior vena cava to block unidirectional exit conduction from the right-sided pulmonary veins during atrial fibrillation ablation,"Unidirectional block is rare [1], but it might lead to failure of pulmonary vein isolation (PVI). During the ablation of a patient with persistent atrial fibrillation, the left-sided veins were easily isolated. Isolation of the right-sided pulmonary veins (PVs) resulted in entrance block (panel A, all electrograms recorded with GE CardioLab 6.9.5, 30and 500-Hz filters, 5000 gain, displayed at 200 mm/s; a SmartTouch ablation and a Lasso 2515 Nav eco variable loop diagnostic catheter with 2-6-2-mm spacing were used, Biosense Webster). High output pacing (12 mV/ 2 ms, >10 g contact) via the ablation catheter roving it around distally to the ablation line revealed conduction to the left atrium (LA, panel B), and far field right atrial (RA) capture could be excluded (panel C). Further ablation proximal to line at the high anterior-superior segment (where capture was demonstrated) failed to block conduction. Next, the superior vena cava (SVC) was isolated (panels D and E, 43 Â°C and 30-W limit, 10â€“15-s applications), which resulted in loss of exit conduction from the right sided PVs (panel F). We hypothesize that we were either able to reach the epicardial surface of the right superior pulmonary vein (RSPV) or ablate an epicardial PV-RA/LA pathway [2]. The close anatomical relationship of the RSPV to the SVC (6.4-mm endo-endocardial distance in this case on the 3D electroanatomical maps) might support that. Unidirectional conduction from the PVs can be easily identified by a simple pacing maneuver when validating PVI. Isolation of SVC might help achieve bidirectional block in the right superior pulmonary vein in selected cases.",2017,Journal of Interventional Cardiac Electrophysiology
A disease annotation study of gene signatures in a breast cancer microarray dataset,"Breast cancer is a complex disease with heterogeneity between patients regarding prognosis and treatment response. Recent progress in advanced molecular biology techniques and the development of efficient methods for database mining lead to the discovery of promising novel biomarkers for prognosis and prediction of breast cancer. In this paper, we applied three computational algorithms (RFE-LNW, Lasso and FSMLP) to one microarray dataset for breast cancer and compared the obtained gene signatures with a recently described disease-agnostic tool, the Genotator. We identified a panel of 152 genes as a potential prognostic signature and the ERRFI1 gene as possible biomarker of breast cancer disease.",2011,2011 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society
Surprising dependency for retinoblastoma protein in ras-mediated tumorigenesis.,"Deregulation of the G1 cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-retinoblastoma protein (Rb) pathway is well established in virtually all human cancers. Different cancers exhibit selective alterations of the pathway, whether by inactivation of the CDK inhibitor p16Ink4a, by overexpression of the cyclin D1 gene, or by direct mutational inactivation of the Rb gene. The p16Ink-4a-CDK-Rb pathway is often considered to be a linear pathway, with mutation of one component abrogating the need to mutate another. Still, it is unclear why different paths to cancer preferentially select for mutations in one component over another. A paper in this issue of Molecular Cellular Biology by Williams, Classon, and colleagues reveals a surprising requirement for Rb in proliferation and transformation mediated by the Ras oncogene (50). This study provides a rationale for why mutational activation of Ras and genetic disruption of Rb are rarely found together in human cancers. Thus, different cancers appear to select for different disruptions in the CDK-Rb pathway in part based on the spectrum of other mutations, such as in Ras, which also occur during tumorigenesis.",2006,Molecular and cellular biology
A comparison of feature selection and classification methods in DNA methylation studies using the Illumina Infinium platform,"BackgroundThe 27k Illumina Infinium Methylation Beadchip is a popular high-throughput technology that allows the methylation state of over 27,000 CpGs to be assayed. While feature selection and classification methods have been comprehensively explored in the context of gene expression data, relatively little is known as to how best to perform feature selection or classification in the context of Illumina Infinium methylation data. Given the rising importance of epigenomics in cancer and other complex genetic diseases, and in view of the upcoming epigenome wide association studies, it is critical to identify the statistical methods that offer improved inference in this novel context.ResultsUsing a total of 7 large Illumina Infinium 27k Methylation data sets, encompassing over 1,000 samples from a wide range of tissues, we here provide an evaluation of popular feature selection, dimensional reduction and classification methods on DNA methylation data. Specifically, we evaluate the effects of variance filtering, supervised principal components (SPCA) and the choice of DNA methylation quantification measure on downstream statistical inference. We show that for relatively large sample sizes feature selection using test statistics is similar for M and Î²-values, but that in the limit of small sample sizes, M-values allow more reliable identification of true positives. We also show that the effect of variance filtering on feature selection is study-specific and dependent on the phenotype of interest and tissue type profiled. Specifically, we find that variance filtering improves the detection of true positives in studies with large effect sizes, but that it may lead to worse performance in studies with smaller yet significant effect sizes. In contrast, supervised principal components improves the statistical power, especially in studies with small effect sizes. We also demonstrate that classification using the Elastic Net and Support Vector Machine (SVM) clearly outperforms competing methods like LASSO and SPCA. Finally, in unsupervised modelling of cancer diagnosis, we find that non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) clearly outperforms principal components analysis.ConclusionsOur results highlight the importance of tailoring the feature selection and classification methodology to the sample size and biological context of the DNA methylation study. The Elastic Net emerges as a powerful classification algorithm for large-scale DNA methylation studies, while NMF does well in the unsupervised context. The insights presented here will be useful to any study embarking on large-scale DNA methylation profiling using Illumina Infinium beadarrays.",2011,BMC Bioinformatics
Diagnostik des benignen Prostatasyndroms,"ZusammenfassungDie Diagnostik der LUTS (â€žlower urinary tract symptomsâ€œ) wird in den deutschen Leitlinien unterteilt in obligatorische und fakultative diagnostische Parameter. Bei den obligatorischen Parametern sind die Anamnese, die klinische Untersuchung, der â€žInternational Prostate Symptom Scoreâ€œ (IPSS), der PSA-Wert (prostataspezifisches Antigen), die Urinanalyse, die Uroflowmetrie und die Sonographie des oberen und unteren Harntrakts. Bei den fakultativen Untersuchungen sind die Druck-Fluss-Studien, das Miktionsprotokoll und die Detrusordickenmessung zu nennen. Gerade die zuletzt genannte Methode kann mit einer hohen positiven Vorhersage eine Blasenauslassobstruktion nachweisen. Mit der MÃ¶glichkeit einer differenzierten und risikoadaptierten AbklÃ¤rung kann eine stadiengerechte Therapie durchgefÃ¼hrt werden.AbstractThe diagnostic work-up of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in the German guidelines consists of obligatory and optional diagnostic parameters. Recommendations for assessing LUTS include patient history, symptom questionnaires (IPSS international prostate symptoms score), physical examination, urine analysis, prostate-specific antigen, uroflowmetry, ultrasound examination of the urinary bladder, including postvoid residual urine and ultrasound examination of the upper urinary tract. Optional tests are voiding diary, pressure-flow studies, ultrasound measurement of detrusor wall thickness, urethrocystography and urethrocystoscopy. Ultrasound measurement of detrusor wall thickness in particular has a 95Â % positive predictive value in diagnosing bladder outlet obstruction. With all diagnostic parameters it is possible to treat LUTS in a risk-adapted manner.",2012,Der Urologe

Nonlinear regression modeling via the lasso-type regularization,"We consider the problem of constructing nonlinear regression models with Gaussian basis functions, using lasso regularization. Regularization with a lasso penalty is an advantageous in that it estimates some coefficients in linear regression models to be exactly zero. We propose imposing a weighted lasso penalty on a nonlinear regression model and thereby selecting the number of basis functions effectively. In order to select tuning parameters in the regularization method, we use a deviance information criterion proposed by Spiegelhalter et al. (2002), calculating the effective number of parameters by Gibbs sampling. Simulation results demonstrate that our methodology performs well in various situations.",2010,MI Preprint Series
Neutron diffraction ofÎ³-aluminium oxynitride,"Netherlands Energy Research Foundation, POB 1, 1755 ZG Petten, The Netherlands 7-Aluminium oxynitride (Alon) is a ceramic mater- ial which can be sintered to transparency [1]. It has a spinel-type crystal structure (space group Fd3m) and its defect structure can be described with the constant anion model proposed by McCauley [2]. In this model all anion sites are completely occupied whereas the cation sites are only partly occupied. In the spinel-type crystal structure the position of the cation sites can vary according to a certain ""spinel parameter"" (or ""u-parameter""; see, for instance, Galasso [3]). Neutron diffraction was used to estab- lish the exact positions and occupation of sites in the Alon lattice for three compositionally different Alons. Reports of neutron diffraction studies on Alon of a single composition have appeared previ- ously in the literature [4, 5], but the results are inconsistent with respect to the occupation of the cation sites. Neutron diffraction experiments were performed on Alon powders with compositions corresponding to 67.5, 73 and 77.5 tool% A1203. The 73 mol% powder was produced by reacting A1203 and A1N powders for 3 h at 1750 Â°C. After reaction the resultant powder was ground with a mortar and pestle to eliminate large particles. X-ray diffraction (XRD) of the powder revealed that residual A1N was present. Because the other two powders are not stable at 1750 Â°C [6], these powders were made at the higher temperature of 1850 Â°C. When reacting the powders at this temperature a large amount of sintering occurs and side reactions contaminate the powder (mostly with A1N). For these reasons the 67.5 and 77.5 mol % A1203 powders were made in a different way. Tablets of about 10 g were reaction sintered; after sintering, the outer layer was removed and the tablets were crushed in an iron mortar and milled for 8-24 h in isopropanol with iron balls in an iron container. The iron contamination was then re- moved with HNO3 and",1993,Journal of Materials Science Letters
Submodularity in Statistics: Comparing the Success of Model Selection Methods,"We demonstrate the usefulness of submodularity in statistics as a characterization of the difficulty of the search problem of feature selection. The search problem is the ability of a procedure to identify an informative set of features as opposed to the performance of the optimal set of features. Submodularity arises naturally in this setting due to its connection to combinatorial optimization. In statistics, submodularity isolates cases in which collinearity makes the choice of model features difficult from those in which this task is routine. Researchers often report the signal-to-noise ratio to measure the difficulty of simulated data examples. A measure of submodularity should also be provided as it characterizes an independent component difficulty. Furthermore, it is closely related to other statistical assumptions used in the development of the Lasso, Dantzig selector, and sure information screening.",2015,arXiv: Statistics Theory

Transosseous Posterior Meniscal Root Reinsertion Using Knotless Anchor for Tibial Fixation.,"A technique for posterior meniscal root reinsertion is presented. With the arthroscope in the central transtendinous portal for a better view, a 5-mm transtibial tunnel is created with the aid of an anterior cruciate ligament guide open to 45Â°. A suture device, which consists of a long needle with an eyelet on its tip, is introduced through the tunnel with a suture thread inserted through the eyelet, while the meniscus is stabilized with a grasper inserted through the anterior portal. The meniscus is pierced with the device, and the suture thread is recovered with said grasper. A finger-tip pincer is inserted through the tunnel to recover the thread. The same procedure is followed to perform a second stitch. A lasso loop is made for both stitches, and the resultant tails are knotted to a knotless suture anchor, which is inserted in the anterior cortex of the tibia, 1Â cm distal to the extra-articular end of the tibial tunnel.",2017,Arthroscopy techniques
The Impact of Thyroid Hormone Therapy on the Changes in Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate in Chronic Kidney Disease Patients with Subclinical Hypothyroidism,"CONTEXT: Thyroid hormones has a significant impact on kidney disease so it is important to consider the physiologicalassociation of thyroid dysfunction in relation to chronic kidney disease.Hypothyroidism is known to be associated with reduced renal plasma flow (RPF) and low glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Also it causes decreased renal sodium reabsorption and decreased renal ability to dilute urine, resulting in hyponatremia. SETTINGS AND DESIGN Prospective study MATERIALS AND METHODS STUDYPOPULATION: 50 ultrasound defined non diabetic chronic kidney disease patients attending outpatient and inpatient department in GRH, Madurai. INCLUSIONCRITERIA : ï‚— All non diabetic chronic kidney disease patients with subclinical hypothyroidism. ï‚— Age group of 18 to 65. EXCLUSIONCRITERIA: ï‚— Hypothyroid patients already on treatment ï‚· Diabetic patients ï‚· Patients on concurrent treatment with lithium, amiodarone or iodine PERIODOFSTUDY: 6 Months STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Categorical data expressed in percentage and percentile. Continuous data, mean, standard deviation calculated by ANOVA test. RESULTS: In this study total participants 50,in this 60% are males remaining 40% are females. Most of the person fall in 40 to 50 years of age.The mean value of TSH at baseline, end of third and sixth month respectively 7.28, 6.47 and 6.06, with significant P value of <0.001. The mean value of urea at baseline, end of third and sixth month respectively 74.72, 67.34 and 62.20, withsignificant P value of <0.001. The mean value of creatinine at baseline, end of third and sixth month respectively 2.33, 2.03 and 1.92, with significant P value of <0.001.The mean value of eGFR at baseline, end of third and sixth month respectively 32.16 , 37.97 and 40.21, with significant P value of <0.001 CONCLUSIONS: Thyroid hormone replacement for subclinical hypothyroidism may improve estimated glomerular filtration rate in chronic kidney disease patients. Thyroid hormone therapy may preserve renal function better in chronic kidney disease patients with subclinical hypothyroidism.",2019,
Prediction error after model search,"Estimation of the prediction error of a linear estimation rule is difficult if the data analyst also use data to select a set of variables and construct the estimation rule using only the selected variables. In this work, we propose an asymptotically unbiased estimator for the prediction error after model search. Under some additional mild assumptions, we show that our estimator converges to the true prediction error in $L^2$ at the rate of $O(n^{-1/2})$, with $n$ being the number of data points. Our estimator applies to general selection procedures, not requiring analytical forms for the selection. The number of variables to select from can grow as an exponential factor of $n$, allowing applications in high-dimensional data. It also allows model misspecifications, not requiring linear underlying models. One application of our method is that it provides an estimator for the degrees of freedom for many discontinuous estimation rules like best subset selection or relaxed Lasso. Connection to Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimator is discussed. We consider in-sample prediction errors in this work, with some extension to out-of-sample errors in low dimensional, linear models. Examples such as best subset selection and relaxed Lasso are considered in simulations, where our estimator outperforms both $C_p$ and cross validation in various settings.",2016,arXiv: Statistics Theory

A Novel Biomarker Based on miRNA to Predict the Prognosis of Muscle-Invasive Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma,"Muscle-invasive bladder urothelial carcinoma (MIBC) is characteristic of high mortality and high recurrence. Distinguishing the prognostic risk of MIBC at the molecular level of miRNA expression is rarely performed and thus of great significance for the management and treatment of MIBC in clinics. Adaptive lasso Cox's proportional hazards model was used to explore the relationship between differential expression miRNAs (DEmiRNAs) and MIBC survival. Furthermore, we evaluated the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) score and immune infiltration abundance by exploring EMT signature genes and TIMER database, respectively. A total of 8 DEmiRNAs were detected to be associated with the survival rate of MIBC by using the lasso Cox algorithm. Through the linear combination of these 8 DEmiRNAs, we constructed a calculated marker, which could be used to distinguish the prognosis risk in both TCGA dataset (HRâ€‰=â€‰2.03, 95% CIâ€‰=â€‰(1.47, 2.83)) and independent validation dataset (HRâ€‰=â€‰7.74, 95% CIâ€‰=â€‰(1.05, 56.93)). Meanwhile, the constructed marker had reasonably high predictive values of the AUC (area under the curve) in the TCGA dataset and validation dataset being 0.73 and 0.63, respectively. In addition, we observed that the expression values of let-7c, miR-100, and miR-145 were associated with EMT score and the abundance of macrophage in tumor tissue as well. This newly identified risk score signature based on the combination of 8 miRNAs could significantly predict the prognostic risk of MIBC and might provide insight into immunotherapy and targeted therapy of MIBC.",2019,Journal of Oncology

LATE-BREAKING ABSTRACT: Predicting asthma at age 8; the application of machine learning,"Background: Asthma is among the most common chronic conditions in childhood. We aimed to develop and validate a simple and robust model to predict asthma at 8 years of age. Methods: The data come from 3 UK cohorts in the STELAR consortium. We studied 1,145 children from Ashford and Aberdeen and externally validated the predictive model using data on 348 children from Manchester. Information on characteristics of the children, family related factors and asthma-like symptoms were collected at recruitment and at 1 and 2 or 3 years of age. We defined asthma at age 8 by the presence of at least two of the following: (1) current wheeze; (2) asthma treatment; (3) a doctor9s diagnosis of asthma. We developed a predictive model using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator method (LASSO) and assessed predictive performance by discrimination and calibration measures. Results: Current asthma was present in 117 (22.5%), 119 (21%) and 80 (21.5%) children living in Ashford, Aberdeen and Manchester, respectively.The final model included 20 predictors such as gender, maternal history of hay-fever or eczema, parental history of asthma, older sibling(s), domestic crowding; a doctor9s diagnosis of eczema, current wheeze and antibiotic use, each before the age of 3. Predictive accuracy in the external validation was 0.83, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.65 and positive and negative predictive values were 0.81 and 0.83. Conclusion: After validation, our LASSO model demonstrated good discrimination ability for asthma; its predictive performance compares favorably with that from previous tools, such as the API and PIAMA, due to increased specificity and higher positive predictive value.",2016,European Respiratory Journal
Regularized Quantile Regression Averaging for probabilistic electricity price forecasting,"Quantile Regression Averaging (QRA) has sparked interest in the electricity price forecasting community after its unprecedented success in the Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2014, where the top two winning teams in the price track used variants of QRA. However, recent studies have reported the method's vulnerability to low quality predictors when the set of regressors is larger than just a few. To address this issue, we consider a regularized variant of QRA, which utilizes the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) to automatically select the relevant regressors. We evaluate the introduced technique â€“ dubbed LASSO QRA or LQRA for short â€“ using datasets from the Polish and Nordic power markets, a set of 25 point forecasts obtained for calibration windows of different lengths and 20 different values of the regularization parameter. By comparing against nearly 30 benchmarks, we provide evidence for its superior predictive performance in terms of the Kupiec test, the pinball score and the test for conditional predictive accuracy.",2019,HSC Research Reports

"Feeding Morphology, Diet, and Ecomorphological Relationships among Five Caribbean Labrids (Teleostei, Labridae)","The ecomorphological relationship between oral and pharyngeal jaw morphology and diet was investigated for five labrids: Lachnolaimus maximus, Halichoeres garnoti, H. bivittatus, H. maculipinna, and Thalassoma bifasciatum. The goals were to examine the following: (1) the relationship between diet and oral and pharyngeal jaw morphology; and (2) the influence of feeding behavior on diet. Twelve morphological measurements reflecting aspects of feeding ability were made. Interspecific differences in dentition were described. Principal components analysis (PCA) explained 96% of the variance among morphological variables with the first two PCs. Principal component 1 accounted for 92.2% of the variance, separating species by body size, whereas PC2 (3.8% of variance) separated species by oral jaw shape and degree of protrusibility. Twenty-six prey categories were identified. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) revealed that only 4.7% of the variation in diet was attributable to morphological variables, indicating a low correlation between oral and pharyngeal jaw characters and diet. However, variables that measured some aspect of performance were good predictors of diet. The proportion of hard prey consumed was correlated to the estimates of biting force for each species. Species with stronger pharyngeal jaw musculature consumed larger amounts of hard prey than those with lesser force generating ability. Feeding behaviors, classified as suction feeding, winnowing, or biting, corresponded to oral jaw morphology. Species with less protrusible jaws were found to bite their prey, and species with more protrusible jaws",1998,Copeia
"Amplitude Supported Prospects, Analysis and Predictive Models for Reducing Risk of Geological Success","Summary Direct Hydrocarbon Indicators (DHI) are commonly used for exploration prospects. Amplitudes as an independent source of information could be used as conditional probability within Bayes Theorem to assess risk of geological success. Following research is aiming to construct predictive model for estimating probability of hydrocarbons observing DHI, P(dhi|hc). In order to build such model, we used Rose & Associates DHI Interpretation and Risk Analysis Consortium database, which contains extensive descriptions of 336 drilled prospects, with known results, across various categories: Geology, Data Quality, Amplitude Characteristics and Pitfalls. Multiple Logistic Regression was used for predicting probability P(dhi|hc). Three methods were considered within the study: two data-driven models - stepwise regression and lasso shrinkage method plus the third one, a combination of data-and expertise- driven approach - stepwise regression plus manual addition of predictors to the model. All three models with key predictors are described and give similar accuracy of prediction âˆ’ 77%. Performed data analysis and calculated models reveal several insights into R&A DHI Consortium database and amplitude prospects characterisation. The best method to create such models is probably a combination of data and expertise driven approaches, while selection of most appropriate model is a question of company's strategy.",2019,
New pull-through technique using the superficial temporal artery for transbrachial carotid artery stenting.,"Carotid artery stenting (CAS) is an effective and less invasive alternative to carotid endarterectomy for internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis, but the guiding catheter is often technically difficult to introduce into the common carotid artery (CCA) in patients with concomitant atherosclerotic disease in the peripheral vessels or aorta. A new pull-through technique between the superficial temporal artery (STA) and the brachial artery was used to deliver the guiding catheter into the CCA safely and steadily. An 83-year-old male presented with repeated transient left hemiparesis caused by severe stenosis of the origin of the right ICA. He also had severe systemic atherosclerotic disease with occlusion of the bilateral femoral arteries. The innominate artery branched at an acute angle from the aorta. Therefore, catheterization of the right CCA seemed to be impossible using a conventional approach. The guidewire introduced from the right STA was lassoed by a loop snare wire and pulled out of the left brachial artery, forming the pull-through system. The guiding catheter could be introduced into the CCA from the left brachial artery over this guidewire. Subsequently, successful stent placement was performed under the distal protection. This new technique may facilitate safe and stable CAS even in patients with a severely tortuous access route due to concomitant atherosclerotic disease.",2009,Neurologia medico-chirurgica
Weighted LASSO for Sparse Recovery With Statistical Prior Support Information,"Compressive sensing is used to recover a sparse signal from linear measurements. Without any prior support information (PSI), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) is a useful method for sparse recovery. In some settings, a statistical prior about the support of the sparse signal may be provided. It is critical to optimally incorporate such statistical PSI to enhance the recovery performance. We propose a weighted LASSO algorithm to fully exploit the statistical PSI and optimize the recovery performance. In the proposed algorithm, we exploit the most general statistical PSI model, a multilevel PSI, and incorporate it into the LASSO using a weighted  $l_{1}$ norm penalty function. An optimal weight policy is proposed to minimize the asymptotic normalized squared error (aNSE). We also derive the closed-form accurate expression for the minimum aNSE and characterize the minimum number of measurements required to achieve stable recovery. Based on this, we discuss the impact of PSI quality on the aNSE performance of the proposed algorithm. Both theoretical analysis and simulations show the performance advantages of our proposed solution over various baselines.",2018,IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing
Dalla letteratura e dal web,"La rianimazione cardiopolmonare (CPR) con compressioni toraciche e ventilazione rappresenta il secondo fondamentale anello della catena della sopravvivenza per i pazienti che sono vittima di arresto cardiaco. Evidenze sperimentali su animali (e studi osservazionali sullâ€™uomo) hanno recentemente messo in discussione lâ€™efficacia delle manovre di ventilazione ai fini della sopravvivenza, in quanto lâ€™interruzione delle compressioni toraciche Ã¨ associata a unâ€™importante riduzione del flusso coronarico e cerebrale che richiede alcuni secondi per essere ripristinato alla ripresa del massaggio cardiaco successivo. Inoltre negli scenari extraospedalieri la rianimazione spesso non viene intrapresa dal soccorritore â€œlaicoâ€ anche per la riluttanza a effettuare la ventilazione bocca a bocca. Queste evidenze hanno condotto nel 2005 alle ben note modificazioni delle linee guida internazionali per il BLS, con il cambiamento del rapporto compressioni/ventilazioni (da 15:2 a 30:2) e con lâ€™indicazione a effettuare anche soltanto le compressioni toraciche per i soccorritori â€œlaiciâ€ che non se la sentono di ventilare bocca a bocca i pazienti in arresto cardiaco extraospedaliero. Pur con queste premesse, tuttavia, non era ancora ben noto quale fosse nellâ€™uomo lâ€™impatto sulla sopravvivenza di una rianimazione effettuata con le sole compressioni toraciche da parte di soccorritori occasionali nellâ€™arresto cardiaco extraospedaliero testimoniato. I ricercatori giapponesi del SOS-KANTO study group hanno voluto rispondere a questo quesito con uno studio osservazionale, prospettico, multicentrico che ha coinvolto 58 ospedali dellâ€™area di Tokyo. I risultati sono molto interessanti: su oltre 4000 pazienti studiati, un esito neurologico favorevole a 30 giorni (outcome primario) si Ã¨ verificato nel 6,2% dei pazienti rianimati con le sole compressioni toraciche versus il 3,1% dei pazienti rianimati seguendo le linee guida tradizionali (che al tempo dello studio prevedevano ancora un rapporto compressioni/ventilazioni di 15:2), p < 0,02. Nel sottogruppo dei pazienti in cui successivamente veniva riscontrato un ritmo defibrillabile, lâ€™esito neurologico favorevole era del 22% nei pazienti gestiti con sole compressioni toraciche rispetto al 10% nei pazienti trattati convenzionalmente. La prima analisi del defibrillatore automatico avveniva in media 13 minuti dopo il â€œcollassoâ€ in entrambi i gruppi. I pazienti non rianimati dai soccorritori laici e che hanno dovuto attendere lâ€™arrivo del soccorso avanzato avevano una sopravvivenza del 2,2%. Gli Autori concludono che, sulla base di questi dati, la rianimazione con sole compressioni toraciche debba essere lâ€™approccio preferito dai soccorritori â€œlaiciâ€ nei confronti di pazienti adulti in arresto cardiaco testimoniato extraospedaliero. Commento. Il lavoro ha suscitato immediato interesse. Sullo stesso numero di Lancet, Ewy firma un editoriale dal titolo â€œCardiac arrest. Guideline changes urgently neededâ€, ed elenca 8 motivazioni stringenti per cui la ventilazione non dovrebbe essere praticata nei primi minuti di un arresto cardiaco, in particolare da personale non sanitario. Lâ€™European Resuscitation Council, da parte sua, ha inserito sul proprio sito un commento al lavoro, che mette in luce come le nuove linee guida (ILCOR 2005) in parte recepiscano giÃ  questa necessitÃ  e che pertanto una revisione immediata, prima della data prevista del 2010, non sia necessaria.",2007,
Identification de biomarqueurs prÃ©dictifs de la survie et de l'effet du traitement dans un contexte de donnÃ©es de grande dimension,"Avec la revolution recente de la genomique et la medecine stratifiee, le developpement de signatures moleculaires devient de plus en plus important pour predire le pronostic (biomarqueurs pronostiques) ou lâ€™effet dâ€™un traitement (biomarqueurs predictifs) de chaque patient. Cependant, la grande quantite dâ€™information disponible rend la decouverte de faux positifs de plus en plus frequente dans la recherche biomedicale.

Design and Characterization of Topological Small RNAs.,"RNA can self-assemble into complex structures through base pairing, as well as encode information and bind with proteins to induce enzymatic activity. Furthermore, RNA can possess intrinsic enzymatic-like (ribozymatic) activity, a property that, if necessary, can be activated only upon the binding of a small molecule or another RNA (as is the case in aptazymes). As such, RNA could be of use in nanotechnology as a programmable polymer capable of self-assembling into complex topological structures. In this chapter we describe a method for designing advanced topological structures using self-circulating RNA, exemplified by three tiers of topologically manipulated self-assembling synthetic RNA systems. The first tier of topological manipulation, the RNA knot is a physically locked structure, formed by circularizing one monomer of knotted single-stranded RNA left with loose ends (an ""open"" knot). The second tier, a two interlocking ring system, is made by interlocking two circular RNA components: a circular RNA target, and an RNA lasso designed to intercalate the target before circularizing. The third tier naturally extends this system into a string of topologically locked circular RNA molecules (an RNA chain). We detail the methodology used for designing such topologically complex RNAs, including computational predictions of secondary structure, and where appropriate, RNA-RNA interactions, illustrated by examples. We then describe the experimental methods used for characterizing such structures, and provide sequences of building blocks that can be used for topological manipulation of RNA.",2015,Methods in molecular biology

Application of statistical and computational methodology to predict brainstem dosimetry for trigeminal neuralgia stereotactic radiosurgery.,"OBJECTIVES
To apply advanced statistical and computational methodology in evaluating the impact of anatomical and technical variables on normal tissue dosimetry of trigeminal neuralgia (TN) stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).


METHODS
Forty patients treated with LINAC-based TN SRS with 90 Gy maximum dose were randomly selected for the study. Parameters extracted from the treatment plans for the study included three dosimetric output variables: the maximum dose to the brainstem (BSmax), the volume of brainstem that received at least 10 Gy (V10BS), and the volume of normal brain that received at least 12 Gy (V12). We analyzed five anatomical variables: the incidence angle of the nerve with the brainstem surface (A), the nerve length (L), the nerve width as measured both axially (WA) and sagittally (WS), the distance measured along the nerve between the isocenter and the brainstem surface (D), and one technical variable: the utilized cone size (CS). Univariate correlation was calculated for each pair among all parameters. Multivariate regression models were fitted for the output parameters using the optimal input parameters selected by the Gaussian graphic model LASSO. Repeated twofold cross-validations were used to evaluate the models.


RESULTS
Median BSmax, V10BS, and V12 for the 40 patients were 35.7 Gy, 0.14 cc, and 1.28 cc, respectively. Median A, L, WA, WS, D, and CS were 43.7Â°, 8.8 mm, 2.8 mm, 2.7 mm, 4.8 mm, and 6 mm, respectively. Of the three output variables, BSmax most strongly correlated with the input variables. Specifically, it had strong, negative correlations with the input anatomical variables and a positive correlation with CS. The correlation between D and BSmax at -0.51 was the strongest correlation between single input and output parameters, followed by that between CS and V10BS at 0.45, and that between A and BSmax at -0.44. V12 was most correlated with cone size alone, rather than anatomy. LASSO identified an optimal 3-feature combination of A, D, and CS for BSmax and V10BS prediction. Using cross-validation, the multivariate regression models with the three selected features yielded stronger correlations than the correlation between the BSmax and V10BS themselves.


CONCLUSIONS
For the first time, an advanced statistical and computational methodology was applied to study the impact of anatomical and technical variables on TN SRS. The variables were found to impact brainstem doses, and reasonably strong correlation models were established using an optimized 3-feature combination including the nerve incidence angle, cone size, and isocenter-brainstem distance.",2018,Medical physics
MRI features predict p53 status in lower-grade gliomas via a machine-learning approach,"Background
P53 mutation status is a pivotal biomarker for gliomas. Here, we developed a machine-learning model to predict p53 status in lower-grade gliomas based on radiomic features extracted from conventional magnetic resonance (MR) images.


Methods
Preoperative MR images were retrospectively obtained from 272 patients with primary grade II/III gliomas. The patients were randomly allocated in a 2:1 ratio to a training (nÂ =Â 180) or validation (nÂ =Â 92) set. A total of 431 radiomic features were extracted from each patient. The lest absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method was used for feature selection and radiomic signature construction. Subsequently, a machine-learning model to predict p53 status was established using the selected features and a Support Vector Machine classifier. The predictive performance of all individual features and the model was calculated using receiver operating characteristic curves in both the training and validation sets.


Results
The p53-related radiomic signature was built using the LASSO algorithm; this procedure consisted of four first-order statistics or related wavelet features (including Maximum, Median, Minimum, and Uniformity), a shape and size-based feature (Spherical Disproportion), and ten textural features or related wavelet features (including Correlation, Run Percentage, and Sum Entropy). The prediction accuracies based on the area under the curve were 89.6% in the training set and 76.3% in the validation set, which were better than individual features.


Conclusions
These results demonstrate that MR image texture features are predictive of p53 mutation status in lower-grade gliomas. Thus, our procedure can be conveniently used to facilitate presurgical molecular pathological diagnosis.",2018,NeuroImage : Clinical
Blood Lead Levels and Associated Factors among Children in Guiyu of China: A Population-Based Study,"OBJECTIVES
Children's health problems caused by the electronic waste (e-waste) lead exposure in China remains. To assess children's blood lead levels (BLLs) in Guiyu of China and investigate risk factors of children's elevated BLLs in Guiyu.


MATERIAL AND METHODS
842 children under 11 years of age from Guiyu and Haojiang were enrolled in this population-based study during 2011-2013. Participants completed a lifestyle and residential environment questionnaire and their physical growth indices were measured, and blood samples taken. Blood samples were tested to assess BLLs. Children's BLLs between the two groups were compared and factors associated with elevated BLLs among Guiyu children were analyzed by group Lasso logistic regression model.


RESULTS
Children living in Guiyu had significant higher BLLs (7.06 Âµg/dL) than the quantity (5.89 Âµg/dL) of Haojiang children (P<0.05). Subgroup analyses of BLLs exceeding 10 Âµg/dL showed the proportion (24.80%) of high-level BLLs for Guiyu children was greater than that (12.84%) in Haojiang (P<0.05). Boys had greater BLLs than girls, irrespectively of areas (P<0.05). The number of e-waste piles or recycling workshops around the house (odds ratio, 2.28; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.37 to 3.87) significantly contributed to the elevated BLLs of children in Guiyu, and girls had less risk (odds ratio, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.31 to 0.83) of e-waste lead exposure than boys.


CONCLUSIONS
This analysis reinforces the importance of shifting e-waste recycling piles or workshops to non-populated areas as part of a comprehensive response to e-waste lead exposure control in Guiyu. To correct the problem of lead poisoning in children in Guiyu should be a long-term mission.",2014,PLoS ONE
Intracranial Pressure Forecasting in Children Using Dynamic Averaging of Time Series Data,"Increased Intracranial Pressure (ICP) is a serious and often life-threatening condition. If the increased pressure pushes on critical brain structures and blood vessels, it can lead to serious permanent problems or even death. In this study, we propose a novel regression model to forecast ICP episodes in children, 30 min in advance, by using the dynamic characteristics of continuous intracranial pressure, vitals and medications during the last two hours. The correlation between physiological parameters, including blood pressure, respiratory rate, heart rate and the ICP, is analyzed. Linear regression, Lasso regression, support vector machine and random forest algorithms are used to forecast the next 30 min of the recorded ICP. Finally, dynamic features are created based on vitals, medications and the ICP. The weak correlation between blood pressure and the ICP (0.2) is reported. The Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) of the random forest model decreased from 1.6 to 0.89% by using the given medication variables in the last two hours. The random forest regression gave an accurate model for the ICP forecast with 0.99 correlation between the forecast and experimental values.",2018,
OP0018â€…Tool and threshold predicting a successful biological dmards tapering in patients with ra remission determination,"Background Tapering trials confirmed the feasibility of TNF inhibitors (TNFi) tapering for a relevant proportion of patients in remission and/or low disease activity. However, there are no consensual predictors of a good response to therapeutic spacing among patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in remission. Objectives To determine the most predictive tool and threshold of a successful TNFi tapering. Methods Population: The Spacing of TNF-blocker injections in Rheumatoid Arthritis Study (STRASS) trial included 137 RA patients fulfilled the ACR 1987 criteria with sustained (at least 6 months) DAS28 <2.6. Patients were randomly assigned to one of the two following strategies: in the Maintain arm, patients continued to receive TNFi at the standard full regimen and in the Spacing arm, the strategy applied progressive spacing of ADA or ETN subcutaneous injections up to discontinuation at the forth step in the spacing arm. We used the data of the Spacing arm. Analysis: The performances of several variables (DAS28, SDAI, CDAI, CRP, ACPA status, HAQ, patient/physician global assessment, and booleen remission criteria) were assessed for the prediction of successful TNFi tapering, defined as reaching at least 25% tapering of the full regimen during at least 6 months, using sensitivity and specificity for dichotomous variables, or the area under the ROC curve (AUC) and its 95% confidence interval for continuous variables. A predictive score of successful tapering was constructed using LASSO regression modeling technique to avoid overfitting (R software version 3.2.1). Results The main characteristic of the 64 patients of the Spacing arm were the following (mean Â± SD): age 54.3Â±10.7 years, disease duration 8.3Â±5.4 years, and DAS 28 1.9Â±0.6. The baseline variables were similar between patients who failed or succeeded at TNFi spacing, except for the HAQ score (0.30 in the group success and 0.89 in the failure group, p=0.01) and the CRP (2.35 mg/l versus 3.48 mg/l, respectively, p=0.02). Baseline variables performance in predicting successful TNFi spacing: None of the tested variables was able to predict successful TNFi spacing, except the HAQ score and the CRP. A HAQ threshold â‰¥1.125 had a specificity (Spe) of 93% and an AUC: 0.713 (CI95%: 0.540â€“0.886). A CRP threshold â‰¥6.8 mg/l had a Spe of 0.97 and an AUC: 0.689 (CI95%: 0.547â€“0.831). Composite criteria: A composite criteria able to predict successful TNFi spacing has been elaborated, including ACPA status, Boolean criteria, SDAI, CRP and HAQ. A composite score lower than 0.502 was able to predict a successful TNFi spacing: Spe: 100%; Se: 54%; AUC: 0.829 (CI95%: 0.671 - 0.986). Conclusions The remission maintenance in rheumatoid arthritis after TNFi spacing is possible. Our results showed that in a population of RA patients in remission with TNFi, baseline HAQ and CRP are independent predictor factors of successful tapering. We have developed a composite index able to predict successful TNFi spacing, with an AUC of 0.829 and a specificity of 100%. A validation study will be needed to confirm its ability to select patients for treatment decrease. Disclosure of Interest None declared",2017,Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases
Literature-Based Genetic Risk Scores for Coronary Heart DiseaseClinical Perspective,"Backgroundâ€” Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified many single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with coronary heart disease (CHD) or CHD risk factors (RF). Using a case-cohort study within the prospective Cardiovascular Registry Maastricht (CAREMA) cohort, we tested if genetic risk scores (GRS) based on GWAS-identified SNPs are associated with and predictive for future CHD.

Methods and Resultsâ€” Incident cases (n=742), that is, participants who developed CHD during a median follow-up of 12.1 years (range, 0.0â€“16.9 years), were compared with a randomly selected subcohort of 2221 participants selected from the total cohort (n=21 148). We genotyped 179 SNPs previously associated with CHD or CHD RF in GWAS as published up to May 2, 2011. The allele-count GRS, composed of all SNPs, the 153 RF SNPs, or the 29 CHD SNPs were not associated with CHD independent of CHD RF. The weighted 29 CHD SNP GRS, with weights obtained from GWAS for every SNP, were associated with CHD independent of CHD RF (hazard ratio, 1.12 per weighted risk allele; 95% confidence interval, 1.04â€“1.21) and improved risk reclassification with 2.8% ( P =0.031). As an exploratory approach to achieve weighting, we performed least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis on all SNPs and the CHD SNPs. The CHD LASSO GRS performed equal to the weighted CHD GRS, whereas the Overall LASSO GRS performed slightly better than the weighted CHD GRS.

Conclusionsâ€” A GRS composed of CHD SNPs improves risk prediction when adjusted for the effect sizes of the SNPs. Alternatively LASSO regression analysis may be used to achieve weighting; however, validation in independent populations is required.",2012,Circulation-cardiovascular Genetics
Nephrology Quiz and Questionnaire: 2009.,"The Nephrology Quiz and Questionnaire returns to the pages of CJASN after an absence of 3 years, but it still remains one of the most popular sessions at the annual meeting of the American Society of Nephrology . The meeting in 2009 in San Diego was no exception, with a full-house attendance, estimated at more than 800 eager nephrologists. Eight challenging and educational cases were presented and discussed by four able and skilled experts. The discussants were asked to prepare vignettes of puzzling cases, each illustrating some topical, challenging, or controversial aspect of diagnosis or management of ESRD and dialysis (Dr. Bargman), fluid and electrolytes (Dr. Palmer), kidney transplantation (Dr. Samaniego), and glomerular disease (Dr. Fervenza). One or two single best answers questions followed each case presentation, which were addressed by the audience in a live electronic response system. In addition, several weeks before the meeting, the cases and questions (without the answers) were sent to all of the US nephrology training program directors as a questionnaire. Their responses to the questions were tallied and presented after the audience response but before the answers to the quiz and the analyses of the cases were given by the discussants.

Each discussant prepared a manuscript summarizing his or her discussion of the cases, an edited version of which serves as the main text of this article. We hope that this â€œdistillateâ€ from San Diego will serve the subscribers to CJASN well and provide some fresh insights into the complexity and vibrancy of clinical nephrology for those who were unable to attend (Richard J. Glassock, MD, Moderator).

Prolegomena to a Materialist Humanism,"AbstractThis article sets the agenda for a new materialist humanism through a critique and analysis of theories of materialist subjectivity in recent French philosophy. I begin with a critique of the lack of a properly internal account of the human subject in the work of Alain Badiou, arguing that his disavowal of any sort of humanism and a dismissal of the natural sciences leaves him without a way to conceptualize the internal activity of the human subject. I then consider the neurological account of human subjectivity offered in Catherine Malabou's recent materialist articulation of human consciousness and consider how this internal theory of human subjectivity can supplement the wholly external account offered by Badiou. I conclude the article with a consideration of Quentin Meillassoux's speculative materialism to show the manner in which at the ontological level he offers a materialist account of human thought as contingently emerging from wholly material processes. Building upon this, I point toward...",2014,Angelaki
A Modified Principal Component Technique Based on the LASSO,"In many multivariate statistical techniques, a set of linear functions of the original p variables is produced. One of the more difficult aspects of these techniques is the interpretation of the linear functions, as these functions usually have nonzero coefficients on all p variables. A common approach is to effectively ignore (treat as zero) any coefficients less than some threshold value, so that the function becomes simple and the interpretation becomes easier for the users. Such a procedure can be misleading. There are alternatives to principal component analysis which restrict the coefficients to a smaller number of possible values in the derivation of the linear functions, or replace the principal components by â€œprincipal variables.â€ This article introduces a new technique, borrowing an idea proposed by Tibshirani in the context of multiple regression where similar problems arise in interpreting regression equations. This approach is the so-called LASSO, the â€œleast absolute shrinkage and selection o...",2003,Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics
Terapia chirurgica dellâ€™obesitÃ : indicazioni e complicanze,"RiassuntoIl ricorso alla chirurgia come terapia dellâ€™obesitÃ  si basa sul fatto che la riduzione del peso indotta da restrizioni dietetiche associate o meno a modificazioni comportamentali o a terapia farmacologia sia gravata da unâ€™inaccettabile elevata incidenza di riguadagno del peso corporeo entro 2 anni dalla perdita di peso massimale. Il paziente obeso diventa candidato ad un trattamento chirurgico quando, dopo ripetuti tentativi dietetico-comportamentali e/o farmacologici, presenta un indice di massa corporea (IMC) Ð“40 o >35, se sono presenti co-morbiditÃ . Mentre le tecniche chirurgiche â€œmalassorbitiveâ€ vanno riservate a quei pazienti gravemente obesi in cui Ã¨ dimostrata o prevedibile unâ€™ incapacitÃ  ad adeguarsi alla riduzione degli introiti alimentari, quelle cosiddette â€œrestrittiveâ€ necessitano di una â€œcomplianceâ€ da parte del paziente, cioÃ¨ lâ€™accettazione di restrizioni dietetiche con lâ€™impegno e la disponibilitÃ  ad essere seguito periodicamente nel post-operatorio per lungo tempo. La selezione dei pazienti candidati alla chirurgia bariatrica e la scelta del tipo di intervento deve scaturire da una collaborazione e co-operazione tra competenze mediche facenti parte di un team multidisciplinare dove, oltre al chirurgo bariatra, un ruolo fondamentale spetta allâ€™endocrinologo, allo psichiatra e allo psicologo dediti allo studio dei disturbi del comportamento alimentare, allâ€™internista alimentarista con il personale di dietologia, ma anche a tutti quegli specialisti (cardiologo, pneumologo, radiologo, anestesista, etc.) coinvolti nella valutazione e trattamento delle patologie associate allâ€™obesitÃ . Nellâ€™approccio al paziente obeso, anche in presenza di un rigoroso rispetto delle indicazioni e a fronte di unâ€™ importante e significativa efficacia delle diverse procedure chirurgiche bariatriche, non vanno assolutamente sottovalutate le possibili complicanze derivanti da questo tipo di chirurgia, sia in termini di vere e proprie complicanze che di cosiddetti effetti collaterali.

Smoothly Clipped Absolute Deviation on High Dimensions,"The smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) estimator, proposed by Fan and Li, has many desirable properties, including continuity, sparsity, and unbiasedness. The SCAD estimator also has the (asymptotically) oracle property when the dimension of covariates is fixed or diverges more slowly than the sample size. In this article we study the SCAD estimator in high-dimensional settings where the dimension of covariates can be much larger than the sample size. First, we develop an efficient optimization algorithm that is fast and always converges to a local minimum. Second, we prove that the SCAD estimator still has the oracle property on high-dimensional problems. We perform numerical studies to compare the SCAD estimator with the LASSO and SISâ€“SCAD estimators in terms of prediction accuracy and variable selectivity when the true model is sparse. Through the simulation, we show that the variance estimator of Fan and Li still works well for some limited high-dimensional cases where the true nonzero coeffic...",2008,Journal of the American Statistical Association
A Constructive Approach to High-dimensional Regression,"We develop a constructive approach to estimating sparse, high-dimensional linear regression models. The approach is a computational algorithm motivated from the KKT conditions for the $\ell_0$-penalized least squares solutions. It generates a sequence of solutions iteratively, based on support detection using primal and dual information and root finding. We refer to the algorithm as SDAR for brevity. Under a sparse Rieze condition on the design matrix and certain other conditions, we show that with high probability, the $\ell_2$ estimation error of the solution sequence decays exponentially to the minimax error bound in $O(\sqrt{J}\log(R))$ steps; and under a mutual coherence condition and certain other conditions, the $\ell_{\infty}$ estimation error decays to the optimal error bound in $O(\log(R))$ steps, where $J$ is the number of important predictors, $R$ is the relative magnitude of the nonzero target coefficients. Computational complexity analysis shows that the cost of SDAR is $O(np)$ per iteration. Moreover the oracle least squares estimator can be exactly recovered with high probability at the same cost if we know the sparsity level. We also consider an adaptive version of SDAR to make it more practical in applications. Numerical comparisons with Lasso, MCP and greedy methods demonstrate that SDAR is competitive with or outperforms them in accuracy and efficiency.",2017,arXiv: Computation
Sensitivity of the Eastern Mediterranean geomorphic system towards environmental change during the Late Holocene: a chronological perspective,"Alluvial and colluvial sediment deposition provide a vital record of environmental change during the Holocene. Firm chronological control on these archives is necessary to enable us to relate sediment dynamics to human activity and climate variability. In the Eastern Mediterranean, such relationships are hard to establish due to the lack of spatially well-distributed sediment archives with good chronological control. This scarcity is problematic with respect to regional-scale reconstructions of the temporal variation of sediment dynamics. Here, we present a radiocarbon database (n Â¼ 178) of geomorphological activity collected from multiple distinct sediment archives within the territory of Sagalassos in south-western Turkey. The data were grouped according to their sedimentary facies for analysis using cumulative probability distributions (CPDs) and sedimentation rate (SR) modelling. Two small-scale colluvial valleys, where chronological information was abundant, were investigated in more detail. Results show that sedimentation chronology differs between individual, nearby cores, as it depends strongly on the local geomorphic situation. A generalizing approach combining multiple core results yields more widely valid conclusions. High sedimentation rates coincided with the initial major anthropogenic disturbance of the landscape and decreased afterwards, probably due to hillslope soil depletion. CPD and SR analysis indicates that in general colluvial sedimentation rates did not change much from 2000 BC onwards. River floodplain sedimentation, in contrast, increased markedly during the first millennium BC and during recent times, and a significant time lag in enhanced sediment deposition between the upper and lower reaches of the river valleys was observed.

A piece of my mind. Yitgadal.,"Yitgadal MS CORNWALL DIED TODAY AT 4:25 IN THE AFTERnoon. My children were by my side when I got the call. Ms Cornwallâ€™s family was by hers. Everyone knew this moment was fast approaching, yet not one of us was ready for it when it finally came to passâ€” especially not my daughter. When I put the telephone down and looked up, my eyes flooded with tears that passed from my face to hers in one smooth stream, trickling down my nose and mouth and onto her warm, soft cheeks. She bit her lower lip trying to stifle a cry, but her trembling chin gave her away. A wave of sadness swept over us as we sat curled in each otherâ€™s arms. My pain was magnified in the wake of my daughterâ€™s. How could this 10-year-old girl, who only moments earlier had argued with me in her most angry, righteous, and defensive tone, denying any sort of hostile or bullying behavior, denying how she had just attacked her brothers, now be so soft, so consumed with sorrow? We met Ms Cornwall nearly a year ago. During my first visit I learned of her many passions, including her insatiable love of the game of backgammon. Entering her room was unlike that of any other patient I had ever visited in a residential facility. It was as if the very walls were alive, beckoning me to come and listen to their stories. Every inch was adorned with collages she had crafted using colorful symbols, most of Asian influence, with old JAL calendars being her favorite source of images. The hardwood floor was covered with Oriental carpets layered atop one another precariously balancing carved chairs from the Far East. The chests along the sides of her room were also clearly from Asia and were covered with brass statues and wooden boxes, each with a story all its own waiting to be retold. In the far right corner of the room sat the ever-droning oxygen compressor with tendrils of clear tubing coiled like a lasso with one end of the â€œropeâ€ always leading to Ms Cornwall. In the far left corner stood a very tall bed with Ms Cornwall sitting with her head held high. Her sleeveless nightgown exposed her thin, wrinkly arms covered in shiny, clanky silver bangle bracelets with rings to match on most of her fingers. Only the noise of her jewelry could match the energy with which she flung herself in and out of bed as if to defy the ever-failing state of her lungs. Her backgammon board was set in mid-play on her bedside table. Because she had no one to engage with at the facility, she resorted to playing herself. She was amazed when she learned I knew the game. In a strong German accent laden with a heavy lisp, she replied, hostilely, â€œNo, you donâ€™t!â€ Her cunning mind and infectious zest for life forced an even quicker â€œProve it!â€ on the heels of her disbelief. Throwing down this gauntlet was a bigger challenge than she realized. My love runs deep for this game. My father taught it to me when I was about Isabellâ€™s age. I had not played since he died, until that day. Nearly every subsequent visit I made involved several miniâ€“backgammon tournaments. It felt wonderful to play. I had wanted to play with my kids, but the memory of my father teaching me was too haunting to allow me to take on teaching my own children. I asked Ms Cornwall if she might be willing to be their instructor. She was elated with the notion, and I set about bringing my children to meet her on their next school holiday. Many visits passed between Ms Cornwall and me before I was able to bring Joshua and Isabell. Most included rounds of backgammon. During our games we did not distract ourselves with conversation. We played. It was only in between games, as weâ€™d reset the board and she took sips of her half-regular, halfâ€“hot water Starbucks Grande coffee I routinely delivered, when Iâ€™d learn how she, a Jewish girl of 19, escaped from Germany just at the start of World War II. Oddly, this did not seem to define her as a person. She did not look upon being separated from her parents or moving to a strange country on her own with any remorse or anger. In fact, her most frequent reply to such questions on my part was â€œI am really blethssst. I have truly lived a wuunderful life!â€ With her magnetic personality radiating strong at 90, it was easy to imagine how she was able to make friends and create a community for herself in England. Even so, her competitive nature was clearly in full swing at a young age. She smiled brightly as she recalled her greatest victory soon after her move. â€œWe were playing a game, all together, and I won three eggths! Three! You have to understhand, you were lucky to have one egg a week at that time.â€ She looked like she had just won the keys to a candy store. I can only imagine how she must have appeared 70 years earlier. My children had heard about many of my patients over the years, yet they had rarely met any. Most of their encounters were with my hospitalized patients while I was rounding, but in these instances, Isabell and Joshua were always in tow, on the sidelines, never visiting by intent. They were curious and never seemed frightened by the hospital smell or the beeps of the equipment. Yet they had never been introduced to any of these people, and the stories they heard were usually around their illnesses, not about their lives. But Ms Cornwall was different. Her life was the story, a mes-",2011,JAMA
PrÃ¤ventives Risikomanagement der koronaren Herzerkrankung,"Herz-Kreislauferkrankungen zahlen zu den haufigsten Todesursachen weltweit und sind in westlichen Landern fur 45 % und in Entwicklungslandern fur 24,5 % der Gesamtmortalitat verantwortlich. Im 21. Jahrhundert werden diese Erkrankungen weiterhin das Erkrankungsspektrum und die Todesursachenstatistik anfuhren, sowohl in den Industrielandern als auch in den Entwicklungslandern. Seit 1975 sind die Mortalitatsraten fur kardiovaskulare Erkrankungen in den meisten Landern um 24 bis 28 % gesunken. Etwa 45 % dieser Reduktion sind der Verbesserung der Therapien fur KHK zuzuschreiben, die restlichen 55 % werden der Reduktion der Risikofaktoren, vor allem dem Ruckgang des Rauchens und der Behandlung der Hypertonie zugeschrieben. Es ist jedoch, besonders bei den ischamischen Herzerkrankungen, nicht klar, ob der Ruckgang der Mortalitat einen Ruckgang der Inzidenz widerspiegelt. Aufgrund der alternden Bevolkerung und der Reduktion in der altersspezifischen Mortalitat ist ein Anstieg in der absoluten Anzahl der Personen mit Herzkreislauferkrankungen anzunehmen. Auserdem konnte es durch die Zunahme der Pravalenz der Adipositas, des Metabolischen Syndroms und des Typ-II-Diabetes, wie auch durch die hohere Pravalenz der Raucherinnen im Vergleich mit der vor dreisig Jahren, in den nachsten Jahren und Jahrezehnten wieder zu einem Anstieg der Mortalitat kommen. Der Entwicklung von Herz-Kreislauferkrankungen kann durch praventivmedizinische Masnahmen, wie Gesundheitsforderungsprogramme fur die Bevolkerung, in allen Stadien entgegengewirkt werden. Fur eine wirkungsvolle Pravention von Herz-Kreislauferkrankungen ist es notwendig, die Risikofaktoren, die zu Herz-Kreislauferkrankungen fuhren, zu identifizieren und zu reduzieren. Ein Grosteil dieser Risikofaktoren sind lebensstilassoziiert und sind modifizierbar. Diese modifizierbaren Risikofaktoren sind Rauchen, Hypertonie, Ernahrung, Dyslipidamie, korperliche Inaktivitat, Ubergewicht, Adipositas und Diabetes mellitus und eine Optimierung des Lebensstils sollte deshalb bei allen Erwachsenen angestrebt werden. Geschlechtsspezifische Unterschiede konnen auch eine Rolle in der Inzidenz und Pravention von Herz-Kreislauferkrankungen spielen. Bei Frauen steigt die Inzidenz von Myokardinfarkt signifikant nach der Menopause an. Auserdem ist die Mortalitat der KHK hoher als bei Mannern. Hormonstatus, die Einnahme von oralen Kontrazeptiva und Schwangerschaft beeinflussen das Risiko fur Herz-Kreislauferkrankungen bei Frauen. Aufgrund der enormen Probleme, die Herz-Kreislauferkrankungen fur die Bevolkerung darstellen, und des grosen Potentials im Risikomanagement der koronaren Herzkrankheit durch die Praventivmedizin wurden Gesundheitsforderungs- und Praventionsprogramme eingesetzt. Dieser Bericht prasentiert eine Analyse der modifizierbaren kardiovaskularen Risikofaktoren sowie einen Review der gezielten Praventionsprogramme, die die Pravalenz der Risikofaktoren fur Herz-Kreislauferkrankungen durch Lebensstiloptimierung in der Bevolkerung reduzieren wollen.",2004,Wiener Medizinische Wochenschrift
Behaviour of Antarctic Petrels and Antarctic Fulmars before laying,"Antarctic Petrels Thalassoica antarctica and Antractic Fulmars Fulmarus glacialoides nest in adjoining areas on Odbert and Ardery Islands, Wilkes Land, Antarctica. Observation of their arrival, nesting location, courtship displays and copulation revealed similarities but also some marked differences between the species. Antarctic Petrels deserted the nesting area before laying, whereas Antarctic Fulmars probably remained at their nests. The full sequence of arrival, courtship and copulation was much more compressed in the Antarctic Petrels than in the Fulmars. Courtship and copulation are described and discussed.",1977,Emu
The pierced lasso topology leptin has a bolt on dynamic domain composed by the disordered loops I and III.,"Leptin is an important signaling hormone, mostly known for its role in energy expenditure and satiety. Furthermore, leptin plays a major role in other proteinopathies such as cancer, marked hyperphagia, impaired immune function, and inflammation. Despite its biological relevance in human health, there are no NMR resonance assignments of the human protein available, obscuring high-resolution characterization of the soluble protein and/or its conformational dynamics, suggested to be important for receptor interaction and biological activity. Here, we report the nearly complete backbone resonance assignments of human leptin. Chemical shift-based secondary structure prediction confirms that in solution leptin forms a four-helix bundle including a pierced lasso topology. The conformational dynamics, determined on several time scales, show that leptin is monomeric, has a rigid four-helix scaffold, and a dynamic domain including a transiently formed helix. The dynamic domain is anchored to the helical scaffold by a secondary hydrophobic core, pinning down the long loops of leptin to the protein body, inducing motional restriction without well-defined secondary or tertiary hydrogen bond stabilized structure. This dynamic region is well suited for and may be involved in functional allosteric dynamics upon receptor binding.",2020,Journal of molecular biology
Sparse Coding for Efficient Bioacoustic Data Mining: Preliminary Application to Analysis of Whale Songs,"Bioacoustic monitoring, such as surveys of animal populations and migration, needs efficient data mining methods to extract information from large datasets covering multi-year and multi-location recordings. This paper introduces a method for sparse coding of bioacoustic recordings in order to efficiently compress and automatically extract patterns in data. We demonstrate the proposed method on the analysis of humpback whale songs. Previous work suggests that the structure of these songs can be characterized by successive vocalizations called sound units. Most of these analyses are currently done with expert intervention, but the volume of recordings drive the need for automated methods for sound unit classification. This paper proposes that sparse coding of the song at different time scales supports the distinction of stable song components versus those which evolve year to year. The approach is summarized as: first, an unsupervised method is used to encode the entire bioacoustic dataset into a dictionary, second, sparse coding is used to limit the number of elements in the dictionary, third, salient features are identified using the Lasso algorithm, and finally, an interpretation of the evolving and stable components of the songs is derived, supporting an analysis of year to year variation. It is shown that shorter codes are more stable, occurring with similar frequency across two consecutive years, while the occurrence of longer units varies across years as expected based on the prior manual analysis. 250 ms segments appear to be an appropriate length for encoding stable features of whale songs, possibly corresponding to subunits. We conclude by exploring further possibilities of the application of this method for biopopulation analysis.",2015,2015 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshop (ICDMW)

Distributed Multi-Task Learning,"We consider the problem of distributed multitask learning, where each machine learns a separate, but related, task. Specifically, each machine learns a linear predictor in high-dimensional space, where all tasks share the same small support. We present a communication-efficient estimator based on the debiased lasso and show that it is comparable with the optimal centralized method.",2016,
SAGA and Restricted Strong Convexity,"SAGA is a fast incremental gradient method on the finite sum problem and its effectiveness has been tested on a vast of applications. In this paper, we analyze SAGA on a class of non-strongly convex and non-convex statistical problem such as Lasso, group Lasso, Logistic regression with $\ell_1$ regularization, linear regression with SCAD regularization and Correct Lasso. We prove that SAGA enjoys the linear convergence rate up to the statistical estimation accuracy, under the assumption of restricted strong convexity (RSC). It significantly extends the applicability of SAGA in convex and non-convex optimization.",2017,arXiv: Machine Learning
