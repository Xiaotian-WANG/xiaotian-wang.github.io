Modeling daily guest count prediction,"We present a novel method for analyzing data with temporal variations. In particular, the problem of modeling daily guest count forecast for a restaurant with more than 60 chain stores is presented. We study the transaction data collected from each store, perform data preprocessing and feature constructions for the data. We then discuss different forecasting techniques based on data mining and machine learning techniques. A new modeling algorithm SW-LAR-LASSO is proposed. We compare multiple regression model, poisson regression model, and the proposed SW-LAR-LASSO model for prediction. Experimental results show that the approach of combining sliding windows and LAR-LASSO produces the best results with the highest precision. This approach can also be applied to other areas where temporal variations exist in the data.",2017,
Accurate and Scalable Image Clustering Based on Sparse Representation of Camera Fingerprint,"Clustering images according to their acquisition devices is a well-known problem in multimedia forensics, which is typically faced by means of camera sensor pattern noise (SPN). Such an issue is challenging since SPN is a noise-like signal, hard to be estimated, and easy to be attenuated or destroyed by many factors. Moreover, the high dimensionality of SPN hinders large-scale applications. Existing approaches are typically based on the correlation among SPNs in the pixel domain, which might not be able to capture intrinsic data structure in the union of vector subspaces. In this paper, we propose an accurate clustering framework, which exploits linear dependences among SPNs in their intrinsic vector subspaces. Such dependences are encoded under sparse representations, which are obtained by solving an LASSO problem with non-negativity constraint. The proposed framework is highly accurate in a number of clustersâ€™ estimation and image association. Moreover, our framework is scalable to the number of images and robust against double JPEG compression as well as the presence of outliers, owning big potential for real-world applications. Experimental results on Dresden and Vision database show that our proposed framework can adapt well to both medium-scale and large-scale contexts and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.",2019,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security
Determinants of consumption-day amounts applicable for the estimation of usual dietary intake with a short 24-h food list,"Next to the information on frequency of food consumption, information on consumption-day amounts is important to estimate usual dietary intake in epidemiological studies. Our objective was to identify determinants of consumption-day amounts to derive person-specific standard consumption-day amounts applicable for the estimation of usual dietary intake using separate sources to assesss information on consumption probability and amount consumed. 24-h Dietary recall data from the German National Nutrition Survey II (nÂ =Â 8522; aged 20-80 years) conducted between 2005 and 2007 were analysed for determinants of consumption-day amounts of thirty-eight food and beverage groups using LASSO variable selection for linear mixed-effects models. Determinants included sex, age, BMI, smoking status, years of education, household net income, living status and employment status. Most often, sex, age and smoking status were selected as predictors for consumption-day amounts across thirty-eight food groups. In contrast, living with a partner, employment status and household net income were less frequently chosen. Overall, different determinants were of relevance for different food groups. The number of selected determinants ranged from eight for coffee and juice to zero for cabbage, tea, root vegetables, leafy vegetables, fruit vegetables, legumes, offal, vegetable oils, and other fats. For the estimation of usual dietary intake in a combined approach with a 24-h food list, person-specific standard consumption-day amounts could be used. Sex, age and smoking status were shown to be the most relevant predictors in our analysis. Their impact on the estimation of usual dietary intake needs to be evaluated in future studies.",2016,Journal of Nutritional Science

Estimation for counting processes with high-dimensional covariates,"Nous cherchons a estimer lâ€™intensite de sauts dâ€™un processus de comptage en presence dâ€™un grand nombre de covariables. Nous proposons deux approches. Dâ€™abord, nous considerons une intensite non-parametrique et nous lâ€™estimons par le meilleur modele de Cox etant donne deux dictionnaires de fonctions. Le premier dictionnaire est utilise pour construire une approximation du logarithme du risque de base et le second pour approximer le risque relatif. Nous considerons une procedure Lasso, specifique a la grande dimension, pour estimer simultanement les deux parametres inconnus du meilleur modele de Cox approximant lâ€™intensite. Nous prouvons des inegalites oracles non-asymptotiques pour lâ€™estimateur Lasso obtenu. Dans une seconde partie, nous supposons que lâ€™intensite satisfait un modele de Cox. Nous proposons deux procedures en deux etapes pour estimer les parametres inconnus du modele de Cox. La premiere etape est commune aux deux procedures, il sâ€™agit dâ€™estimer le parametre de regression en grande dimension via une procedure Lasso.

The huge Package for High-dimensional Undirected Graph Estimation in R,"We describe an R package named huge which provides easy-to-use functions for estimating high dimensional undirected graphs from data. This package implements recent results in the literature, including Friedman et al. (2007), Liu et al. (2009, 2012) and Liu et al. (2010). Compared with the existing graph estimation package glasso, the huge package provides extra features: (1) instead of using Fortan, it is written in C, which makes the code more portable and easier to modify; (2) besides fitting Gaussian graphical models, it also provides functions for fitting high dimensional semiparametric Gaussian copula models; (3) more functions like data-dependent model selection, data generation and graph visualization; (4) a minor convergence problem of the graphical lasso algorithm is corrected; (5) the package allows the user to apply both lossless and lossy screening rules to scale up large-scale problems, making a tradeoff between computational and statistical efficiency.",2012,Journal of machine learning research : JMLR
"Second Issue, 2017","After the successful publication of the first issue of Statistical Theory and Related Fields in August, we are very happy to see the second issue in print. We would like to take this opportunity to express our sincere gratitude to all the supporters of this journal. Following the first issue, Statistical Theory and Related Fields continues to publish significant and original articles inmodern statistical theory and applications in natural, economical, medical and social sciences. The first article in the second issue by Li, Fine and Pencina is a review paper for the statistical analysis of diagnostic accuracy in a multi-category classification task. The paper reviews important statistical concepts formulti-category classification accuracy and their utilities, demonstrated with real medical examples and problem-based R code. The next three papers are in precision medicine and personalisedmedical treatments. Zhou, Dai, Zheng and Cai applied a non-parametric inverse probabilityweighted kernel estimating equation to provide accurate and dynamic age-specific risk prediction in precision medicine. Their approach facilitates the utilisation of predictors varying over an individualâ€™s lifetime, and allows borrowing information across individuals of similar ages. Xiong, Yu and Shao proposed a single-index contrast functionmodel for treatment recommendation in personalised medicine. They adopted a non-parametric kernel method to construct treatment rules that are asymptotically optimal. The short communication by Luo is an abstract of the authorâ€™s PhD thesis in the problem of finding a solution to the treatment assignment when there are multiple treatments. The next four articles are in the general area of Bayesian analysis. Caoâ€™s article provided a Bayesian functional enrichment analysis of high-throughput experiment results to identify genes or proteins with certain characteristics, gain more insights into the underlying biology, and provide functional interpretation for the identified genes or proteins. Jha, Li and Guha developed a cost-effective Markov chain Monte Carlo strategy for censored outcomes in a semiparametric Bayesian analysis, motivated by the study of breast cancer mortality rates in New Mexico. The results offered insights into differences in breast cancer mortality rates between ethnic groups, tumour grade and spatial effect of counties. The next article by Liang, Habiger and Min focused on the influence of a misspecified covariance structure on false discovery rate for the large-scale multiple testing problem. They evaluated the influence on the marginal distribution of local false discovery rate statistics related to Bayesian posterior probabilities, under both correctly specified and incorrectly specified models. Tang, Liu and Xu studied Bayesian and maximum-likelihood estimation based on data augmentationmethod in a zero-and-oneinflated Poisson model. The method was illustrated by the analyses of data-sets from Legionnairesâ€™ disease in Singapore and from accidental rates data in Detroit, Michigan. Partially linear or partially nonlinear models are important extensions of the traditional linear models in studying relationship between a response and some covariates. Que, Huang and Zhang in their article applied the generalised least square estimation and B-splinesmethod to estimate the link function and variance components related to random effects. Both theoretical and empirical results were derived. The paper by Li, Li and Tong proposed a sequential profile lasso method for screening the linear predictors in an ultrahigh-dimensional partially linear model. The proposed procedure can detect all relevant predictors with probability tending to one, regardless of whether the ultrahigh model involves a non-parametric part or not. An extended Bayesian information criterion was also added to select the best model among the models generated by the sequential profile lasso method. High-dimensional issue is also addressed in the next paper by Marino and Li in factor analysis of correlation matrices based on contemporary data for biomedical studies, disease surveillance and genetics, in which the number of variables may be much larger than the sample size. Motivated by the study of annual cancer mortality rate in the United States, the authors developed an approach based on group sequential theory to estimate the number of relevant factors to be extracted. To facilitate interpretation of the extracted factors, they used a Bayesian information criterion to produce a sparse factor loading representation. The Current Population Survey is the oldest household sample survey in the United States conducted monthly to provide estimates of employment, unemployment and other characteristics of the noninstitutionalised civilian population 16 years of age and older. In the paper by Cheng, Shao and Yu, they derived an estimation procedure that improves the currently used composite type estimator for monthly population total in terms of the mean-squared error of estimators.",2017,Statistical Theory and Related Fields
Optimal designs in sparse linear models,"The Lasso approach is widely adopted for screening and estimating active effects in sparse linear models with quantitative factors. Many design schemes have been proposed based on different criteria to make the Lasso estimator more accurate. This article applies $$\varPhi _l$$Î¦l-optimality to the asymptotic covariance matrix of the Lasso estimator. Smaller mean squared error and higher power of significant hypothesis tests can be achieved. A theoretically converging algorithm is given for searching for $$\varPhi _l$$Î¦l-optimal designs, and modified by intermittent diffusion to avoid local solutions. Some simulations are given to support the theoretical results.",2019,Metrika

Comparison of the analyses of the XVth QTLMAS common dataset II: QTL analysis,"BackgroundThe QTLMAS XVth dataset consisted of the pedigrees, marker genotypes and quantitative trait performances of 2,000 phenotyped animals with a half-sib family structure. The trait was regulated by 8 QTL which display additive, imprinting or epistatic effects. This paper aims at comparing the QTL mapping results obtained by six participants of the workshop.MethodsDifferent regression, GBLUP, LASSO and Bayesian methods were applied for QTL detection. The results of these methods are compared based on the number of correctly mapped QTL, the number of false positives, the accuracy of the QTL location and the estimation of the QTL effect.ResultsAll the simulated QTL, except the interacting QTL on Chr5, were identified by the participants. Depending on the method, 3 to 7 out of the 8 QTL were identified. The distance to the real location and the accuracy of the QTL effect varied to a large extent depending on the methods and complexity of the simulated QTL.ConclusionsWhile all methods were fairly efficient in detecting QTL with additive effects, it was clear that for non-additive situations, such as parent-of-origin effects or interactions, the BayesC method gave the best results by detecting 7 out of the 8 simulated QTL, with only two false positives and a good precision (less than 1 cM away on average). Indeed, if LASSO could detect QTL even in complex situations, it was associated with too many false positive results to allow for efficient GWAS. GENMIX, a method based on the phylogenies of local haplotypes, also appeared as a promising approach, which however showed a few more false positives when compared with the BayesC method.",2012,BMC Proceedings
Survival Analysis by Penalized Regression and Matrix Factorization,"Because every disease has its unique survival pattern, it is necessary to find a suitable model to simulate followups. DNA microarray is a useful technique to detect thousands of gene expressions at one time and is usually employed to classify different types of cancer. We propose combination methods of penalized regression models and nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) for predicting survival. We tried L1- (lasso), L2- (ridge), and L1-L2 combined (elastic net) penalized regression for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients' microarray data and found that L1-L2 combined method predicts survival best with the smallest logrank P value. Furthermore, 80% of selected genes have been reported to correlate with carcinogenesis or lymphoma. Through NMF we found that DLBCL patients can be divided into 4 groups clearly, and it implies that DLBCL may have 4 subtypes which have a little different survival patterns. Next we excluded some patients who were indicated hard to classify in NMF and executed three penalized regression models again. We found that the performance of survival prediction has been improved with lower logrank P values. Therefore, we conclude that after preselection of patients by NMF, penalized regression models can predict DLBCL patients' survival successfully.",2013,The Scientific World Journal
Abstract 1027: Multiple Biomarkers for Long-Term Risk Stratification in Patients With Coronary Artery Disease,"Background-Multiple biomarkers have been suggested for risk prediction in coronary artery disease. Results of single and multimarker approaches have remained inconsistent. Methods and Results-We prospectively investigated 12 biomarkers reflecting inflammation (C-reactive protein, growth-differentiation factor (GDF)-15, neopterin), oxidative stress (Cu/Zn-superoxiddismutase), lipid metabolism (apolipoproteins AI, B100), renal function (cystatin C), cardiovascular function and remodeling (copeptin, C-terminal-pro-endothelin-1, mid-regional-pro-adrenomedullin (MR-proADM), midregional-pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (MR-pro-ANP), and N-terminal-pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (Nt-proBNP) in 1781 stable angina patients in relation to non-fatal myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death (n=137) over a median follow-up of 3.6 years. Using Cox regression models and C-indices, the strongest association with outcome in the validation set was observed for MR-proADM, cystatin C, GDF-15, Nt-proBNP, and MR-proANP. We developed two risk scores from forward stepwise variable selection (Nt-proBNP and GDF-15; HR 1.46, 1.12â€“1.91; C-index 0.73), through Lasso method (MR-proADM, MR-proANP, neopterin, GDF-15, Nt-proBNP; HR 1.43, 1.11â€“1.83; C-index 0.73), which performed similar to the top five single markers. Each top single marker and the scores added incremental predictive information beyond the baseline model (all p Conclusions-Comparative analysis of 12 biomarkers revealed MR-proADM, cystatin C, GDF-15, and the natriuretic peptides Nt-proBNP and MR-proANP as the strongest predictors of cardiovascular outcome in stable angina. All five biomarkers offered incremental predictive ability over established risk factors as single markers or incorporated in scores.",2009,Circulation

Flow Experiences: From Mystery to Mechanism,"The lead guitarist of R.E.M, Peter Buck, once made the following observation about the bandâ€™s most famous song: 
When I think about Losing My Religion, I think about the process of writing and recording it, and how dream-like and effortless it was. The music was written in five minutes; the first time the band played it, it fell into place perfectly. Michael had lyrics within the hour, and while playing the song for the third or fourth time, I found myself incredibly moved to hear the vocals in conjunction with the music. To me, Losing My Religion feels like some kind of archetype that was floating around in space that we managed to lasso. If only all song writing was this easy.",2015,
Clear cell renal cell carcinoma: CT-based radiomics features for the prediction of Fuhrman grade.,"OBJECTIVES
To discriminate low grade (Fuhrman I/II) and high grade (Fuhrman III/IV) clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC) by using CT-based radiomic features.


METHODS
161 and 99 patients diagnosed with low and high grade CCRCCs from January 2011 to May 2018 were enrolled in this study. 1029 radiomic features were extracted from corticomedullary (CMP), and nephrographic phase (NP) CT images of all patients. We used interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression method to select features, then the selected features were constructed three classification models (CMP, NP and with their combination) to discriminate high and low grades CCRCC. These three models were built by logistic regression method using 5-fold cross validation strategy, evaluated with receiver operating characteristics curve (ROC) and compared using DeLong test.


RESULTS
We found 11 and 24 CMP and NP features were independently significantly associated with the Fuhrman grades. The model of CMP, NP and Combined model using radiomic feature set showed diagnostic accuracy of 0.719 (AUC [area under the curve], 0.766; 95% CI [confidence interval]: 0.709-0.816; sensitivity, 0.602; specificity, 0.838), 0.738 (AUC, 0.818; 95% CI:0.765-0.838; sensitivity, 0.693; specificity, 0.838), 0.777(AUC, 0.822; 95% CI: 0.769-0.866; sensitivity, 0.677; specificity, 0.839). There were significant differences in AUC between CMP model and Combined model (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.0208), meanwhile, the differences between CMP model and NP model, NP model and Combined model reached no significant (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.0844, 0.7915).


CONCLUSIONS
Radiomic features could be used as biomarker for the preoperative evaluation of the CCRCC Fuhrman grades.",2018,European journal of radiology
An Alignment-Free Regression Approach for Estimating Allele-Specific Expression Using RNA-Seq Data,"RNA-seq technology enables large-scale studies of allele-specific expression ASE, or the expression difference between maternal and paternal alleles. Here, we study ASE in animals for which parental RNA-seq data are available. While most methods for determining ASE rely on read alignment, read alignment either leads to reference bias or requires knowledge of genomic variants in each parental strain. When RNA-seq data are available for both parental strains of a hybrid animal, it is possible to infer ASE with minimal reference bias and without knowledge of parental genomic variants. Our approach first uses parental RNA-seq reads to discover maternal and paternal versions of transcript sequences. Using these alternative transcript sequences as features, we estimate abundance levels of transcripts in the hybrid animal using a modified lasso linear regression model. 
 
We tested our methods on synthetic data from the mouse transcriptome and compared our results with those of Trinity, a state-of-the-art de novo RNA-seq assembler. Our methods achieved high sensitivity and specificity in both identifying expressed transcripts and transcripts exhibiting ASE. We also ran our methods on real RNA-seq mouse data from two F1 samples with wild-derived parental strains and were able to validate known genes exhibiting ASE, as well as confirm the expected maternal contribution ratios in all genes and genes on the X chromosome.",2014,
Fast LASSO based DOA tracking,"In this paper, we propose a sequential, fast DOA tracking technique using the measurements of a uniform linear sensor array in the far field of a set of narrow band sources. Our approach is based on sparse approximation technique LASSO (Least Absolute Shrincage and Selection Operator), which has recently gained considerable interest for DOA and other estimation problems. Considering the LASSO optimization as a Bayesian estimation, we first define a class of prior distributions suitable for the sparse representation of the model and discuss its relation to the priors over DOAs and waveforms. Inspired by the Kalman filtering method, we introduce a nonlinear sequential filter on this family of distributions. We derive the filter for a simple random walk motion model of the DOAs. The method consists of consecutive implementation of weighted LASSO optimizations using each new measurement and updating the LASSO weights for the next step.",2011,2011 4th IEEE International Workshop on Computational Advances in Multi-Sensor Adaptive Processing (CAMSAP)
Multielectrode basket catheter: a new tool for curing atrial fibrillation?,"m s a d e d o e r S c N t r c p c s m c l b i l t t c r o Over the last decade, considerable advances have been ade in both the understanding and the curative treatment f atrial fibrillation (AF), with excellent results even in atients with persistent and permanent AF. Pulmonary vein PV) isolation as initially proposed by Haissaguerre et al as several disadvantages and a relatively low success rate, articularly in patients with long-lasting AF. PV isolation is uch less effective, particularly in patients with persistent F, because PV isolation alone affects only triggers of AF. herefore, it has become increasingly clear that to improve he clinical outcome of PV isolation strategy, elimination of V triggers alone may not be sufficient but must be comined with substrate modification. Success rates have mproved with the evolution and development of PV isolaion, but more extensive and deeper lesions have brought the pectra of important complications, such as atrio-esophaeal fistula and cardiac perforation. If PV isolation with ore extensive lesions can produce better outcomes, the rucial question is how extensive the lesions must be to aintain or even increase the success rate while minimizing isk and complications. PV disconnection has been guided y different mapping systems. More recently, circumferenial lesions around PV ostia have been reported in patients ith paroxysmal or persistent AF by using the Constellation ultielectrode basket catheter in combination with the Asronomer nonfluoroscopic three-dimensional navigation ystem. Isolation of PV antra guided by intracardiac echoardiography has been reported as an alternative approach or curing AF, but this technique has some technical limiations. Because the PV antrum has a large diameter, a tationary Lasso catheter located in just one position in rder to locate PV potentials cannot map its circumference. he oblique nature of the antralâ€“left atrium interface makes tabilization of the Lasso catheter difficult, particularly at hallenging sites such as anterior segments of the left PVs r septal segments of the right PVs. Therefore, in patients ndergoing PV antra isolation, catheter stability, although ime-consuming, should be considered a crucial endpoint. In",2006,Heart rhythm
mLASSO-Hum: A LASSO-based interpretable human-protein subcellular localization predictor.,"Knowing the subcellular compartments of human proteins is essential to shed light on the mechanisms of a broad range of human diseases. In computational methods for protein subcellular localization, knowledge-based methods (especially gene ontology (GO) based methods) are known to perform better than sequence-based methods. However, existing GO-based predictors often lack interpretability and suffer from overfitting due to the high dimensionality of feature vectors. To address these problems, this paper proposes an interpretable multi-label predictor, namely mLASSO-Hum, which can yield sparse and interpretable solutions for large-scale prediction of human protein subcellular localization. By using the one-vs-rest LASSO-based classifiers, 87 out of more than 8000 GO terms are found to play more significant roles in determining the subcellular localization. Based on these 87 essential GO terms, we can decide not only where a protein resides within a cell, but also why it is located there. To further exploit information from the remaining GO terms, a method based on the GO hierarchical information derived from the depth distance of GO terms is proposed. Experimental results show that mLASSO-Hum performs significantly better than state-of-the-art predictors. We also found that in addition to the GO terms from the cellular component category, GO terms from the other two categories also play important roles in the final classification decisions. For readers' convenience, the mLASSO-Hum server is available online at http://bioinfo.eie.polyu.edu.hk/mLASSOHumServer/.",2015,Journal of theoretical biology
Thresholding tests.,"We derive a new class of statistical tests for generalized linear models based on thresholding point estimators. These tests can be employed whether the model includes more parameters than observations or not. For linear models, our tests rely on pivotal statistics derived from model selection techniques. Affine lasso, a new extension of lasso, allows to unveil new tests and to develop in the same framework parametric and nonparametric tests. Our tests for generalized linear models are based on new asymptotically pivotal statistics. A composite thresholding test attempts to achieve uniformly most power under both sparse and dense alternatives with success. In a simulation, we compare the level and power of these tests under sparse and dense alternative hypotheses. The thresholding tests have a better control of the nominal level and higher power than existing tests.",2018,arXiv: Methodology
Fused LASSO penalized least absolute deviation estimator for high dimensional linear regression,"The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) has been playing an important role in variable selection and dimensionality reduction for high dimensional linear regression under the zero-mean or Gaussian assumptions of the noises. However, these assumptions may not hold in practice. In this case, the least absolute deviation is a popular and useful method. In this paper, we focus on the least absolute deviation via Fused LASSO, called Robust Fused LASSO, under the assumption that the unknown vector is sparsity for both the coefficients and its successive differences. Robust Fused LASSO estimator does not need any knowledge of standard deviation of the noises or any moment assumptions of the noises. We show that the Robust Fused LASSO estimator possesses near oracle performance, i.e. with large probability, the \begin{document} $\ell_2$ \end{document} norm of the estimation error is of order \begin{document} $O(\sqrt{k(\log p)/n})$ \end{document} . The result is true for a wide range of noise distributions, even for the Cauchy distribution. In addition, we apply the linearized alternating direction method of multipliers to find the Robust Fused LASSO estimator, which possesses the global convergence. Numerical results are reported to demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed method.",2018,"Numerical Algebra, Control and Optimization"
Significant EHR Feature-Driven T2D Inference: Predictive Machine Learning and Networks,"Background. Electronic Health Records (EHR) play an important role for the redefinition of phenotypes in view of the wealth and heterogeneity of information now available from disparate data sources. A recent cross-sectional retrospective study has described the potential of EHR toward type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) screening when ad hoc models are used. About 10,000 US patients have been analyzed through a variety of inference techniques applied to all records with a variable degree of completeness. The analyses conducted in the reference study have indicated that EHR phenotypes significantly improved T2D detection. Methods. With these US patients and the T2D data evidenced in the above study, we propose an integrative inference approach that leverages the prediction power of EHR features selected by two well-known methods, Random Forests and Lasso. The goal is twofold: reducing the big data redundancies potentially harmful to the predictive learning task and exploiting the inter-connectivity of EHR features. A mutual information (MI) network is the inference tool used to identify communities useful to prioritize significant T2D features underlying the similarity between patients. Results. Endowed with a different degree of granularity, the communities detected after the application of both methods were centered especially on T2D comorbidities and risk factors. As such, they appear very relevant for assessment of two main issues, T2D disease burden and prevention. Conclusions. Our analytical approach offers a solution for managing the EHR scale factor in a complex disease context. EHR are rich sources of phenotypic diversity through which novel stratifications of patients are expected. To enable these results, both pre-screening of variables and calibration of risk prediction methods become necessary steps in EHR analyses. We have presented networks identifying major T2D communities. The specific significance assigned to comorbidities and risk factors in relation to T2D can be inferred with accuracy from just a suitably reduced number of EHR features.",2019,
Machine Learning for Outcome Prediction in Electroencephalograph (EEG)-Monitored Children in the Intensive Care Unit,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of models predicting in-hospital mortality in critically ill children undergoing continuous electroencephalography (cEEG) in the intensive care unit (ICU). We evaluated the performance of machine learning algorithms for predicting mortality in a database of 414 critically ill children undergoing cEEG in the ICU. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in the test subset was highest for stepwise selection/elimination models (AUC = 0.82) followed by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and support vector machine with linear kernel (AUC = 0.79), and random forest (AUC = 0.71). The explanatory models had the poorest discriminative performance (AUC = 0.63 for the model without considering etiology and AUC = 0.45 for the model considering etiology). Using few variables and a relatively small number of patients, machine learning techniques added information to explanatory models for prediction of in-hospital mortality.",2018,Journal of Child Neurology
Supplementing Claims Data with Electronic Medical Records to Improve Estimation and Classification of Rheumatoid Arthritis Disease Activity: A Machine Learning Approach,"Objective
Previous attempts to estimate rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease activity using claims data only did not yield high performance. We aimed to assess whether supplementing claims data with readily available electronic medical record (EMR) data might result in improvement.


Methods
We used a subset of the Brigham and Women's Hospital Rheumatoid Arthritis Sequential Study (BRASS) that had linked Medicare claims. The disease activity score in 28 joints with C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP) was considered the gold standard of measure. Variables in the linked Medicare claims, as well as EMR recorded in the preceding one-year period were used as potential explanatory variables. We constructed three models: ""Claims-Only,"" ""Claims + Medications,"" and ""Claims + Medications + Labs (laboratory data from EMR). We selected variables via adaptive LASSO. Model performance was measured with adjusted R2 for continuous DAS28-CRP and C-statistics for binary category classification (high/moderate vs low disease activity/remission).


Results
We identified 300 patients with laboratory data and linked Medicare claims. The mean age was 68 years and 80% were female. The mean (SD) DAS28-CRP was 3.6 (1.6) and 51% had high or moderate DAS28-CRP. For the continuous estimation, the adjusted R2 was 0.02 for Claims-Only, 0.09 for Claims + Medications, and 0.18 for Claims + Medications + Labs. The C-statistics for discriminating the binary categories were 0.61 for Claims-Only, 0.68 for Claims + Medications, and 0.76 for Claims + Medications + Labs.


Conclusion
Adding EMR-derived variables to claims-derived variables resulted in modest improvement. Even with EMR variables, we were unable to estimate continuous DAS28-CRP satisfactorily. However, in claims-EMR models, we were able to discriminate between binary categories of disease activity with reasonable accuracy.",2019,Acr Open Rheumatology
Analysis of the intersexual variation in Thalassophryne maculosa fish venoms.,"Gender related variation in the molecular composition of venoms and secretions have been described for some animal species, and there are some evidences that the difference in the toxin (s) profile among males and females may be related to different physiopathological effects caused by the envenomation by either gender. In order to investigate whether this same phenomenon occurs to the toadfish Thalassophryne maculosa, we have compared some biological and biochemical properties of female and male venoms. Twenty females and males were collected in deep waters of the La Restinga lagoon (Venezuela) and, after protein concentration assessed, the induction of toxic activities in mice and the biochemical properties were analyzed. Protein content is higher in males than in females, which may be associated to a higher size and weight of the male body. InÂ vivo studies showed that mice injected with male venoms presented higher nociception when compared to those injected with female venoms, and both venoms induced migration of macrophages into the paw of mice. On the other hand, mice injected with female venoms had more paw edema and extravasation of Evans blue in peritoneal cavity than mice injected with male venoms. We observed that the female venoms had more capacity for necrosis induction when compared with male venoms. The female samples present a higher proteolytic activity then the male venom when gelatin, casein and FRETs were used as substrates. Evaluation of the venoms of females and males by SDS-PAGE and chromatographic profile showed that, at least three components (present in two peaks) are only present in males. Although the severity of the lesion, characterized by necrosis development, is related with the poisoning by female specimens, the presence of exclusive toxins in the male venoms could be associated with the largest capacity of nociception induction by this sample.",2016,Toxicon : official journal of the International Society on Toxinology
Statistical Inference for Large Scale Data April,"We introduce a sparse and positive definite estimator of the covariance matrix designed for high-dimensional situations in which the variables have a known ordering. Our estimator is the solution to a convex optimization problem that involves a hierarchical group lasso penalty. We show how it can be efficiently computed, compare it to other methods such as tapering by a fixed matrix, and develop several theoretical results that demonstrate its strong statistical properties. Finally, we show how using convex banding can improve the performance of high-dimensional procedures such as linear and quadratic discriminant analysis. 2. Speaker: Andreas Buja, The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania Title: (1) Large-p Visualization ; (2) Moderate-p Post-Selection Inference Abstract: This talk will be divided into two short talks. (1) Large-p Visualization: Data with large numbers of variables pose a challenge for data exploration and visualization. Facing hundreds of variables, standard tools such as scatterplot matrices and parallel coordinate plots will quickly reach their limit. It may be necessary to abandon detailed visualization of variables and instead show simple summary measures, as in heat maps of correlation tables that are often found in genomics. In this talk we use a modification of heat maps, here called â€œblockplotsâ€, and we demonstrate an associated software tool that is both interactive and dynamic, yet wholly written in R. Called â€œAssociation Navigatorâ€, its basic operation is zooming and panning of large â€œblockplotsâ€ of correlation tables involving hundreds of variables. The tool includes, among other things: (1) display of p-values and missing value patterns in addition to correlations, (2) mark-up facilities to highlight variables and sub-tables as landmarks when navigating the larger table, (3) histograms / barcharts, scatterplots and scatterplot matrices as â€œlensesâ€ into the distributions of variables and variable pairs, as well as several other functionalities. The usefulness of the tool is less in beholding gigantic tables in their entirety and more in searching for interesting association patterns by navigating manageable but numerous and interconnected sub-tables. (2) Moderate-p Post-Selection Inference: Berk et al. (AoS 2013) proposed a stringent approach, called â€œPoSIâ€, to producing statistical inference that is valid after arbitrary variable selection in regression. The approach is controversial because of its conservative nature, yet it is the appropriate method of securing valid statistical inference after what is called p-hacking or p-value hunting. This, however, is not the main subject of the talk. Rather, it is the computational limitations of the PoSI approach. Currently our algorithm can handle up to about p = 20 predictor variables in an unconstrained model search. For â€œsparse PoSIâ€ we can handle up to about p = 80 predictors if model search is limited to model sizes 4 and lower. The algorithm relies both on a deterministic integration and a Monte Carlo simulation. It would be desirable for speeding up the algorithm if we better understood the underlying geometry of predictor adjustment. This part of the talk will therefore end with open questions.

Pathological grading of Hepatocellular Carcinomas in MRI using a LASSO algorithm,"To investigate the predictive ability of Radiomics signature for preoperative pathological grading of Hepatocellular Carcinomas (HCC), the no contrast MRI images were integrated and a comprehensive analysis was conducted to predict clinical outcomes using the radiomics features. Variable selection via LASSO and logistic regression were used to select the most-predictive Radiomics features for the pathological grading. Cross-Validation with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was employed as the prediction metric. Overall, the prediction performances by Radiomics features showed statistically significant correlations with pathological grading, however, improvement on the prediction performance by combining T1WI and T2WI data, classification performance obtained the AUC 0.829 in training dataset and the AUC 0.742 in validation dataset. This study consisted of 170 consecutive patients (training dataset: n=125; validation dataset, n=45).

Feeding choices and morbidity and mortality among children born to HIV-1 infected mothers during the first 6 months of life in Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina Faso),"To examine effects of maternal factors on choice of infant feeding method, and to assess the effects of feeding method and other maternal and infant factors on morbidity and mortality a prospective study was conducted within the Kesho Bora study that evaluated antiretroviral therapy impact on mother to child transmission of human immune deficiency virus 1. Mean age for the mothers was 27.55 years (range 18â€“41 years); 69.3% were homemakers and 41.4% had no formal education. Breastfeeding was chosen by 109 mothers (81.3%) compared to 25 mothers (18.7%) choosing formula feeding. The decision to formula feed was more common among mothers who had disclosed their human immune deficiency virus status to a family member ( P = 0.0036) and among women who had attained a relatively high level of education ( P = 0.001). Morbidity and mortality were assessed for 138 infants (113 exclusively breastfed and 25 formula fed). There were no statistically significant differences in incidence of diarrhea or upper respiratory infection between the two groups of children ( P = 0.7 and P = 0.255, respectively), but formula fed children tended to require more frequent hospital care ( P = 0.016). Infant mortality after the age of 6 months was not statistically different in the two groups of children (7% in the exclusive breastfeeding group compared to 12% in the formula fed group, P = 0.42). Premature birth and low birth weight were associated with a significant risk of infant mortality ( P = 0.001 and P = 0.007 respectively). Considering the prevailing socio-economic conditions in Bobo-Dioulasso, we conclude that exclusive breastfeeding should be the recommended infant feeding method for most women here.",2015,Journal of Pediatric infectious diseases
Estimation and variable selection for semiparametric transformation models under a more efficient cohort sampling design,"Two-phase cohort sampling designs, or sometimes known as retrospective sampling designs, are often used in large cohort studies for saving sampling time and cost. Commonly used designs include caseâ€“cohort design, caseâ€“control design, nested caseâ€“control design, and so on. Efforts had been taken to improve the estimation efficiency under these commonly used designs. We propose a different retrospective sampling design, called end-point design, under the class of semiparametric transformation models. An inverse probability weighting likelihood approach is designed for estimating the model parameters, and the proposed design shows higher efficiency than the caseâ€“cohort and caseâ€“control design with comparable size of covariates ascertainment. We also consider variable selection under the proposed design. A specially designed objective function with adaptive lasso penalty is proposed. The large sample properties of the proposed estimation and variable selection procedure are developed. Extensive simulation studies are carried out to show favorable evidence for the proposed approaches. A real data set is analyzed for illustration.",2018,TEST
LASSO NTCP predictors for the incidence of xerostomia in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma,"To predict the incidence of moderate-to-severe patient-reported xerostomia among head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). Multivariable normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) models were developed by using quality of life questionnaire datasets from 152 patients with HNSCC and 84 patients with NPC. The primary endpoint was defined as moderate-to-severe xerostomia after IMRT. The numbers of predictive factors for a multivariable logistic regression model were determined using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) with bootstrapping technique. Four predictive models were achieved by LASSO with the smallest number of factors while preserving predictive value with higher AUC performance. For all models, the dosimetric factors for the mean dose given to the contralateral and ipsilateral parotid gland were selected as the most significant predictors. Followed by the different clinical and socio-economic factors being selected, namely age, financial status, T stage, and education for different models were chosen. The predicted incidence of xerostomia for HNSCC and NPC patients can be improved by using multivariable logistic regression models with LASSO technique. The predictive model developed in HNSCC cannot be generalized to NPC cohort treated with IMRT without validation and vice versa.",2014,Scientific Reports

Organic matter deposition and paleoenvironmental implications across the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary of the Subalpine Basin (SE France): Local and global controls,"Abstract The Cenomanian-Turonian boundary is marked by global sea-level highstands and one of the warmest periods of the Mesozoic, with high pCO2 levels linked to a massive magmatic episode. This is associated with the establishment of a worldwide marine anoxia, the deposition of organic-rich facies and disturbances of the global carbon cycle, the so-called Oceanic Anoxic Event 2 (OAE2). The Pont d'Issole section's (Subalpine Basin, SE France) sedimentary succession represents the reference record of OAE2 in the Tethyan domain, although its organic fraction is extremely poorly studied. Therefore, the main objectives of this study are the characterization of the Pont d'Issole section's organic matter (OM) for paleoenvironmental interpretation and the assessment of the OM thermal maturity using organic petrology and organic geochemistry techniques. The organic record characterizes a shallowing-up marine system with varying redox and restriction conditions, associated with periods of stratified oxygen regimen. It displays the presence of two OM enrichment episodes with different paleoenvironmental and geodynamic contexts. The first OM enrichment episode (Unit Th1) is thought to be associated with the global mechanisms that trigger OAE2 and is characterized by a palynofacies association co-dominated by amorphous OM and marine microplankton, reflecting a context of high sea-level. This is followed by the Plenus Cold Event (Unit Th2), characterized by a decrease in amorphous OM and increase in marine microplankton, representing a reoxygenation associated with an increase in water level, and an apparent decrease in temperature (disappearance of Classopollis sp.). The second OM enrichment episode (Unit Th3 and base of Unit Th4) is characterized by an association dominated by amorphous OM, the occurrence of freshwater microplankton, and the development of a restricted environment with low sea level. These depositional conditions are thought to be connected to the beginning phases of basin closure, promoted by the regional tectonic framework (compressive trend between Africa and Europe). The molecular fraction showed the presence of unsaturated compounds, monoaromatic steranes, monoaromatic anthrasteroids and the biological Î²Î² hopanes, indicating a low thermal evolution for the OM. This is corroborated by biomarkers ratios and organic petrographic data, namely vitrinite reflectance (0.29% Rr). The presence of Paleozoic reworked OM in the samples was also identified presenting a more complex thermal history than the Cretaceous OM. This OM is possibly related to the subaerial erosion of Hercynian Massifs.",2020,International Journal of Coal Geology
Efficient differentially private learning improves drug sensitivity prediction,"BackgroundUsers of a personalised recommendation system face a dilemma: recommendations can be improved by learning from data, but only if other users are willing to share their private information. Good personalised predictions are vitally important in precision medicine, but genomic information on which the predictions are based is also particularly sensitive, as it directly identifies the patients and hence cannot easily be anonymised. Differential privacy has emerged as a potentially promising solution: privacy is considered sufficient if presence of individual patients cannot be distinguished. However, differentially private learning with current methods does not improve predictions with feasible data sizes and dimensionalities.ResultsWe show that useful predictors can be learned under powerful differential privacy guarantees, and even from moderately-sized data sets, by demonstrating significant improvements in the accuracy of private drug sensitivity prediction with a new robust private regression method. Our method matches the predictive accuracy of the state-of-the-art non-private lasso regression using only 4x more samples under relatively strong differential privacy guarantees. Good performance with limited data is achieved by limiting the sharing of private information by decreasing the dimensionality and by projecting outliers to fit tighter bounds, therefore needing to add less noise for equal privacy.ConclusionsThe proposed differentially private regression method combines theoretical appeal and asymptotic efficiency with good prediction accuracy even with moderate-sized data. As already the simple-to-implement method shows promise on the challenging genomic data, we anticipate rapid progress towards practical applications in many fields.ReviewersThis article was reviewed by Zoltan Gaspari and David Kreil.",2017,Biology Direct
Evaluation of single-date and multi-seasonal spatial and spectral information of Sentinel-2 imagery to assess growing stock volume of a Mediterranean forest,"Abstract Accurate growing stock volume (GSV) estimation is essential for forest inventory updating, terrestrial carbon stocks reporting, and ecosystem services assessment. This study investigates the potential of spectral and spatial features derived from single-date and multi-seasonal Sentinel-2 Multi Spectral Instrument (Sentinel-2 MSI) images, for GSV estimation in a Mediterranean region of Northeastern Greece. Original spectral bands, spectral indices, first-order statistics, Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) texture measures, and Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA), based on the multi-seasonal and single-date Sentinel-2 MSI imagery, were used for GSV model development using the bagging LASSO algorithm. For both single and multi-date approaches, the spectral indices models were more accurate compared to the respective ones developed with the original Sentinel-2 MSI bands. Also, models based on texture were more efficient than the spectral models. The GLCM measures derived from July image, provided the most accurate single-date estimate of GSV (R2â€‰=â€‰0.89, RMSEâ€‰=â€‰35.21), while their multi-seasonal counterparts improved slightly the accuracy (R2â€‰=â€‰0.91, RMSEâ€‰=â€‰32.77). Fusion of spatial and textural information resulted in marginal or no-improvement on the texture model accuracy, however the fused models yielded higher predictive results than the spectral models alone.",2019,Int.

Statistical inference of probabilistic origin-destination demand using day-to-day traffic data,"Abstract Recent transportation network studies on uncertainty and reliability call for modeling the probabilistic O-D demand and probabilistic network flow. Making the best use of day-to-day traffic data collected over many years, this paper develops a novel theoretical framework for estimating the mean and variance/covariance matrix of O-D demand considering the day-to-day variation induced by travelersâ€™ independent route choices. It also estimates the probability distributions of link/path flow and their travel cost where the variance stems from three sources, O-D demand, route choice and unknown errors. The framework estimates O-D demand mean and variance/covariance matrix iteratively, also known as iterative generalized least squares (IGLS) in statistics. Lasso regularization is employed to obtain sparse covariance matrix for better interpretation and computational efficiency. Though the probabilistic O-D estimation (ODE) works with a much larger solution space than the deterministic ODE, we show that its estimator for O-D demand mean is no worse than the best possible estimator by an error that reduces with the increase in sample size. The probabilistic ODE is examined on two small networks and two real-world large-scale networks. The solution converges quickly under the IGLS framework. In all those experiments, the results of the probabilistic ODE are compelling, satisfactory and computationally plausible. Lasso regularization on the covariance matrix estimation leans to underestimate most of variance/covariance entries. A proper Lasso penalty ensures a good trade-off between bias and variance of the estimation.",2019,ArXiv
Tail Event Driven ASset allocation: evidence from equity and mutual fundsâ€™ markets,"The correlation structure across assets and opposite tail movements are essential to the asset allocation problem, since they determine the level of risk in a position. Correlation alone is not informative on the distributional details of the assets. Recently introduced TEDASâ€”Tail Event Driven ASset allocation approach determines the dependence between assets at different tail measures. TEDAS uses adaptive Lasso-based quantile regression in order to determine an active set of negative coefficients. Based on these active risk factors, an adjustment for intertemporal correlation is made. In this research, authors aim to develop TEDAS, by introducing three TEDAS modifications differing in allocation weightsâ€™ determination: a Cornishâ€“Fisher Value-at-Risk minimization, Markowitz diversification rule or naÃ¯ve equal weighting. TEDAS strategies significantly outperform other widely used allocation approaches on two asset markets: German equity and Global mutual funds.",2018,Journal of Asset Management
A Trace Lasso Regularized Ll-norm Graph Cut for Highly Correlated Noisy Hyperspectral Image,"Ahstract-This work proposes an adaptive trace lasso regularized Ll-norm based graph cut method for dimensionality reduction of Hyperspectral images, called as â€˜Trace Lasso-Ll Graph Cutâ€™ (TL-LIGC). The underlying idea of this method is to generate the optimal projection matrix by considering both the sparsity as well as the correlation of the data samples. The conventional L2-norm used in the objective function is sensitive to noise and outliers. Therefore, in this work Ll-norm is utilized as a robust alternative to L2-norm. Besides, for further improvement of the results, we use a penalty function of trace lasso with the LIGC method. It adaptively balances the L2-norm and Ll-norm simultaneously by considering the data correlation along with the sparsity. We obtain the optimal projection matrix by maximizing the ratio of between-class dispersion to within-class dispersion using Ll-norm with trace lasso as the penalty. Furthermore, an iterative procedure for this TL-LIGC method is proposed to solve the optimization function. The effectiveness of this proposed method is evaluated on two benchmark HSI datasets.",2018,2018 26th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)
"Bacterioplanes sanyensis gen. nov., sp. nov., a PHB-accumulating bacterium isolated from a pool of Spirulina platensis cultivation","Abstract
A Gram-negative, poly-3-hydroxybutyrate-accumulating rod bacterium, strain GYP-2T, was isolated from a pool of marine Spirulina platensis cultivation, Sanya, China. Growth was observed at 10â€“45Â Â°C and pH 6â€“10 in the presence of 1â€“10Â % (w/v) NaCl. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that the new isolate belonged to Gammaproteobacteria and displayed 93.8â€“95.3Â % 16S rRNA gene sequences similarities to members of the genera Thalassolituus, Oleibacter, and Oceanobacter, but house-keeping gene gyrB (encode DNA gyrase beta subunit) demonstrated that the new isolate was distantly related to Thalassolituus, Oleibacter, and Oceanobacter species (only 77â€“83Â % gene gyrB sequences similarities).The G+C content of genomic DNA was 55Â mol%. The major respiratory quinone was Q-9, while that for Oceanobacter kriegii LMG 6238T was Q-8. Major polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, and phosphatidylethanolamine. On the basis of its physiological, chemotaxonomic, and molecular properties, strain GYP-2T is suggested to represent a novel species of a new genus in Gammaproteobacteria, for which the name Bacterioplanes sanyensis gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is GYP-2T (=CGMCC 1.12392T=KCTC 32220T).",2014,Archives of Microbiology

An l1-Oracle Inequality for the Lasso,"The Lasso has attracted the attention of many authors these last years. While many efforts have been made to prove that the Lasso behaves like a variable selection procedure at the price of strong (though unavoidable) assumptions on the geometric structure of these variables, much less attention has been paid to the analysis of the performance of the Lasso as a regularization algorithm. Our first purpose here is to provide a conceptually very simple result in this direction. We shall prove that, provided that the regularization parameter is properly chosen, the Lasso works almost as well as the deterministic Lasso. This result does not require any assumption at all, neither on the structure of the variables nor on the regression function. Our second purpose is to introduce a new estimator particularly adapted to deal with infinite countable dictionaries. This estimator is constructed as an l0-penalized estimator among a sequence of Lasso estimators associated to a dyadic sequence of growing truncated dictionaries. The selection procedure automatically chooses the best level of truncation of the dictionary so as to make the best tradeoff between approximation, l1-regularization and sparsity. From a theoretical point of view, we shall provide an oracle inequality satisfied by this selected Lasso estimator. The oracle inequalities established for the Lasso and the selected Lasso estimators shall enable us to derive rates of convergence on a wide class of functions, showing that these estimators perform at least as well as greedy algorithms. Besides, we shall prove that the rates of convergence achieved by the selected Lasso estimator are optimal in the orthonormal case by bounding from below the minimax risk on some Besov bodies. Finally, some theoretical results about the performance of the Lasso for infinite uncountable dictionaries will be studied in the specific framework of neural networks. All the oracle inequalities presented in this paper are obtained via the application of a single general theorem of model selection among a collection of nonlinear models which is a direct consequence of the Gaussian concentration inequality. The key idea that enables us to apply this general theorem is to see l1-regularization as a model selection procedure among l1-balls.",2010,arXiv: Statistics Theory

Lasso screening for object categories recognition using multi-directional context features,"Image representation using local features and sparse coding (SC) plays a very important role in image classification when the dataset is fairly large. Despite of its worldwide popularity, there are still some improving space in classification efficiency and computational investment in training and coding phrase of SC. In this paper, we put forward a novel object categories recognition method from two aspects. First, the contextual relevance between image patches are fully utilized by merging local feature of every sub-patch with its neighboring ones into strong context features to generate the multiple sparse representations, which are received by the SC and multi-scale max pooling SPM(Spatial Pyramid Matching), respectively. Second, while calculating the sparse coefficients of SC, we need to solve L1-regularized least square problem. Screening out the zero coefficients and discarding the corresponding inactive codewords before solving Lasso problem can remarkably speed up the optimization. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art performance in a large number of image categorization experiments on several benchmarks: the ground truth dataset (21 Land-Use database), the event dataset (UIUC-Sport dataset), and the object recognition dataset (Caltech101 dataset).",2015,
Is Cervical Traction Effective in Chronic Nonspecific Neck Pain Patients with Unsatisfactory NSAIDs Control? A Nomogram to Predict the Effectiveness.,"STUDY DESIGN
A retrospective study.


OBJECTIVE
Establishing a nomogram to predict the effectiveness of cervical traction in young and middle-aged chronic nonspecific neck pain (CNNP) patients with unsatisfactory nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) control.


SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA
For CNNP patients with unsatisfactory NSAIDs control, the effectiveness of cervical traction varies. Neck muscle fat infiltration and clinical features may associate with the effectiveness.


METHODS
A total of 186 suitable patients were classified into a training dataset (from August 2015 to July 2018, n=118) and validation dataset (from August 2018 to June 2019, n=68) with time sequence. All patients were included to receive MRI scan to calculate posterior cervical fat and muscle features, then undergoing unified cervical traction in an outpatient clinic. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model was used to select potentially relevant features to predict effectiveness possibility of cervical traction. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to develop the predicting model, presenting with a nomogram. The performance of nomogram was assessed based on its calibration, discrimination, and clinical utility.


RESULTS
Through the Lasso regression model, we identified four predictors including gender, good exercise compliance, the ratio of the cross-sectional area (CSA) between fat and muscle on C5 level (C5 fat CSA/muscle CSA), the ratio of CSA between fat and centrum on C5 level (C5 fat CSA/centrum muscle CSA). The nomogram provided good calibration and discrimination in the training cohort, showing an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.704 (95% CI, 0.608-0.799) and good concordance between the predicted and actual probabilities with Spiegelhalter's Z-test (P=0.835). Discrimination of the model in the validation dataset were acceptable, with AUC of 0.691 (95%CI, 0.564-0.817). Decision curve analysis (DCA) revealed the nomogram was clinically useful.


CONCLUSION
Male, good exercise compliance, lower C5 fat CSA/centrum CSA and C5 fat CSA/muscle CSA could be favorable features to predict the effectiveness cervical traction in CNNP patients with unsatisfactory NSAIDs control.",2020,World neurosurgery
Analysis of Feature-Selection for LASSO Regression Models,To extract features from large data sets is a major issue in data science. Many statistical regression models exist that address this problem with many different approaches. In this project models belonging to the LASSO family are analyzed with respect to their ability and performance on feature selection in the domain of high dimensional data. LASSO models are regularized regression models aiming to create sparse models. The Aim is to develop methods to describe and compare the Feature-Selection behavior of these models with an empirical approach.,2017,

Kurzinterventionen bei Alkoholproblemen im Allgemeinkrankenhaus,"ZusammenfassungHintergrund: Problematischer Alkoholkonsum ist eine der Hauptursachen fÃ¼r Krankhausaufenthalte. Das Ziel dieser Arbeit war, eine Ãœbersicht Ã¼ber verschiedene Arten von alkoholbezogenen Interventionen am Allgemeinkrankenhaus und deren Wirksamkeit zu liefern. Methode: Die Studienauswahl basierte auf einer systematischen Literaturrecherche in PubMed. In Englisch oder Deutsch publizierte Artikel wurden eingeschlossen. Insgesamt wurden zehn Kontrollgruppenstudien gefunden, die alkoholbezogene Kurzinterventionen bei stationÃ¤ren Patienten in AllgemeinkrankenhÃ¤usern untersuchten. Sie verwendeten folgende ErgebnismaÃŸe: Trinkreduktion bzw. â€“abstinenz, biologische Marker, MorbiditÃ¤t, Motivation, alkoholbezogene Probleme. Ergebnisse: Insgesamt wurden vier Interventionsformen untersucht. Sieben Studien fanden positive Interventionseffekte z.B. bezÃ¼glich Trinkreduktion, erhÃ¶hter Motivation oder verringerter alkoholbezogener Probleme. Trinkreduktionseffekte zeigten sich nur nach 6 Monaten, wÃ¤hrend andere Effekte auch spÃ¤ter zu finden waren. Schlussfolgerung: Alkoholbezogene Interventionen im Allgemeinkrankenhaus sind wirksam. Die Interventionen bewirken eine schnellere Trinkreduktion und damit eine schnellere Reduktion alkoholassoziierter Konsequenzen wie MorbiditÃ¤t und alkoholassoziierte Probleme. Da sich bezÃ¼glich Trinkreduktion nur kurzfristige Effekte zeigten, ist Nachsorge eventuell ein wichtiger Faktor, um die dauerhafte Umsetzung des Reduktionsvorhabens im Alltag zu unterstÃ¼tzen.AbstractBackground: One of the main causes for hospital admissions is problematic alcohol consumption. The aim of this review was to provide a summary of different types of brief alcohol interventions (BAI) in general hospitals and to report their effectiveness. Method: The selection of the studies was based on a systematic literature search using PubMed. Articles published in English or German were considered. Studies conducted at specialized hospitals, emergency departments or outpatient clinics were excluded. Ten controlled clinical trials investigating BAI among general hospital inpatients were identified. The studies investigated various outcomes: drinking reduction or abstinence, biological markers, morbidity, motivation and alcohol related problems. Results: Altogether, four intervention types were tested: counseling, skill-based training, education and advice. At follow-up, six studies reported a significant drinking reduction among the treated and non-treated study groups. Seven studies showed positive intervention effects regarding any of the outcomes. Three of four studies with a 6 months follow-up reported intervention effects regarding drinking reduction, whereas all studies with follow-up at month 12 or later did not find a significantly greater drinking reduction among the treated compared to the non-treated patients. However, most of these studies reported intervention effects regarding biological markers, morbidity, motivation, alcohol related problems or other outcomes. Differences in effectiveness for various interventions were not found. Conclusions: The implementation of BAI in general hospitals is recommended. BAI quicken the process of drinking reduction, and with it the reduction of alcohol related problems or morbidity. As only short-term effects were found for drinking reduction, after care seems to be an important factor when providing BAI.",2008,Psychosomatik und Konsiliarpsychiatrie

Evaluation of Machine-Learning Algorithms for Predicting Opioid Overdose Risk Among Medicare Beneficiaries With Opioid Prescriptions,"Importance
Current approaches to identifying individuals at high risk for opioid overdose target many patients who are not truly at high risk.


Objective
To develop and validate a machine-learning algorithm to predict opioid overdose risk among Medicare beneficiaries with at least 1 opioid prescription.


Design, Setting, and Participants
A prognostic study was conducted between September 1, 2017, and December 31, 2018. Participants (nâ€‰=â€‰560â€¯057) included fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries without cancer who filled 1 or more opioid prescriptions from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2015. Beneficiaries were randomly and equally divided into training, testing, and validation samples.


Exposures
Potential predictors (nâ€‰=â€‰268), including sociodemographics, health status, patterns of opioid use, and practitioner-level and regional-level factors, were measured in 3-month windows, starting 3 months before initiating opioids until loss of follow-up or the end of observation.


Main Outcomes and Measures
Opioid overdose episodes from inpatient and emergency department claims were identified. Multivariate logistic regression (MLR), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator-type regression (LASSO), random forest (RF), gradient boosting machine (GBM), and deep neural network (DNN) were applied to predict overdose risk in the subsequent 3 months after initiation of treatment with prescription opioids. Prediction performance was assessed using the C statistic and other metrics (eg, sensitivity, specificity, and number needed to evaluate [NNE] to identify one overdose). The Youden index was used to identify the optimized threshold of predicted score that balanced sensitivity and specificity.


Results
Beneficiaries in the training (nâ€‰=â€‰186â€¯686), testing (nâ€‰=â€‰186â€¯685), and validation (nâ€‰=â€‰186â€¯686) samples had similar characteristics (mean [SD] ageâ€‰ofâ€‰68.0â€‰[14.5] years, and approximately 63% were female, 82% were white, 35% had disabilities, 41% were dual eligible, and 0.60% had at least 1 overdose episode). In the validation sample, the DNN (C statisticâ€‰=â€‰0.91; 95% CI, 0.88-0.93) and GBM (C statisticâ€‰=â€‰0.90; 95% CI, 0.87-0.94) algorithms outperformed the LASSO (C statisticâ€‰=â€‰0.84; 95% CI, 0.80-0.89), RF (C statisticâ€‰=â€‰0.80; 95% CI, 0.75-0.84), and MLR (C statisticâ€‰=â€‰0.75; 95% CI, 0.69-0.80) methods for predicting opioid overdose. At the optimized sensitivity and specificity, DNN had a sensitivity of 92.3%, specificity of 75.7%, NNE of 542, positive predictive value of 0.18%, and negative predictive value of 99.9%. The DNN classified patients into low-risk (76.2% [142 180] of the cohort), medium-risk (18.6% [34 579] of the cohort), and high-risk (5.2% [9747] of the cohort) subgroups, with only 1 in 10â€¯000 in the low-risk subgroup having an overdose episode. More than 90% of overdose episodes occurred in the high-risk and medium-risk subgroups, although positive predictive values were low, given the rare overdose outcome.


Conclusions and Relevance
Machine-learning algorithms appear to perform well for risk prediction and stratification of opioid overdose, especially in identifying low-risk subgroups that have minimal risk of overdose.",2019,JAMA Network Open
"Hydrogen Maser Clocks in Space for Solid-Earth Research and Time-Transfer Applications: Experiment Overview and Evaluation of Russian Miniature Sapphire Loaded Cavity,","Abstract : The Observatoire Cantonal de Neuchatel (ON) is developing for ESTEC a compact H-maser for space use based upon a miniature sapphire loaded microwave cavity, a technique pioneered at VNIIFTRI. Various contacts between West-European parties, headed by ESA, and the Russian parties, headed by RSA, Led to the proposal for flying two H-masers on Meteor 3M, a Russian meteorology satellite in low polar orbit. The experiment will include two masers, one provided by ON and the other by VNIIFTRI. T/F transfer and precise positioning will be performed by both a microwave link, using PRARE equipment, and an optical link, using LASSO-like equipment. The main objectives of the experiment are precise orbit determination and point positioning for geodetic/geophysical research, ultra-accurate time comparison and dissemination as well as in-orbit demonstration of operation and performance of H-masers. Within the scope of a preliminary space H-maser development phase performed for ESTEC at ON in preparation to the joint experiment, a Russian miniature sapphire loaded microwave cavity, on Loan from VNIIFTRI, was evaluated in a full-size EFOS hydrogen maser built by ON. The experimental evaluation confirmed the theoretical expectation that with a hydrogen storage volume of only 0.6S liter an atomic quality factor of 1.5 x 109 can be obtained for a -105 dBm output power. This represents a theoretical Allan deviation of 1.7 x 10-15 averaged on a 1000 s time interval. From a full-size design to a compact one, therefore, the sacrifice in performance due to the reduction of the storage volume is very small.",1993,
ultrastructure of some Circumpolles,"AbstractOne form of Circumpolles described originates in the Airel quarry (France), which also yielded Classopollis harrisii Muir van Konijnenburg-van Cittert. Another form was sampled in the Turonian of Saint-Cirq (France) and corresponds to Classoidites glandis Amerom. The other three forms come from a sample of Triassic at Les Vans (France) in which the genera Circulina and Classopollis are found together.The exine structure of the first form is consistent with that of Classopollis torosus. The exine of Classoidites glandis contains two superimposable columellar levels, such as that of Classopollis, while the exine of Circulina shows only one granular level resting on the endexine of that which is called ectonexine. Thus a transition between this structure and that of Classopollis appears to exist.",1977,Grana
AbsorbanceMeasurementinCuvettesLyingLongitudinal to the LightBeam,"Measurement in cuvettes with their longitudinal dimension parallel to the light beam, while under the influence of a centrifugal force, has many advantages that are not immediately apparent. This survey summarizes the advantages in comparison to cuvettes standing with their long axis perpendicular to the light beam: in the latter the pathlength is fixed by the geometry, but if the cuvette is lying longitudinal to the light beam the pathlength is given by the filling volume. Because of the dependence of the pathlength on the filling (reaction) volume when cuvettes are lying longitudinal to the light beam, the calculation formulas show that the calculation factors, both for enzyme and substrate determination, become independent of the reagent volume form. This is demonstratedby simple equations and confirmed in practice by use of the (Cobas) Bio centrifugal analyzer in assays for glucose and aspartate aminotransferase. Additional Keyphrases: centrifugal analyzer (Cobas) Bio system spectrophotometry analytical systems Nowadays, most photometric determinations are done with use of a constant optical pathway, b, which is determined by the geometry of the cuvette and ordinarily is 1 cm. The precision of the light pathway for glassor quartz cuvettesis -0.01 mm for the usual dimensions of either 0.5 or 1 cm. The pathlength for disposable, less-expensive plastic cuvettes seems to be specified to only Â±0.05 mm. For studies in the microlitre and millilitre ranges,there are special cuvettes that are so constructed that smaller reaction volumes can be used,commonly still with a 1-cm pathlength. Special cuvettes are available for use in measurementsin the microliter range as well as in the milliliter range. In the method described here, absorbance is measured in cuvettes that are lying with the longitudinal dimension parallel to the light beam, a method that resemblesthe original Duboscg colorimetric method in that the optical pathlength can be varied by changing the filling volume. The larger the filling volume of the cuvette, the longer the optical pathlength for the light beam through the solution for which the absorbance is to be measured. Principle of Measurement",1979,
Multi-level features combined end-to-end learning for automated pathological grading of breast cancer on digital mammograms,We propose to discriminate the pathological grades directly on digital mammograms instead of pathological images. An end-to-end learning algorithm based on the combined multi-level features is proposed. Low-level features are extracted and selected by supervised LASSO logistic regression. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is designed to extract high-level semantic features. These extracted multi-level features are combined to optimize the new CNN end to end to make different parts of the network learn to pay attention to different level of features. Results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm is superior to other CNN models and obtain comparable performance compared with pathological images.,2019,Computerized medical imaging and graphics : the official journal of the Computerized Medical Imaging Society
Application of Multi-SNP Approaches Bayesian LASSO and AUC-RF to Detect Main Effects of Inflammatory-Gene Variants Associated with Bladder Cancer Risk,"The relationship between inflammation and cancer is well established in several tumor types, including bladder cancer. We performed an association study between 886 inflammatory-gene variants and bladder cancer risk in 1,047 cases and 988 controls from the Spanish Bladder Cancer (SBC)/EPICURO Study. A preliminary exploration with the widely used univariate logistic regression approach did not identify any significant SNP after correcting for multiple testing. We further applied two more comprehensive methods to capture the complexity of bladder cancer genetic susceptibility: Bayesian Threshold LASSO (BTL), a regularized regression method, and AUC-Random Forest, a machine-learning algorithm. Both approaches explore the joint effect of markers. BTL analysis identified a signature of 37 SNPs in 34 genes showing an association with bladder cancer. AUC-RF detected an optimal predictive subset of 56 SNPs. 13 SNPs were identified by both methods in the total population. Using resources from the Texas Bladder Cancer study we were able to replicate 30% of the SNPs assessed. The associations between inflammatory SNPs and bladder cancer were reexamined among non-smokers to eliminate the effect of tobacco, one of the strongest and most prevalent environmental risk factor for this tumor. A 9 SNP-signature was detected by BTL. Here we report, for the first time, a set of SNP in inflammatory genes jointly associated with bladder cancer risk. These results highlight the importance of the complex structure of genetic susceptibility associated with cancer risk.",2013,PLoS ONE
â€˜Prestation Economyâ€™: a model for Late Bronze Age and Early Iron Age burial deposition in Central-Western Europe,"Since the 1970â€™s, rich burials like those of Vix and Hochdorf have been analysed as the icons of a pan-regional phenomenon â€“ the emergence of traditional states, which is largely underpinned by the impact of their interaction with Mediterranean societies. However, during the last two decades, there has been significant criticism of such an interpretative model. In the core of such a debate, this paper argues that the archaeological record provides evidence that ritual deposits (likewise and alongside other forms of gift-giving) constituted a significant part of what I name as â€˜prestation economyâ€™. In order to demonstrate that, this paper analyses the burials and their grave-goods from the regions of four Furstensitze, namely: Bourges, ChÃ¢tillon-sur-GlÃ¢ne, Mont Lassois, and Hohenasperg.",2008,

"Fumonisin contamination of maize in Burkina Faso, West Africa","Maize throughout the world is frequently contaminated with a family of mycotoxins, the fumonisins, produced by species of Fusaria. The study investigated the level of fumonisin contamination of maize samples from village farms and large market traders in Burkina Faso, West Africa. Maize samples (5â€‰kg) from each of five to six large storage barns from farms in five villages in the district of Nâ€™Dorola, KÃ©nÃ©dougou province, western Burkina Faso, were sampled (nâ€‰=â€‰26) in Jan 1999 (>â€‰1 year storage), and a further 26 maize samples from the same farms were collected directly from the field in October 1999. In addition, 72 maize samples were obtained in July 1999 from large markets in Bobo Dioulasso. Fumonisins were extracted from dried maize, derivatized with o-phthaldialdehyde and quantified by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. All 26 samples from the first (mean 1170â€‰Î¼gâ€‰kgâˆ’1, range 110â€“3120â€‰Î¼gâ€‰kgâˆ’1) and from the second (mean 130â€‰Î¼gâ€‰kgâˆ’1, range 10â€“450â€‰Î¼gâ€‰kgâˆ’1) village collection were fumonisin positive. All 72 maize samples from the large markets were also positive for fumonisins, and had the highest levels of contamination (mean 2900â€‰Î¼gâ€‰kgâˆ’1, range 130â€“16â€‰040â€‰Î¼gâ€‰kgâˆ’1).

Sparse identification of posynomial models,"Posynomials are nonnegative combinations of monomials with possibly fractional and both positive and negative exponents. Posynomial models are widely used in various engineering design endeavors, such as circuits, aerospace and structural design, mainly due to the fact that design problems cast in terms of posynomial objectives and constraints can be solved efficiently by means of a convex optimization technique known as geometric programming (GP). However, while quite a vast literature exists on GP-based design, very few contributions can yet be found on the problem of identifying posynomial models from experimental data. Posynomial identification amounts to determining not only the coefficients of the combination, but also the exponents in the monomials, which renders the identification problem hard. In this paper, we propose an approach to the identification of multivariate posynomial models based on the expansion on a given large-scale basis of monomials. The model is then identified by seeking coefficients of the combination that minimize a mixed objective, composed by a term representing the fitting error and a term inducing sparsity in the representation, which results in a problem formulation of the ""square-root LASSO"" type, with nonnegativity constraints on the variables. We propose to solve the problem via a sequential coordinate-minimization scheme, which is suitable for large-scale implementations. A numerical example is finally presented, dealing with the identification of a posynomial model for a NACA 4412 airfoil.",2015,Autom.
Logistic Bayesian LASSO for Genetic Association Analysis of Data from Complex Sampling Designs,"Detecting geneâ€“environment interactions with rare variants is critical in dissecting the etiology of common diseases. Interactions with rare haplotype variants (rHTVs) are of particular interest. At the same time, complex sampling designs, such as stratified random sampling, are becoming increasingly popular for designing caseâ€“control studies, especially for recruiting controls. The US Kidney Cancer Study (KCS) is an example, wherein all available cases were included while the controls at each site were randomly selected from the population by frequency matching with cases based on age, sex and race. There is currently no rHTV association method that can account for such a complex sampling design. To fill this gap, we consider logistic Bayesian LASSO (LBL), an existing rHTV approach for caseâ€“control data, and show that its model can easily accommodate the complex sampling design. We study two extensions that include stratifying variables either as main effects only or with additional modeling of their interactions with haplotypes. We conduct extensive simulation studies to compare the complex sampling methods with the original LBL methods. We find that, when there is no interaction between haplotype and stratifying variables, both extensions perform well while the original LBL methods lead to inflated type I error rates. However, when such an interaction exists, it is necessary to include the interaction effect in the model to control the type I error rate. Finally, we analyze the KCS data and find a significant interaction between (current) smoking and a specific rHTV in the N-acetyltransferase 2 gene.",2017,Journal of human genetics
"When in Doubt, SWAP: High-Dimensional Sparse Recovery from Correlated Measurements","We consider the problem of accurately estimating a high-dimensional sparse vector using a small number of linear measurements that are contaminated by noise. It is well known that standard computationally tractable sparse recovery algorithms, such as the Lasso, OMP, and their various extensions, perform poorly when the measurement matrix contains highly correlated columns. We develop a simple greedy algorithm, called SWAP, that iteratively swaps variables until a desired loss function cannot be decreased any further. SWAP is surprisingly effective in handling measurement matrices with high correlations. We prove that SWAP can easily be used as a wrapper around standard sparse recovery algorithms for improved performance. We theoretically quantify the statistical guarantees of SWAP and complement our analysis with numerical results on synthetic and real data.",2013,
High-resolution geophysical characterization of shallow-water wetlands,"We describe a procedure for rapid characterization of shallow-water, contaminated wetlands.

Adjusted regularized estimation in the accelerated failure time model with high dimensional covariates,"Based on Stute's weighted least squares method, we consider the estimate procedures for the accelerated failure time (AFT) model with high dimensional covariates. We use Kaplan-Meier weights and Stute's estimator to account for censoring in least squares estimation. We consider two regularization approaches, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and minimax concave penalty (MCP) for estimation and variable selection in the AFT model. Our work includes the following contributions: (1) we adjust the penalty term in the objective function and show that this adjustment is crucial for the AFT model when the scales of covariates are heterogeneous; (2) with this adjustment, we also get a desired property for LASSO estimator in the AFT model, just like the uncensored case; (3) we replace a key assumption required in the high dimensional AFT model with a set of conditions which essentially require the fraction of censored data to be small; (4) we get selection consistency of MCP in the AFT model.",2013,J.

Sparse multipath channel estimation using ds algorithm in wideband communication systems,"Wideband wireless channel is a time dispersive channel and becomes strongly frequency-selective. However, in most cases, the channel is composed of a few dominant taps and a large part of taps is approximately zero or zero. They are often called sparse multi-path channels (MPC). Conventional linear MPC methods, such as the least squares (LS), do not exploit the sparsity of MPC. In general, accurate sparse MPC estimator can be obtained by solving a LASSO problem even in the presence of noise. In this paper, a novel CS-based sparse MPC method by using Dantzig selector (DS) [1] is introduced. This method exploits a channel's sparsity to reduce the number of training sequence and, hence, increase spectral efficiency when compared to existed methods with computer simulations.",2010,2010 3rd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing
Describing the fecal metabolome in cryogenically collected samples from healthy participants,"The chemical composition of feces plays an important role in human metabolism. Metabolomics and lipidomics are valuable tools for screening the metabolite composition in feces. Here we set out to describe fecal metabolite composition in healthy participants in frozen stools. Frozen stool samples were collected from 10 healthy volunteers and cryogenically drilled in four areas along the specimen. Polar metabolites were analyzed using derivatization followed by two-dimensional gas chromatography and time of flight mass spectrometry. Lipids were detected using ultra high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadruple time-of-flight mass spectrometry. 2326 metabolic features were detected. Out of a total of 298 metabolites that were annotated we report here 185 that showed a technical variation of xâ€‰<â€‰30%. These metabolites included amino acids, fatty acid derivatives, carboxylic acids and phenolic compounds. Lipids predominantly belonged to the groups of diacylglycerols, triacylglycerols and ceramides. Metabolites varied between sampling areas, some were broadly homogeneous, others varied 80%. A LASSO-computed network using metabolites present in all areas showed two main clusters describing the system, DAG lipids and phenyllactic acid. In feces from healthy participants, the main groups detected were phenolic compounds, ceramides, diacylglycerols and triacylglycerols.",2020,Scientific Reports
Neuro-current response functions: A unified approach to MEG source analysis under the continuous stimuli paradigm,"Characterizing the neural dynamics underlying sensory processing is one of the central areas of investigation in systems and cognitive neuroscience. Neuroimaging techniques such as magnetoencephalography (MEG) and Electroencephalography (EEG) have provided significant insights into the neural processing of continuous stimuli, such as speech, thanks to their high temporal resolution. Existing work in the context of auditory processing suggests that certain features of speech, such as the acoustic envelope, can be used as reliable linear predictors of the neural response manifested in M/EEG. The corresponding linear filters are referred to as temporal response functions (TRFs). While the functional roles of specific components of the TRF are well-studied and linked to behavioral attributes such as attention, the cortical origins of the underlying neural processes are not as well understood. In this work, we address this issue by estimating a linear filter representation of cortical sources directly from neuroimaging data in the context of continuous speech processing. To this end, we introduce Neuro-Current Response Functions (NCRFs), a set of linear filters, spatially distributed throughout the cortex, that predict the cortical currents giving rise to the observed ongoing MEG (or EEG) data in response to continuous speech. NCRF estimation is cast within a Bayesian framework, which allows unification of the TRF and source estimation problems, and also facilitates the incorporation of prior information on the structural properties of the NCRFs. To generalize this analysis to M/EEG recordings which lack individual structural magnetic resonance (MR) scans, NCRFs are extended to free-orientation dipoles and a novel regularizing scheme is put forward to lessen reliance on fine-tuned coordinate co-registration. We present a fast estimation algorithm, which we refer to as the Champ-Lasso algorithm, by leveraging recent advances in optimization, and demonstrate its utility through application to simulated and experimentally recorded MEG data under auditory experiments. Our simulation studies reveal significant improvements over existing methods that typically operate in a two-stage fashion, in terms of spatial resolution, response function reconstruction, and recovering dipole orientations. The analysis of experimentally-recorded MEG data without MR scans corroborates existing findings, but also delineates the distinct cortical distribution of the underlying neural processes at high spatiotemporal resolution. In summary, we provide a principled modeling and estimation paradigm for MEG source analysis tailored to extracting the cortical origin of electrophysiological responses to continuous stimuli.",2020,NeuroImage
Consistency and inconsistency in multispecies population network dynamics of coral reef ecosystems,"Different marine species and their larvae have characteristics that can expand or contract their potential dispersal, which can add complexity to the management of species assemblages. Here we used a multi-scale biophysical modeling framework, the Connectivity Modeling System, for the analysis of net- work connectivity for 5 Caribbean coral reef-associ- ated species in order to gauge similarities and dissimi- larities among species as well as among Caribbean regions. We estimated local dispersal and retention to assess regional exchanges, and our results revealed that the population structures of coral and fish are dif- ferent and should thus have dissimilar management requirements in many regions, with some notable ex- ceptions. Populations of Porites astreoides corals ap- pear fragmented, suggesting that loss of adult colonies in any region may significantly impact regional re- cruitment success and connectivity. At the other end of the spectrum, populations of bluehead wrasse Tha- lassoma bifasciatum are highly connected, and re- moval of adults in any single region would not imply future recruitment failure in that region. We suggest using a 'diversity of exogenous settlement' index as a proxy of recolonization potential, which is related to the stability of regional connectivity networks. We demonstrate that resolving multispecies larval trans- port dynamics helps identify regions of both network stability for multi-generational connectivity (e.g. sta- ble larval sources and corridors) pertinent to regional- level management and network inconsistencies among species which are pertinent to the success of local management.

Boosting the discriminatory power of sparse survival models via optimization of the concordance index and stability selection,"BackgroundWhen constructing new biomarker or gene signature scores for time-to-event outcomes, the underlying aims are to develop a discrimination model that helps to predict whether patients have a poor or good prognosis and to identify the most influential variables for this task. In practice, this is often done fitting Cox models. Those are, however, not necessarily optimal with respect to the resulting discriminatory power and are based on restrictive assumptions. We present a combined approach to automatically select and fit sparse discrimination models for potentially high-dimensional survival data based on boosting a smooth version of the concordance index (C-index). Due to this objective function, the resulting prediction models are optimal with respect to their ability to discriminate between patients with longer and shorter survival times. The gradient boosting algorithm is combined with the stability selection approach to enhance and control its variable selection properties.ResultsThe resulting algorithm fits prediction models based on the rankings of the survival times and automatically selects only the most stable predictors. The performance of the approach, which works best for small numbers of informative predictors, is demonstrated in a large scale simulation study: C-index boosting in combination with stability selection is able to identify a small subset of informative predictors from a much larger set of non-informative ones while controlling the per-family error rate. In an application to discover biomarkers for breast cancer patients based on gene expression data, stability selection yielded sparser models and the resulting discriminatory power was higher than with lasso penalized Cox regression models.ConclusionThe combination of stability selection and C-index boosting can be used to select small numbers of informative biomarkers and to derive new prediction rules that are optimal with respect to their discriminatory power. Stability selection controls the per-family error rate which makes the new approach also appealing from an inferential point of view, as it provides an alternative to classical hypothesis tests for single predictor effects. Due to the shrinkage and variable selection properties of statistical boosting algorithms, the latter tests are typically unfeasible for prediction models fitted by boosting.",2016,BMC Bioinformatics
"A Flexible, Scalable and Efficient Algorithmic Framework for Primal Graphical Lasso","We propose a scalable, efficient and statistically motivated computational framework for Graphical Lasso (Friedman et al., 2007b) - a covariance regularization framework that has received significant attention in the statistics community over the past few years. Existing algorithms have trouble in scaling to dimensions larger than a thousand. Our proposal significantly enhances the state-of-the-art for such moderate sized problems and gracefully scales to larger problems where other algorithms become practically infeasible. This requires a few key new ideas. We operate on the primal problem and use a subtle variation of block-coordinate-methods which drastically reduces the computational complexity by orders of magnitude. We provide rigorous theoretical guarantees on the convergence and complexity of our algorithm and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal via experiments. We believe that our framework extends the applicability of Graphical Lasso to large-scale modern applications like bioinformatics, collaborative filtering and social networks, among others.",2011,arXiv: Machine Learning

Scalable Stochastic Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers,"Stochastic alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), which visits only one sample or a mini-batch of samples each time, has recently been proved to achieve better performance than batch ADMM. However, most stochastic methods can only achieve a convergence rate $O(1/\sqrt T)$ on general convex problems,where T is the number of iterations. Hence, these methods are not scalable with respect to convergence rate (computation cost). There exists only one stochastic method, called SA-ADMM, which can achieve convergence rate $O(1/T)$ on general convex problems. However, an extra memory is needed for SA-ADMM to store the historic gradients on all samples, and thus it is not scalable with respect to storage cost. In this paper, we propose a novel method, called scalable stochastic ADMM(SCAS-ADMM), for large-scale optimization and learning problems. Without the need to store the historic gradients, SCAS-ADMM can achieve the same convergence rate $O(1/T)$ as the best stochastic method SA-ADMM and batch ADMM on general convex problems. Experiments on graph-guided fused lasso show that SCAS-ADMM can achieve state-of-the-art performance in real applications",2015,ArXiv
"Series of Highly Luminescent Macrocyclic Sm(III) Complexes: Functional Group Modifications Together with Luminescence Performances in Solid-State, Solution, and Doped Poly(methylmethacrylate) Film","Here, we report our trials to regulate the luminescence performance of the macrocyclic samarium(III) complex and prepare four excellent luminescent Sm(III) complex-doped poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) composites. Four 23-membered [1 + 1] Schiff-base macrocyclic mononuclear Sm(III) complexes, Sm-2 a -Sm-2 d , originating from dialdehydes with different pendant arms and 1,2-bis(2-aminoethoxy)ethane, have been constructed by the template method. Crystal structures reveal that every Sm(III) ion with the coordination geometry of a distorted bicapped square antiprism is capsulated by the macrocyclic cavity environment forming the ""lasso-type"" protection. Relative photophysical properties of macrocyclic Sm(III) complexes are carefully investigated in solid-state, methanol solution, and doped PMMA film, and all these show characteristic emissions of the Sm(III) ion associated with satisfactory lifetimes and quantum yields in all media, which could be comparable to reported outstanding examples. Especially, the luminescence performance for this type of Sm(III) complex could be regulated in the solid state by the use of different functional groups in the pendant arm while it is not achieved in solution and the doped PMMA composite. High emitting and air-stable plastic materials could be obtained when these Sm(III) complexes are doped in PMMA with 0.1 wt % mixing ratio, and the corresponding maximum lifetime and quantum yield are 61.2 Î¼s and 0.63% in the case of complex Sm-2 a , respectively. We believe that these highly luminescent ""lasso-type"" Sm(III) complexes and doped PMMA composites are valuable references in the design of luminescent lanthanide(III) hybrid materials.",2019,ACS Omega

"Klassifizierung mariner, brackiger und limnischer Grundwasserbiotope","The oligohaline groundwater of marine beaches (â€žKÃ¼stengrundwasserâ€œ;Remane) represents an ecological zone of contact between limnic and marine groundwater biotopes. In the â€žKÃ¼stengrundwasserâ€œ and in all other brackish, marine and limnic interstitial waters there are two principal ecological factors: darkness and dimension of interstitial volume. These ecological conditions suggest a comprehensive classification of limnic, brackish and marine groundwater biotopes (except saline subterranean inland waters). Freshwater subterranean biotopes are classified in regard to the nature of the substrate containing groundwater, and the nature of contact with surface waters. The classification of subterranean biotopes influenced by marine conditions is based on the same factors plus salinity of the interstitial water. The â€œVenice systemâ€ for classification of brackish water is considered to be of limited value. In general, brackish subterranean waters should only be classified as: oligohaline, mesohaline or polyhaline thalassopsammal. The usefulness of the â€œVenice systemâ€ classification is limited to marine-influenced groundwater biotopes with an extremely stable salinity.Zusammenfassung1.

A Note on the Lasso and Related Procedures in Model Selection,"The Lasso, the Forward Stagewise regression and the Lars are closely related procedures recently proposed for linear regression problems. Each of them can produce sparse models and can be used both for estimation and variable selec- tion. In practical implementations these algorithms are typically tuned to achieve optimal prediction accuracy. We show that, when the prediction accuracy is used as the criterion to choose the tuning parameter, in general these procedures are not consistent in terms of variable selection. That is, the sets of variables selected are not consistently the true set of important variables. In particular, we show that for any sample size n, when there are superuous variables in the linear regression model and the design matrix is orthogonal, the probability that these procedures correctly identify the true set of important variables is less than a constant (smaller than one) not depending on n. This result is also shown to hold for two-dimensional problems with general correlated design matrices. The results indicate that in prob- lems where the main goal is variable selection, prediction-accuracy-based criteria alone are not sucien t for this purpose. Adjustments will be discussed to make the Lasso and related procedures useful/consistent for variable selection.",2006,

A Novel Triage Tool of Artificial Intelligence Assisted Diagnosis Aid System for Suspected COVID-19 pneumonia In Fever Clinics,"Currently, the prevention and control of COVID-19 outside Hubei province in China, and other countries has become more and more critically serious. We developed and validated a diagnosis aid model without CT images for early identification of suspected COVID-19 pneumonia (S-COVID-19-P) on admission in adult fever patients and made the validated model available via an online triage calculator. Patients admitted from Jan 14 to Feb 26, 2020 with the epidemiological history of exposure to COVID-19 were included [Model development (n = 132) and validation (n = 32)]. Candidate features included clinical symptoms, routine laboratory tests and other clinical information on admission. Features selection and model development were based on Lasso regression. The primary outcome is the development and validation of a diagnosis aid model for S-COVID-19-P early identification on admission. The development cohort contains 26 S-COVID-19-P and 7 confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia cases. The model performance in held-out testing set and validation cohort resulted in AUCs of 0.841 and 0.938, F-1 score of 0.571 and 0.667, recall of 1.000 and 1.000, specificity of 0.727 and 0.778, and the precision of 0.400 and 0.500. Based on this model, an optimized strategy for S-COVID-19-P early identification in fever clinics has also been designed. S-COVID-19-P could be identified early by a machine-learning model only used collected clinical information without CT images on admission in fever clinics with 100% recall score. The well performed and validated model has been deployed as an online triage tool, which is available at: https://intensivecare.shinyapps.io/COVID19/.",2020,

Estimation of high dimensional mean regression in the absence of symmetry and light tail assumptions.,"Data subject to heavy-tailed errors are commonly encountered in various scientific fields. To address this problem, procedures based on quantile regression and Least Absolute Deviation (LAD) regression have been developed in recent years. These methods essentially estimate the conditional median (or quantile) function. They can be very different from the conditional mean functions, especially when distributions are asymmetric and heteroscedastic. How can we efficiently estimate the mean regression functions in ultra-high dimensional setting with existence of only the second moment? To solve this problem, we propose a penalized Huber loss with diverging parameter to reduce biases created by the traditional Huber loss. Such a penalized robust approximate quadratic (RA-quadratic) loss will be called RA-Lasso. In the ultra-high dimensional setting, where the dimensionality can grow exponentially with the sample size, our results reveal that the RA-lasso estimator produces a consistent estimator at the same rate as the optimal rate under the light-tail situation. We further study the computational convergence of RA-Lasso and show that the composite gradient descent algorithm indeed produces a solution that admits the same optimal rate after sufficient iterations. As a byproduct, we also establish the concentration inequality for estimating population mean when there exists only the second moment. We compare RA-Lasso with other regularized robust estimators based on quantile regression and LAD regression. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate the satisfactory finite-sample performance of RA-Lasso.",2017,"Journal of the Royal Statistical Society. Series B, Statistical methodology"
Predictors of 24-h mortality after inter-hospital transfer to a tertiary medical intensive care unit,"Purpose To identify variables associated with 24-h mortality after inter-hospital transfer. Materials and methods Single center retrospective study of adult patients transferred to a tertiary care medical ICU between 1 January 2010 and 15 April 2014. Demographic, clinical, physiologic, and laboratory data were collected. The Lasso method was used for logistic regression to identify predictors of 24-h mortality after inter-hospital ICU transfer. Results We identified 773 patients. Median age was 58 years (IQR 45â€“69), 49% were female, 83% Caucasian, and 48% had Medicare. The median length of stay at the transferring facility was 1.0 day (IQR 0â€“2). Median SOFA score on the day of ICU transfer was 5 (IQR 2â€“8). Twenty-two (3%) died within 24â€‰h after inter-hospital transfer. SOFA score of 12â€“16 the day of inter-hospital transfer (odds ratio (OR) 7.77, 95% CI 1.21â€“66.26, pâ€‰=â€‰0.037), FiO2 0.8â€“1.0 on ICU arrival, and cardiac arrest prior to transfer (OR 4.94, 95% CI 1.43â€“15.96, pâ€‰=â€‰0.009) were associated with an increased risk for 24-h mortality after inter-hospital transfer.

Integrating manual diagnosis into radiomics for reducing the false positive rate of 18F-FDG PET/CT diagnosis in patients with suspected lung cancer,"PurposeThe high false positive rate (FPR) of 18F-FDG PET/CT in lung cancer screening represents a severe challenge for clinical decision-making. This study aimed to develop a clinical-translatable radiomics nomogram for reducing the FPR of PET/CT in lung cancer diagnosis, and to determine the impact of integrating manual diagnosis to the performance of the radiomics nomogram.MethodsAmong 3,947 18F-FDG PET/CT-screened patients with lung lesion, 157 malignant and 111 benign patients were retrospectively enrolled and divided into training and test cohorts. The data of manual diagnosis were recorded. A total of 4,338 features were extracted from CT, thin-section CT, PET and PET/CT, and the four radiomics signatures (RS) were then generated by LASSO method. Radiomics prediction nomogram integrating imaging-based RS and manual diagnosis was developed using multivariable logistic regression. The performances of RS and prediction nomograms were independently validated through key discrimination index and clinical benefit.ResultsThe FPR of manual diagnosis was found to be 30.6%. Among the four RS, PET/CT RS exhibited the best performance. By integrating manual diagnosis, the hybrid nomogram integrating PET/CT RS and manual diagnosis demonstrated lowest FPR and highest area under curve (AUC) and Youden index (YI) in both training and test cohorts (FPR: 5.4% and 9.1%, AUC: 0.98 and 0.92, YI: 85.8% and 75.5%, respectively). This hybrid nomogram respectively corrected 78.6% and 37.5% among FPR cases produced by PET/CT RS, without significantly sacrificing its sensitivity. The net benefit of hybrid nomogram appeared highest at <85% threshold probability.ConclusionThe established hybrid nomogram integrating PET/CT RS and manual diagnosis can significantly reduce FPR, improve diagnostic accuracy and enhance clinical benefit compared to manual diagnosis. By integrating manual diagnosis, the performance of this hybrid nomogram is superior to PET/CT RS, indicating the importance of cliniciansâ€™ judgement as an essential information source for improving radiomics diagnostic approaches.",2019,European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging
"Erectile Dysfunction among Diabetic Men in Two Medical Centers in Burkina Faso: Epidemiological, Diagnosis and Therapeutic Aspects","Objective: To study erectile dysfunction in diabetic patients seen in two clinics in the city of Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso. Materials and Methods: A prospective cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted at the Souro Sanou Teaching Hospital (CHUSS) and the Saint Leopold clinic in Bobo-Dioulasso, from March 1 to September 1, 2012. A total of 107 patients data were collated and analysed, which was then grouped into two: the ED group, designating patients with erectile dysfunction and the NED group consisting of those patients without. The sample comprised of 61 patients with types 1 and 2 diabetesand were aged between 25-70 years. The IIEF-5 was used to evaluate erectile dysfunction. Results: The prevalence of erectile dysfunction was 57%. The average age of patients was 54.4 Â± 8.3 years. All patients with ED had type 2 diabetes. The mean disease duration of diabetes was 7.2 Â± 6 years. Erectile dysfunction was severe in 32.8% of cases, moderate in 31.1% of cases and mild in 36.1%. Its severity was significantly associated with glycated hemoglobin, triglycerides and BMI. Phosphodiesterase types 5 (PDE5) inhibitors were found to be effective in the treatment of erectile dysfunction with a satisfactory therapeutic response in 77.4% of users. Conclusion: Erectile dysfunction is a common complication in diabetic patients. Its occurrence and severity are influenced by several factors. The potential presence of this disorder should be assessed due to its negative impact on quality of life. Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors are an effective treatment modality in diabetic patients.",2014,

Para serem alcancados esses resultados, utiliza-se como metodologia os aportes teoricos do novo realismo especulativo de Quentin Meillassoux, de modo a explicitar o correlacionismo presente na hermeneutica constitucional brasileira e apresentar uma nova perspectiva de discussao sobre o problema do referente juridico. Como resultado, conclui-se que o problema da hermeneutica constitucional pode ser compreendido nao apenas como um problema de indeterminacao da linguagem â€œabertaâ€ dos principios constitucionais, tampouco como um problema de interpretacao subjetivista do juiz, mas tambem como um problema inscrito nas relacoes de poder entre as instituicoes juridicas (judiciario, advocacia publica, advocacia privada e academia) pela ocupacao dos espacos de producao de sentido do direito. Palavras-chave : Hermeneutica constitucional. Interpretacao juridica. Correlacionismo. Pluralismo juridico. Difference . Abstract : This researchÂ aimedÂ to establish a critical reflection about the problem of the commitment of the constitutional interpretation by the STF (Brazilian Supreme Court) with the traditional referents of the Law. Starting from a rereading of the Kelsenian problem of the indeterminacy of language, we want to present the problem of the referent to the discussion, that is, the problem of the discretionary choice not only of the semiological relation between meaning and significant, which is the problem of judicial decisionism, but the problem of the arbitrary choice of the symbolic system that constitutes the interpretative reference of the judicial decision in each case. Our hypothesis is that the manner of constitutional interpretation by STF is characterized by a semantic externalism typical of the Difference paradigm. In order to achieve these results, will be used as methodology the theoretical contributions of the new speculative realism by Quentin Meillassoux, in order to make explicit theÂ co-relationism present in the Brazilian constitutional hermeneutics and present a new perspective of discussion on the problem of the legal referent. As a result, we find that the problem of constitutional hermeneutics can be understood not only as a problem of indetermination by ""open"" language of constitutional principles, either as a problem of subjectivist interpretation by judges, but also as a problem inscribed in the power relations between legal institutions (judiciary,Â public defender, privateÂ advocacyÂ and academy) for the occupation of the spaces of production of law meaning.

Spatial Dispersion and Nonmigratory Spawning in the Bluehead Wrasse ( Thalassoma bifasciatum ),"Earlier studies of the behavior of the bluehead wrasse Thalassoma bifasciatum have shown it to be a migratory spawner with large terminal-phase males defending temporary spawning territories. We describe a variant social structure where fish occupy permanent home ranges, spawn within or near these home ranges, and are not territorial. Movements of identified terminal-phase and intermediate males and females were mapped in the backreef areas of three coral reefs in Puerto Rico. Locations of spawns were then compared with these home-range maps. All fish used most o r all of their morning home range during the afternoon spawning period. Both terminal-phase males and females spawned within or near their home ranges. Males were relatively tolerant of other males during the afternoon spawning period: only one in five encounters between large males resulted in aggressive chases. The location of chases bore no relation to spawning sites, areas of morning foraging, o r to home-range borders. A Monte Carlo computer simulation was used to measure home-range dispersion of terminal-phase and intermediate males at our main site. If males were territorial, we should expect their home ranges to be significantly overdispersed within the cumulative area they occupied. During the first year male home ranges were overdispersed but during the second year they were randomly dispersed, even though the same number of terminal-phase males occupied the same study site both years. Differences in social behavior between backreef areas and other areas reported in the literature, and found in other portions of our reefs, may be related to differences in feeding ecology between populations and between different portions of the same reef.

A compact and accurate semi-global potential energy surface for malonaldehyde from constrained least squares regression.,"We present a new approach to semi-global potential energy surface fitting that uses the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) constrained least squares procedure to exploit an extremely flexible form for the potential function, while at the same time controlling the risk of overfitting and avoiding the introduction of unphysical features such as divergences or high-frequency oscillations. Drawing from a massively redundant set of overlapping distributed multi-dimensional Gaussian functions of inter-atomic separations we build a compact full-dimensional surface for malonaldehyde, fit to explicitly correlated coupled cluster CCSD(T)(F12*) energies with a root mean square deviations accuracy of 0.3%-0.5% up to 25,000 cm(-1) above equilibrium. Importance-sampled diffusion Monte Carlo calculations predict zero point energies for malonaldehyde and its deuterated isotopologue of 14â€‰715.4(2) and 13â€‰997.9(2) cm(-1) and hydrogen transfer tunnelling splittings of 21.0(4) and 3.2(4) cm(-1), respectively, which are in excellent agreement with the experimental values of 21.583 and 2.915(4) cm(-1).",2014,The Journal of chemical physics

Materials and Methods: We re-annotated RNA sequencing and obtained exhaustive RNA-seq data of 269 patients with comprehensive clinical information from the GEO database. Then an 8-lncRNA signature capable of predicting the survival prognosis of HNSCC patients and a nomogram containing this signature were established. Weighted Co-expression Network Construction (WGCNA), Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment were then applied to predict the possible biological functions of the signature and each individual lncRNA. Results: Eight lncRNAs associated with survival in HNSCC patients, including AC010624.1, AC130456.4, LINC00608, LINC01300, MIR99AHG, AC008655.1, AC055758.2, and AC118553.1, were obtained by univariate regression, cox LASSO regression, and multivariate regression. Functionally, patients with high signature scores had abnormal immune functions via GSEA. AC010624.1 and AC130456.4 may participate in epidermal cell differentiation and skin development, and MIR99AHG in the formation of cellular structures. Other lncRNAs in the signature may also participate in important biological processes. Conclusions: Therefore, we established an 8-lncRNA signature that can effectively guide clinical prediction of the prognosis of patients with HNSCC, and individuals with high signature scores may have abnormal immune function.",2019,Frontiers in Oncology

Regularized calibrated estimation of propensity scores with model misspecification and high-dimensional data,"Propensity score methods are widely used for estimating treatment effects from observational studies. A popular approach is to estimate propensity scores by maximum likelihood based on logistic regression, and then apply inverse probability weighted estimators or extensions to estimate treatment effects. However, a challenging issue is that such inverse probability weighting methods including doubly robust methods can perform poorly even when the logistic model appears adequate as examined by conventional techniques. In addition, there is increasing difficulty to appropriately estimate propensity scores when dealing with a large number of covariates. To address these issues, we study calibrated estimation as an alternative to maximum likelihood estimation for fitting logistic propensity score models. We show that, with possible model misspecification, minimizing the expected calibration loss underlying the calibrated estimators involves reducing both the expected likelihood loss and a measure of relative errors which controls the mean squared errors of inverse probability weighted estimators. Furthermore, we propose a regularized calibrated estimator by minimizing the calibration loss with a Lasso penalty. We develop a novel Fisher scoring descent algorithm for computing the proposed estimator, and provide a high-dimensional analysis of the resulting inverse probability weighted estimators of population means, leveraging the control of relative errors for calibrated estimation. We present a simulation study and an empirical application to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed methods compared with maximum likelihood and regularization.",2017,arXiv: Methodology
Fetal weight estimation by ultrasound: development of Indian population-based models,"PURPOSE
Existing ultrasound-based fetal weight estimation models have been shown to have high errors when used in the Indian population. Therefore, the primary objective of this study was to develop Indian population-based models for fetal weight estimation, and the secondary objective was to compare their performance against established models.


METHODS
Retrospectively collected data from 173 cases were used in this study. The inclusion criteria were a live singleton pregnancy and an interval from the ultrasound scan to delivery of â‰¤7 days. Multiple stepwise regression (MSR) and lasso regression methods were used to derive fetal weight estimation models using a randomly selected training group (n=137) with cross-products of abdominal circumference (AC), biparietal diameter (BPD), head circumference (HC), and femur length (FL) as independent variables. In the validation group (n=36), the bootstrap method was used to compare the performance of the new models against 12 existing models.


RESULTS
The equations for the best-fit models obtained using the MSR and lasso methods were as follows: log10(EFW)=2.7843700+0.0004197(HCÃ—AC)+0.0008545(ACÃ—FL) and log10(EFW)=2.38 70211110+0.0074323216(HC)+0.0186555940(AC)+0.0013463735(BPDÃ—FL)+0.0004519715 (HCÃ—FL), respectively. In the training group, both models had very low systematic errors of 0.01% (Â±7.74%) and -0.03% (Â±7.70%), respectively. In the validation group, the performance of these models was found to be significantly better than that of the existing models.


CONCLUSION
The models presented in this study were found to be superior to existing models of ultrasound-based fetal weight estimation in the Indian population. We recommend a thorough evaluation of these models in independent studies.",2019,Ultrasonography
DASSO: connections between the Dantzig selector and lasso,"We propose a new algorithm, DASSO, for fitting the entire coefficient path of the Dantzig selector with a similar computational cost to the least angle regression algorithm that is used to compute the lasso. DASSO efficiently constructs a piecewise linear path through a sequential simplex-like algorithm, which is remarkably similar to the least angle regression algorithm. Comparison of the two algorithms sheds new light on the question of how the lasso and Dantzig selector are related. In addition, we provide theoretical conditions on the design matrix ""X"" under which the lasso and Dantzig selector coefficient estimates will be identical for certain tuning parameters. As a consequence, in many instances, we can extend the powerful non-asymptotic bounds that have been developed for the Dantzig selector to the lasso. Finally, through empirical studies of simulated and real world data sets we show that in practice, when the bounds hold for the Dantzig selector, they almost always also hold for the lasso.

RSPIRIT: Robust self-consistent parallel imaging reconstruction based on generalized Lasso,"In this paper, we propose a novel approach called robust iterative self-consistent parallel imaging reconstruction (RSPIRiT) in parallel magnetic resonance imaging (pMRI). Different from the smooth Tikhonov regularization used in SPIRiT, our model utilizes generalized Lasso to fix calibration errors in the reconstruction process. It results in a non-smooth optimization problem, which we introduce a new primal-dual pMRI algorithm to solve. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, compared to state-of-the-art methods.",2016,2016 IEEE 13th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI)
Pre-school teachers' ability to detect speech and language disorders,"Introduction â™¦ Speech and language disorder is the abnormal acquisition of spoken or written language in one or some of the components of the linguistic system (phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics) (ASHA, 1980). â™¦ The early identification of speech and language disorders leads to early intervention and improves the child's long-term prognosis and academic achievement (Nelson et al., 2006, Vlassopoulos et al., 1994, Bliss et al., 1984). â™¦ Screening as a process is intended to separate out the children who need further investigation of their language skills from those with normally developing speech and language. In doing this a screening procedure classifies children as â€˜possibly abnormalâ€™ or â€˜possibly normalâ€™ (Law et al., 1998). â™¦ In Greece screening for speech and language difficulties is not widely available in public schools and kindergartens. Furthermore, there is only one standardized tool for this purpose, the AnOmiLo4 (2003). â™¦ Recent studies discuss the importance of pre-school teachers' role in early detection of speech and language disorders (ASHA, 1991, Law et al., 1998, Maas, W., 1999, Nelson et al., 2006).",2009,
Comparison of Different Classification Methods for Analyzing Electronic Nose Data to Characterize Sesame Oils and Blends,"An electronic nose (e-nose) was used to characterize sesame oils processed by three different methods (hot-pressed, cold-pressed, and refined), as well as blends of the sesame oils and soybean oil. Seven classification and prediction methods, namely PCA, LDA, PLS, KNN, SVM, LASSO and RF, were used to analyze the e-nose data. The classification accuracy and MAUC were employed to evaluate the performance of these methods. The results indicated that sesame oils processed with different methods resulted in different sensor responses, with cold-pressed sesame oil producing the strongest sensor signals, followed by the hot-pressed sesame oil. The blends of pressed sesame oils with refined sesame oil were more difficult to be distinguished than the blends of pressed sesame oils and refined soybean oil. LDA, KNN, and SVM outperformed the other classification methods in distinguishing sesame oil blends. KNN, LASSO, PLS, and SVM (with linear kernel), and RF models could adequately predict the adulteration level (% of added soybean oil) in the sesame oil blends. Among the prediction models, KNN with k = 1 and 2 yielded the best prediction results.",2015,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)"
Identification of TP53 mutation associated-immunotype and prediction of survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Background
Stratification of tumors is necessary to achieve better clinical outcomes. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is commonly associated with mutation of the TP53 gene and heterogeneity in immune cell content. However, TP53 mutation-associated immunotype of HCC has not been reported yet. This study aimed to identify the TP53 mutation-associated immunotype in HCC.


Methods
The mutation annotation format (MAF) document, mRNA expression data, and clinical data of HCC patients were downloaded from the publicly available The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data portal. Data from 332 HCC patients were analyzed in this study. Infiltrating immune cells were evaluated by the well-known CIBERSORT method. Additional mutation data of HCC patients were downloaded from the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) database.


Results
The TP53 gene harbored the highest frequency of mutations in HCC patients. Consequently, five lethal features, including TP53 mutations, were screened by least absolute shrinkage and selector operation (LASSO)-COX regression, according to TP53 mutations and 22 infiltrating immune cells. Two distinct subgroups of HCC were identified, namely, immunotypes A and B. Furthermore, the expression levels of co-inhibitory immune checkpoints were significantly upregulated, and the gene ontology (GO) terms or pathways to boost immune responses were found to be inhibited in the immunotype B subgroup compared to that in the immunotype A subgroup. Finally, we proved immunotype to be an independent adverse prognostic factor that contributed to improvement in the predictive accuracy of the immunotype-based model and helped in avoiding excessive medical treatment.


Conclusions
Two distinct immunotypes of HCC, in terms of prognosis, phenotype, and function, were identified and the traditional understanding of intratumoralCD8+ T cells was subverted. Moreover, the identified immunotypes contributed to improving the predictive accuracy of the immunotype-based model and helped in avoiding excessive medical treatment in some HCC patients.",2020,Annals of translational medicine

Sparse Overlapping Group Lasso for Integrative Multi-Omics Analysis,"Gene networks and graphs are crucial tools for understanding a heterogeneous system of cancer, since cancer is a disease that does not involve individual genes but combinations of genes associated with oncogenic process. A goal of genomic data analysis via gene networks is to identify both gene networks and individual genes within the selected networks. Existing methods, however, perform only network selection, and thus all genes in selected networks are included in models. This leads to overfitting when uncovering driver genes, and the results are not biologically interpretable. To accomplish both ""groupwise sparsity"" and ""within group sparsity"" for identifying driver genes based on biological knowledge (i.e., predefined overlapping groups of features), we propose a sparse overlapping group lasso via duplicated predictors in extended space. The proposed method effectively identifies driver genes and their interactions using known biological pathway information. Monte Carlo simulations and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project data analysis indicate that the proposed method is effective for fitting a regression model (i.e., feature selection and prediction accuracy) constructed with duplicated predictors in overlapping groups. In the TCGA data analysis, we uncover potential cancer driver genes via expression modules and gene networks constructed by multi-omics data and identify that the uncovered genes have strong evidences as a cancer driver gene. The proposed method is a useful tool for identifying cancer driver genes and for integrative multi-omics analysis.",2015,Journal of computational biology : a journal of computational molecular cell biology
Algorithm with Applications to Sparse Signal Reconstruction,"Sparse models are a class of systems in which prior knowledge indicates the presence of a majority of zero valued parameters in a model but not the location of the zeros in the parameter vector [1, 2, 3]. Such models occur in a wide range of applications [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 3]. Many algorithms have been developed for estimating the location of the null parameters. Well known algorithms include, LASSO and Dantzig [9, 10]. These can be thought of as providing a form of regularization. It has been shown that, under appropriate conditions, these algorithms can find the correct location of the null parameters. Another algorithm that has been widely used for sparse estimation problems is the MUSIC algorithm [11]. This algorithm was originally developed for multiple emitter locations in signal processing [11, 12]. It has also been applied to other sparse problems including blind multiband signal reconstruction [13, 3]. All of the algorithms mentioned above are â€œoff-lineâ€ in the sense that one first collects a large set of data and then one applies the algorithm. However, in some applications, e.g. cognitive radio, it would be helpful if one could have an â€œonlineâ€ version of the algorithm in which the estimates of the sparse model evolves as the data is collected. Thus, at any given time, one has an estimate of the sparse model.",2012,
"Novel and Unexpected Prokaryotic Diversity in Water and Sediments of the Alkaline, Hypersaline Lakes of the Wadi An Natrun, Egypt","The phylogenetic diversity of the bacterial and archaeal community in the water and sediments of three large lakes of the Wadi An Natrun was investigated using 16S rRNA clone libraries. The bacterial community was diverse: 769 clones formed 345 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) defined at 99% 16S rRNA sequence identity. The bacterial community in both the water and sediments of the lakes was dominated by clones affiliated with the low Gâ€‰+â€‰C Gram-type-positive group, Î±-proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes, (11â€“39, 11â€“30, and 10â€“37% of OTUs observed, respectively), patterns that have been observed in previously described alkaline, athalassohaline systems. However, a relatively high proportion of Firmicutess-related clones in the water of the lakes and Î±-proteobacteria in the sediments was observed. The bacterial community composition of the water and sediment of the same lake and of different lakes was significantly different (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). Operational taxonomic units related to the Î³-proteobacteria were more abundant in the sediment of Lake Fazda, whereas the sediment of Lake UmRisha was dominated by members of the Î´-proteobacteria. The proportion of Î³-proteobacterial and Bacteroidetes-affiliated OTUs were predominant in the water of Lake UmRisha and differed significantly from other lake waters (chi-squared analysis, pâ€‰â‰¤â€‰0.01). The more oxygenated and dilute nature of Lake Hamra was reflected in its microbial community composition, with the abundance of Bacillales sequences in the water, the absence of Halanaerobiales, Clostridiales, and Archaea in the water, and the presence of representatives of more phyla such as the Actinobacteria, Spirochaetes, and Verrucomicrobia. The archaeal community composition appeared less diverse: 589 clones resulted in 198 OTUs defined at 99% 16S rRNA sequence identity, and all sequences fell into the phylum Euryarchaeota. Phylogenetic analysis showed that many of the sequences were distantly related (83â€“90% 16S rRNA sequence identity) to cultured and uncultured archaea, with many clones forming clusters that branched deeply within the Euryarchaeota. Forty-two and 53% of the bacterial and archaeal clones had less than 90% 16S rRNA sequence identity to previously described sequences. This indicates that the water and sediments of the Wadi An Natrun harbor a unique and novel prokaryotic diversity that is different from what has been described among other alkaline, athalassohaline lakes.",2006,Microbial Ecology

Subject-specific abnormal region detection in traumatic brain injury using sparse model selection on high dimensional diffusion data,"We present a method to estimate a multivariate Gaussian distribution of diffusion tensor features in a set of brain regions based on a small sample of healthy individuals, and use this distribution to identify imaging abnormalities in subjects with mild traumatic brain injury. The multivariate model receives apriori knowledge in the form of a neighborhood graph imposed on the precision matrix, which models brain region interactions, and an additional L1 sparsity constraint. The model is then estimated using the graphical LASSO algorithm and the Mahalanobis distance of healthy and TBI subjects to the distribution mean is used to evaluate the discriminatory power of the model. Our experiments show that the addition of the apriori neighborhood graph results in significant improvements in classification performance compared to a model which does not take into account the brain region interactions or one which uses a fully connected prior graph. In addition, we describe a method, using our model, to detect the regions that contribute the most to the overall abnormality of the DTI profile of a subject's brain.",2017,Medical image analysis

Composite quantile regression and variable selection in single-index coefficient model,"Abstract In this paper, we propose a composite minimizing average check loss estimation procedure for composite quantile regression (CQR) in the single-index coefficient model (SICM). The asymptotic normalities of the proposed estimators are established, and the asymptotic relative efficiencies (ARE) of the proposed estimators compared with those by least square method are also discussed. We further investigate a variable selection procedure by combining the proposed estimation method with adaptive LASSO penalized method in CQR of SICM. The oracle property of the proposed variable selection method is also established. Simulations with various non-normal errors and one real data application are conducted to assess the finite sample performance of the proposed estimation and variable selection methods.",2016,Journal of Statistical Planning and Inference
Sparse recovery under matrix uncertainty,"We consider the model y - Y0 +, Z- X + 3? where the random vector y âˆˆ â„ n and the random n Ã— p matrix Z are observed, the n x p matrix X is unknown, Î˜ is an n x p random noise matrix, Î¾ âˆˆ â„ n is a noise independent of Î˜, and Î¸ * is a vector of unknown parameters to be estimated. The matrix uncertainty is in the fact that X is observed with additive error. For dimensions p that can be much larger than the sample size n, we consider the estimation of sparse vectors Î¸ * . Under matrix uncertainty, the Lasso and Dantzig selector turn out to be extremely unstable in recovering the sparsity pattern (i.e., of the set of nonzero components of Î¸ * ), even if the noise level is very small. We suggest new estimators called matrix uncertainty selectors (or, shortly, the MU-selectors) which are close to Î¸ * in different norms and in the prediction risk if the restricted eigenvalue assumption on X is satisfied. We also show that under somewhat stronger assumptions, these estimators recover correctly the sparsity pattern.",2010,Annals of Statistics
PruneTrain: fast neural network training by dynamic sparse model reconfiguration,"State-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) used in vision applications have large models with numerous weights. Training these models is very compute- and memory-resource intensive. Much research has been done on pruning or compressing these models to reduce the cost of inference, but little work has addressed the costs of training. We focus precisely on accelerating training. We propose PruneTrain, a cost-efficient mechanism that gradually reduces the training cost during training. PruneTrain uses a structured group-lasso regularization approach that drives the training optimization toward both high accuracy and small weight values. Small weights can then be periodically removed by reconfiguring the network model to a smaller one. By using a structured-pruning approach and additional reconfiguration techniques we introduce, the pruned model can still be efficiently processed on a GPU accelerator. Overall, PruneTrain achieves a reduction of 39% in the end-to-end training time of ResNet50 for ImageNet by reducing computation cost by 40% in FLOPs, memory accesses by 37% for memory bandwidth bound layers, and the inter-accelerator communication by 55%.",2019,"Proceedings of the International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis"
The lasso and elastic-net algorithms for predictive sound quality models using large pool of predictive metrics and factors,"Part of the overall perceived quality is communicated by sound quality. Sound quality studies present a twofold challenge. The first is that they rely on listening tests. However, listening tests are considered time consuming. The second challenge relates to the development of predictive sound quality models. Often, these models are derived using linear regression on a limited set of predictive metrics. However, nowadays, many potential metrics are available and there is no computational burden that should limit the number of potential metrics. An issue is that regression using more metrics than observations cannot lead to meaningful predictive models since all the metrics are selected. In this paper, different algorithms are compared to construct a sound quality predictive model that does not suffer from these limitations. These algorithms achieve an automatic selection of few metrics from a large pool. The lasso, elastic-net and stepwise algorithms are tested for the prediction of listening tests results of consumer product for which more than 100 metrics are used a potential predictors. It is shown that the most promising algorithm is the lasso which is able to efficiently limit the number of metrics and provide a model that can be used as understandable design guidelines.",2016,Canadian Acoustics
"Utilization of Probiotics to Manage Epizootic Shell Disease in American Lobsters, Homarus americanus","Epizootic shell disease (ESD) in the American lobster, Homarus americanus, has a major impact on the southern New England lobster industry, yet there are no practical tools for managing the disease. The goal of this study was to identify bacterial probiotics that could be used to manage ESD in wild lobster populations. Candidate bacterial isolates (n = 24) were previously isolated from lobsters in Narragansett Bay and identified as having probiotic characteristics against ESD-associated bacteria Thalassobius sp. and Aquimarina macrocephali, or the fish pathogen Vibrio anguillarum. Healthy lobster post-larvae were exposed to five of the candidate strains isolated from lobsters and a probiotic bacterial strain isolated from the Eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica (Phaeobacter inhibens S4). After several weeks of treatment, there were no significant differences in molting frequency, mortality, or growth of treated lobsters when compared with the control, indicating the candidate probiotics do not adversely affect lobster post-larvae. The effect of selected candidate probiotics (n = 3) on progression of ESD in adult lobsters was tested for three months. Frequent molting due to high disease severity confounded long-term effects of the treatments, and no significant differences were seen in mortality, molting, growth, or disease progression. These results highlight the challenges involved in the development of tools for the management of a chronic disease with a poorly understood etiology. Future research should focus on a better understanding of microbe-microbe-host interactions in ESD, and the effect of environmental conditions on these interactions.",2018,
A major challenge for graduate medical education.,"Arguably, the most pivotal period in medical education in this country was during the early 20th century when a nonphysician was given the task to objectively evaluate medical education in America. Abraham Flexner, an educator who worked at the Carnegie Foundation for Advancement of Teaching, provided a critical analysis of an educational system in medicine that had no regulatory body or structured curriculum. This landmark report on Medical Education in the United States and Canada was unveiled in 1910. 1-3 The â€œFlexner Report,â€ as it is commonly called, highlighted that a large percentage of medical schools were strictly proprietary. Very few had any type of standards or required prerequisites prior to matriculation. In fact, most medical schools were faculty owned, with tuition funding most of the faculty salaries. The majorityofthemedicalschoolsduringthis period had no hospital or university affiliation. It was reported that some of the graduates from these schools never dissected a cadaver and often did not see a singlepatient.Theshockingconclusionof theFlexnerReportwasthatmorethan120 of the 150+ operating medical schools should be closed. The report generated a quick response from the American MedicalAssociationâ€™sCouncilonMedicalEducation, which initiated the following ratingsystem:classA,fullysatisfactory;class B, redeemable; and class C, complete reorganization needed. With most of the states denying licensure to new graduates of class C schools, it resulted in almost immediate closure of the schools in this category. If they did not close outright,theclassBschoolsoftenmergedwith other schools to survive. As predicted, more than 100 medical schools eventually closed.

Review on nowcasting using least absolute shrinkage selector operator ( LASSO ) to predict dengue occurrence in San Juan and Iquitos as part of disease surveillance system,"Received Feb 8, 2019 Dengue which was first detected mainly in South East Asia during 1940s is now a serious public health concern across the subtropical and temperate regions of Americas, Europe and China due to the change in global climate and international travel. Hence, 3.9 billion people in 128 countries are exposed to the danger of potentially fatal dengue infection. This is a review paper of various dengue forecasting methodology to identify suitable models for predicting the disease occurrence in San Juan, Puerto Rico and Iquitos, Peru. Least Absolute Shrinkage Selector Operator (LASSO) model using climatic variables and Google Trends search terms as predictors was proposed to forecast dengue cases four weeks in advance. LASSOâ€™s flexibility in incorporating a variety of predictors and its ease of interpretation present LASSO as a compelling case against the general predictive models. Public health regulators could make use of such nowcasting model to facilitate the timing of vector control and public health campaigns along with the medical resource allocation to cope with potential dengue outbreaks.

"Additions, Subtractions, Iterations: Deconstruction and the Actuality of Context","Abstract The age-old rift between analytic and continental philosophy has never been as passionately and vehemently questioned as it has been in the last two or three years. The main line of attack, however, has been to demonstrate, following the example of Alain Badiou, Quentin Meillassoux and Graham Harman, that continental philosophy is no longer as tethered to an anti-realist position as it was for so many years, particularly, these same thinkers argue, during the period when Derridean deconstruction, Foucaultian discourse analysis and other such Â»poststructuralistÂ« philosophies held sway; it is hardly surprising, then, that attempts at relating these purportedly surpassed figures to currents in analytic philosophy have been fewer and farther between. The present situation cannot but overspill into the context of literary theory, where for numerous reasons of varying persuasiveness these same poststructuralists have long been chided for their textualist or culturalist excesses and for their lack of attention to matters of more substantial interest: society, history, politics, reality, the world at large. It may be argued, however, that some of these philosophies retain much potential for articulations across the analytic-continental gap, articulations that have as yet passed unseen and, once identified, call for further analysis; in the context of literary studies, this is particularly important if the shift from a textualist or culturalist paradigm to a realist or materialist one is not to yield yet another epoch of monotonous and ultimately self-defeating insulation. One such articulation, I argue in this essay, is capable of bringing together two philosophical outlooks with well established literary-critical counterparts which at first sight have but little in common: deconstruction and the so-called possible-worlds interpretation of modal logic. This articulation begins from the definition of a possible world. In contemporary philosophical logic, the concept of possible worlds is commonly interpreted as designating possible events or states of affairs that determine the extension or existential scope of the conceptual unity involved. On this view, the class of logically equivalent possible worlds corresponds to a unified set of possible reinterpretations of one and the same sentence and accords to each possible reinterpretation its own domain of individuals and relations. Assimilable into one and the same conceptual unity, these sets or states of affairs are usually conceived as alternatives to one another: every world that is possible with regard to a conceptual unity is conceived as a state of affairs that could have been realised instead of the actual one and therefore represents an alternative to the latter. This essay argues that as such the definition of a possible world does not differ from Jacques Derridaâ€™s definition of context as the set of present elements that determine the meaning of a sign: for Derrida, each signifying unit may be repeated in various different contexts which are conceptually equivalent to the precise extent that that repetition of the signifying unit maintains the identity (whether semantic, graphic, or otherwise) of the unit in question. The essay argues that in this sense, reinterpretation may be considered logically analogous to the Derridean notion of iterability, or the potential for any sign or existent to be subtracted from one context and grafted into another, upon which the above discussion of possible contexts relies. Iterability, however, causes the notion of a possible world, or more precisely that of a plurality of possible worlds, to become part of a structure that is no longer merely semantical or epistemological but also deconstructive and ontological; the relation between iterated units is not solely conceptualised in terms of alternativeness but additionally in terms of substitution. In the context in which it is iterated, the iterated unity may be said to substitute for what could have been actual in its stead; the iterated unity is therefore conceptualisable in relation to those unities which, as was also the case with respect to possible worlds, could have been realised in its place. On the basis of this observation the essay extends the analogy between possible world and possible context and argues that the issue of reinterpretability and substitutability provides the possibility for a thoroughgoing rethinking of possible-worlds semantics in terms of deconstruction, and vice versa. The limited equivalence between iterability and reinterpretability thus involves or is transformed into a limited equivalence between alternativeness and substitution: there is no alternativeness except between substitutables and no substitution except between alternatives. If it is possible to reinterpret every semantically salient totality with respect to possible worlds, reinterpretability, considered as a semantic modality of Derridaâ€™s notion of iterability, will thereby be seen to extend contextual substitutivity all the way to the referent itself. The referent itself, apart from its inclusion in a conceptual unity, exists as a substitute of those referents or existents which could have realised themselves in its place. The referent itself â€“ in its being and not merely as conceived â€“ becomes thinkable as substitutable. This reversal, I argue, will then permit the reinterpretation of the modal distinction between the actual and the possible, and the consequences of this are at least twofold. On the one hand, if reality is substitutive, a semantics founded on substitutability will be able to account for this reality in an adequate manner; on the other, if actuality is paradigmatic substitution, it follows, given the relationality of substitution, that the actual always exceeds that which can at any given moment be said of it. This gives rise to the possibility of conceiving deconstruction anew such that it affirms a realist epistemology and a substitutive ontology of the actual. The actual, I argue, is the only thing that merits being considered as paradigmatic substitution; this permits the classically deconstructive notion of futurity to be incorporated into a realistically oriented philosophy and thus allied with a literary theory that seeks a way out of the old dichotomies that continue to dominate great parts of the theoretical field.",2014,Journal of Literary Theory
A Comparative Study of the Lasso-type and Heuristic Model Selection Methods,"Summary This study presents a first comparative analysis of Lasso-type (Lasso, adaptive Lasso, elastic net) and heuristic subset selection methods. Although the Lasso has shown success in many situations, it has some limitations. In particular, inconsistent results are obtained for pairwise highly correlated predictors. An alternative to the Lasso is constituted by model selection based on information criteria (IC), which remain consistent in the situation mentioned. However, these criteria are hard to optimize due to a discrete search space. To overcome this problem, an optimization heuristic (Genetic Algorithm) is applied. To this end, results of a Monte-Carlo simulation study together with an application to an actual empirical problem are reported to illustrate the performance of the methods.",2013,JahrbÃ¼cher fÃ¼r NationalÃ¶konomie und Statistik
