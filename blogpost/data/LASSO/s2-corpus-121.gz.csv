Here, the activities of research, formation, structuring, optimization, organization and development of the assortment are particularly important. These activities are subject to the strategy of the company and are based on the demand and needs. On its part, responding effectively to consumers implies the use of new approaches toward the overall assortment management. Such an approach, for example, is assortment structuring by commodity categories, as well as the related decisions to create, manage and evaluate the effectiveness of their assortment matrix, also called commodity portfolio. Modernretailershaveavariety of toolsenabling them to carry out analyses in the specific trends of the retail assortment. It is extremely important to duly assess the situation in the retail premises.

Modeling Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Progression with Fused Laplacian Sparse Group Lasso,"Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD), the most common type of dementia, not only imposes a huge financial burden on the health care system, but also a psychological and emotional burden on patients and their families. There is thus an urgent need to infer trajectories of cognitive performance over time and identify biomarkers predictive of the progression. In this article, we propose the multi-task learning with fused Laplacian sparse group lasso model, which can identify biomarkers closely related to cognitive measures due to its sparsity-inducing property, and model the disease progression with a general weighted (undirected) dependency graphs among the tasks. An efficient alternative directions method of multipliers based optimization algorithm is derived to solve the proposed non-smooth objective formulation. The effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated by its superior prediction performance over multiple state-of-the-art methods and accurate identification of compact sets of cognition-relevant imaging biomarkers that are consistent with prior medical studies.",2018,ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD)
Dormant pulmonary vein conduction before ablation revealed by adenosine: evidence for intermittent venoatrial conduction?,"A 46-year-old man with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and a history of percutaneous occlusion of an ostium primum atrial septal defect underwent pulmonary vein (PV) isolation. Echocardiography displayed a normal left ventricular ejection fraction with mild right ventricular dilatation and normal left atrium. After transseptal access, the geometry of the left atrium was reconstructed with a 10-pole variable LassoNav catheter (Biosense Webster, Diamond Bar, CA, USA) in combination with the CARTO3 system (Biosense Webster). After an initial procedure in sinus rhythm, atrial fibrillation was mechanically induced. Voltage mapping showed no evidence of left atrial scarring. Mapping with the Lasso catheter revealed widely connected left and right inferior PVs. In contrast, no potentials were recorded in the right superior PV despite a fully deployed Lasso catheter manipulated to ascertain the adequate mapping of all segments (Panel A). Both leftand right-sided ipsilateral PVs were circumferentially ablated despite the apparent electrical isolation of the right superior PV. Sinus rhythm was restored by direct current cardioversion, and adenosine challenge was undertaken. After ruling out left PV dormant conduction, the Lasso catheter was positioned in the right superior PV. Surprisingly, repeated adenosine injection revealed a transient and reproducible conduction along the postero-superior segment of the PV that had remained electrically quiescent during the whole procedure (Panel B). After complementary segmental ablation, adenosine did not reveal any dormant conduction. Until recently, the use of adenosine was generally limited to the acute post-ablation period with the aim of restoring dormant conduction in acutely non-conducting, but still viable, muscular sleeves of PVs and other thoracic veins. In the present case, the initial PV interrogation revealed an electrically quiescent PV, while others were diffusely connected without concomitant left atrial scarring. The adenosine challenge after ablation unexpectedly revealed an electrical connection to the PV that had",2017,"Europace : European pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac electrophysiology : journal of the working groups on cardiac pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac cellular electrophysiology of the European Society of Cardiology"
Virtual lead-through robot programming : Programming virtual robot by demonstration,"This report describes the development of an application which allows a user to program a robot in a virtual environment by the use of hand motions and gestures. The application is inspired by the use of robot lead-through programming which is an easy and hands-on approach for programming robots, but instead of performing it online which creates loss in productivity the strength from offline programming where the user operates in a virtual environment is used as well. Thus, this is a method which saves on the economy and prevents contamination of the environment. To convey hand gesture information into the application which will be implemented for RobotStudio, a Kinect sensor is used for entering the data into the virtual environment. Similar work has been performed before where, by using hand movements, a physical robotâ€™s movement can be manipulated, but for virtual robots not so much. The results could simplify the process of programming robots and supports the work towards Human-Robot Collaboration as it allows people to interact and communicate with robots, a major focus of this work. The application was developed in the programming language C# and has two different functions that interact with each other, one for the Kinect and its tracking and the other for installing the application in RobotStudio and implementing the calculated data into the robot. The Kinectâ€™s functionality is utilized through three simple hand gestures to jog and create targets for the robot: open, closed and â€œlassoâ€. A prototype of this application was completed which through motions allowed the user to teach a virtual robot desired tasks by moving it to different positions and saving them by doing hand gestures. The prototype could be applied to both one-armed robots as well as to a two-armed robot such as ABBâ€™s YuMi. The robot's orientation while running was too complicated to be developed and implemented in time and became the application's main bottleneck, but remained as one of several other suggestions for further work in this project.",2015,
MÃ¡s-o-menos: a simple sign averaging method for discrimination in genomic data analysis,"MOTIVATION
The successful translation of genomic signatures into clinical settings relies on good discrimination between patient subgroups. Many sophisticated algorithms have been proposed in the statistics and machine learning literature, but in practice simpler algorithms are often used. However, few simple algorithms have been formally described or systematically investigated.


RESULTS
We give a precise definition of a popular simple method we refer to as mÃ¡s-o-menos, which calculates prognostic scores for discrimination by summing standardized predictors, weighted by the signs of their marginal associations with the outcome. We study its behavior theoretically, in simulations and in an extensive analysis of 27 independent gene expression studies of bladder, breast and ovarian cancer, altogether totaling 3833 patients with survival outcomes. We find that despite its simplicity, mÃ¡s-o-menos can achieve good discrimination performance. It performs no worse, and sometimes better, than popular and much more CPU-intensive methods for discrimination, including lasso and ridge regression.


AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION
MÃ¡s-o-menos is implemented for survival analysis as an option in the survHD package, available from http://www.bitbucket.org/lwaldron/survhd and submitted to Bioconductor.",2014,Bioinformatics
Prove di compressione e taglio in sito su pannelli in muratura: la tecnica dei maschi murari contrapposti,"Si sono compiute prove di compressione e taglio-compressione di tipo statico, in sito, su campioni di muratura isolati da un pannello di sottofinestra di un edificio scolastico costruito negli anni â€™30 in Pisa; le prove sono state eseguite sui pannelli allo stato originale ed in seguito ad un intervento di ripristino e consolidamento mediante intonaco armato e diatoni in barre di acciaio. La tessitura muraria, molto diffusa nella zona e tipica del periodo di costruzione, si basa sullâ€™utilizzo di pietra calcarea non squadrata di elevata resistenza, intervallata da ricorsi orizzontali di mattoni pieni in laterizio; il tutto collegato da copiosi giunti di malta, prevalentemente di calce aerea, di scarsa qualitÃ . La resistenza della muratura Ã¨ piuttosto bassa, cosÃ¬ che non Ã¨ stato possibile prelevare campioni per effettuarne la caratterizzazione in laboratorio. La favorevole circostanza di disporre di pannelli di sottofinestra con le medesime caratteristiche costruttive delle restanti murature portanti e di conveniente rapporto larghezza-altezza, ha consentito lâ€™individuazione di due pannelli contrapposti, di dimensioni circa 100x100cm, sufficienti a compiere test distruttivi su un campione di muratura adeguato, senza disturbare l'assetto statico della costruzione. Le prove sperimentali sono state effettuate utilizzando martinetti oleodinamici per lâ€™applicazione dei carichi verticali, indipendenti da quelli orizzontali, cosicchÃ© i due pannelli gemelli sono stati sollecitati con azioni verticali fra loro diverse e con identico carico orizzontale, variabile fino a raggiungere il collasso di uno dei due campioni. Le prove sono state ripetute dopo aver eseguito la riparazione e il consolidamento del pannello danneggiato, con lastra in c.a. e diatoni trasversali. 1 INTRODUZIONE La sempre maggiore attenzione rivolta al recupero e all'adeguamento sismico del costruito, in particolare degli edifici in muratura, di cui l'Italia possiede un vastissimo ed articolato patrimonio, ha messo in evidenza l'opportunitÃ  di condurre approfondite indagini conoscitive delle modalitÃ  costruttive dei manufatti, delle tipologie murarie e del loro comportamento meccanico a fronte di azioni sia verticali che taglianti, su cui basare le verifiche di sicurezza ed una corretta progettazione degli interventi di consolidamento. In merito, la normativa tecnica relativa agli interventi di consolidamento degli edifici situati in zona sismica, emanata con l'OPCM 3431/2005 /15/, fornisce indicazioni per la valutazione dei parametri di resistenza e di elasticitÃ  delle murature, che puÃ² avvenire, o in base alla individuazione della tipologia costruttiva ed utilizzando i valori di riferimento contenuti nella tabella 11.D.1, oppure attraverso prove sperimentali da condurre in situ. Allo stato attuale, entrambe le metodologie presentano aspetti di onerositÃ  e di incertezza. Da una parte, i parametri meccanici contenuti nella tabella, essendo ricavati da prove eseguite su un campione non sufficientemente ampio e rappresentativo della varietÃ  di tipologie esistenti, possono non essere adeguati a descrivere il reale comportamento della specifica tipologia muraria. In piÃ¹, l'utilizzo dei valori tabulati senza alcuna conferma sperimentale, obbliga ad adottare fattori di confidenza elevati, con la conseguenza che i valori di progetto delle resistenze possono risultare estremamente bassi, e gli interventi di consolidamento eccessivamente pesanti. D'altro lato, l'esecuzione di prove sperimentali in situ puÃ² risultare onerosa e di notevole impatto sulla costruzione /7/, /11/, oltre che comportare incertezze nell'interpretazione e nel corretto utilizzo dei risultati delle prove ai fini delle verifiche di resistenza degli edifici /2/, /9/. Al fine di migliorare la situazione in questo campo, due sono le strategie da seguire: effettuare un'ampia sperimentazione su campioni rappresentativi delle diverse tipologie murarie ricorrenti sul territorio nazionale, in modo da disporre di un data-base di valori di riferimento dei parametri meccanici, sufficientemente articolato e affidabile; parallelamente, curare la messa a punto e la calibrazione di metodologie di prova in situ di diversa natura e applicabilitÃ , cosÃ¬ da poter adottare, caso per caso, quella di minor impatto: ciÃ² per disporre di valori di riferimento affidabili, da confermare tramite ulteriori prove poco invasive. Per quanto riguarda il primo aspetto, anche in ottemperanza alle indicazioni contenute nell'OPCM 3431/2005, le Regioni si sono attivate per promuovere campagne di indagini sperimentali su campioni di murature delle diverse tipologie presenti sul loro territorio, /6/, /7/. Contestualmente, dall'applicazione estensiva delle metodologie di prova fin qui sperimentate, potrebbero derivare informazioni utili per la messa a punto di convincenti modalitÃ  di interpretazione dei risultati. Per quanto riguarda le metodologie di prova, le piÃ¹ utilizzate finora sono quelle che vanno sotto il nome di ""prova di Sheppard PS"" /13/, ""prova di taglio-compressione PTC"" /8/ e ""prova di compressione diagonale PCD"" /14/; tutte queste prove sono alquanto invasive, in quanto comportano di sollecitare fino al collasso pannelli murari di dimensioni superiori ad 1m x 1m per l'intero spessore della parete. Il presente lavoro descrive la sperimentazione di una diversa metodologia di prova, che puÃ² essere in taluni casi vantaggiosamente impiegata, risultando meno invasiva di altre e fornendo risultati comparabili con quelli delle prove di taglio-compressione. 2 DESCRIZIONE DELLA CAMPAGNA SPERIMENTALE La campagna sperimentale ha interessato lâ€™edificio principale del complesso edilizio che ospita lâ€™Istituto Tecnico Industriale Statale, I.T.I.S. ""Leonardo da Vinci"" a Pisa. L'edificio, risalente agli anni trenta, Ã¨ costituito da due piani: l'orizzontamento a piano terra poggia direttamente su un vespaio, il primo orizzontamento e la copertura piana sono costituiti da solai laterocementizi con luci notevoli (circa 7 m). Le strutture portanti verticali sono in muratura, con ampie aperture; le altezze di interpiano sono di circa 5 metri. In tempi recenti, la struttura Ã¨ stata interessata da alcuni dissesti, dipendenti da fenomeni di compattazione del terreno, che attualmente ne limitano l'esercizio, obbligando lâ€™Amministrazione Provinciale a prossime opere di consolidamento. Il dissesto si Ã¨ manifestato con vistosi avvallamenti nell'orizzontamento a piano terra e la formazione di lesioni inclinate nei maschi murari periferici (vedi Figura 1). Figura 1. Esempio di lesioni. Ad oggi, lâ€™ala ovest dellâ€™edificio, in parte inagibile, Ã¨ oggetto di una campagna di rilievi ed indagini conoscitive, preliminari alla progettazione degli interventi di consolidamento. Le murature di cui sono costituite le pareti portanti del fabbricato, presentano tessitura molto irregolare, con blocchi di pietra, provenienti presumibilmente dalle cave dei Monti Pisani, irregolari o appena sbozzati, di pezzatura 10 40 cm, all'apparenza di buone caratteristiche meccaniche. La malta, di calce presumibilmente aerea, si presenta di qualitÃ  scarsa, sia per quanto riguarda le proprietÃ  meccaniche, come rilevato tramite PNT-G /10/, sia per quanto riguarda la capacitÃ  di aderire ai blocchi; inoltre allâ€™interno dei pannelli murari, si sono rilevate cavitÃ  e taluni vuoti di dimensioni importanti(vedi fig. 2). Figura 2. Foto e rilievo della tessitura muraria. Le murature presentano ricorsi orizzontali a tutto spessore (listature) a passo di circa 1m, costituiti da due file di mattoni pieni; sono rivestite, su entrambe le facce, da intonaco, che si presenta, specialmente sul lato esterno, di notevole spessore e di buona qualitÃ . Gli spessori dei muri portanti sono compresi fra i 40 e i 60 cm. Le pareti perimetrali presentano finestre di ampiezza circa 3m; le murature dei sottofinestra sono della stessa tipologia e dello stesso spessore dei maschi murari. Questa caratteristica ha suggerito di effettuare prove per la caratterizzazione meccanica delle murature proprio sui pannelli di sottofinestra: infatti, seppure in condizioni diverse in ordine al sovraccarico verticale, si potevano comunque ritenere rappresentativi delle murature presenti; del resto, il disturbo allâ€™edificio causato dalle prove in questo caso Ã¨ minimo, considerato che i carichi di prova impegnano i soli pannelli, in quanto autocontrastanti alle azioni orizzontali. Le prove penetrometriche, compiute con penetrometro PNT-G, hanno permesso di determinare la resistenza a compressione della malta in sito, Wm, tramite la correlazione dello strumento con lâ€™energia dissipata per compiere una piccola cavitÃ  di dimensioni assegnate. Si Ã¨ avuta lâ€™accortezza di effettuare i test penetrometrici sia sulle superfici dei giunti di malta in vista sulle pareti dellâ€™aula interessata dalle prove (Tabella 1) e sulle pareti dellâ€™aula adiacente, sia sui letti di malta di campioni estratti dalle murature della palestra costruita nello stesso periodo (Tabella 2). In questo modo si Ã¨ verificata la consistenza della malta allâ€™interno e sulla superficie della parete; tali controlli comparati sono stati altresÃ¬ effettuati su alcuni campioni estratti durante la formazione dei pannelli per le prove di taglio-compressione. Una volta eseguite le prove di compressione semplice sui due pannelli e le prove di tagliocompressione fino al collasso di uno dei due pannelli, si Ã¨ proceduto alla riparazione di quest'ultimo mediante lâ€™applicazione, sulla faccia esterna, di una rete elettrosaldata Ï†5, maglia 10*10 cm, ancorata al pannello murario mediante 4 barre Ï†10 di acciaio FeB 44k, inserite per una profonditÃ  di circa 30cm in fori trapanati e successivamente iniettati con boiacca di cemento. Sulla superficie Ã¨ stato poi applicato uno strato di circa 3cm, di malta cementizia di tipo tixotropico fibrorinforzata; sulla faccia interna Ã¨ stato applicato uno strato di circa 1cm della medesima malta, senza alcuna armatura. Successivamente alla riparazione, s",2007,
"Platinum-group elements in Tulameen Coal, British Columbia, Canada; discussion","sures at the Blakeburn opencast pit was due to selective fixation by organic complexing of Au and PGE carried as solute or colloidal suspensions. Anomalously high concentrations of PGE in fault zones were explained by enhanced ground-water flow along more permeable channelways which promoted greater fluid-rock (coal) interactions. Two sources for the PGE were identified: an external Pt-rich source, the nearby Tulameen Ultramafic Complex; and an internal source comprising volcanic units interbedded with the coal, including tonsteins, bentonites, and basalt. On the basis of the relative abundances of Pt, Pd and Au in stream sediments, coals, and ultramafic rocks of the Tulameen Complex, Van der Flier-Keller (1991, p. 394) further proposed that the precipitation of PGE from ground waters could also account for the origin of these metals in alluvial placers of the region. It was the latter conclusion, requiring wholesale mobility and precipitation of PGE in the surficial environment, that prompted a close examination of the data that led Van der Flier-Keller to favor a low-temperature origin for PGE in coals and alluvial sediments of the Tulameen district. Previously, Raicevic and Cabri (1976) and Nixon et al. (1990) had documented a magmatic origin for platinum-group minerals in Tulameen placers and demonstrated a genetic link with chromitites in the core of the Tulameen Ultramafic Complex. Of course, there are many well-documented examples of the mobility and hydromorphic dispersion of noble metals (to varying degrees) during surface weathering of rocks and ores (e.g., Taufen and Marchetto, 1990; Wood and Vlassopoulos, 1990). In addition, experimental and theoretical work has demonstrated the ability of organic acids to complex with PGE in aqueous solutions (e.g., Wood, 1990; Plimer and Williams, 1987). However, given our present state of knowledge of the distribution of PGE in coal (Swaine, 1990), it seems unwise to invoke some poorly understood process uch as regional hydromorphic dispersion of PGE in order to account for subeconomic concentrations of these metals in coal when other more conventional mecha-",1992,Economic Geology
Discrimination of Acori Tatarinowii Rhizoma from two habitats based on GC-MS fingerprinting and LASSO-PLS-DA,"This study is intended to explore the chemical differences of Acori Tatarinowii Rhizoma (ATR) samples collected from two habitats, Sichuan and Anhui provinces, China. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was applied to establishing the quantitative chemical fingerprints of ATRs. A total of 104 volatile compounds were identified and quantified with the information of mass spectra and retention index (RI). Furthermore, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), a sparse regularization method, combined with subsampling was employed to improve the classification ability of partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). After variable selection by LASSO, three chemical markers, Î²-elemene, Î±-selinene and Î±-asarone, were identified for the discrimination of ATRs from two habitats, and the total classification correct rate was increased from 82.76% to 96.55%. The proposed LASSO-PLS-DA method can serve as an efficient strategy for screening marked chemical components and geo-herbalism research of traditional Chinese medicines.æ‘˜è¦æœ¬æ–‡æ—¨åœ¨ç ”ç©¶ä¸­å›½å››å·å’Œå®‰å¾½2 ä¸ªäº§åœ°çŸ³è–è’²æ ·å“çš„åŒ–å­¦å·®å¼‚ã€‚é¦–å…ˆé€šè¿‡æ°”ç›¸è‰²è°±-è´¨è°±è”ç”¨ (GC-MS)æŠ€æœ¯å»ºç«‹çŸ³è–è’²çš„å®šé‡åŒ–å­¦æŒ‡çº¹å›¾è°±,åŸºäºŽè‰²è°±ã€è´¨è°±ä¿¡æ¯å’Œä¿ç•™æŒ‡æ•°å®šæ€§å’Œå®šé‡äº†çŸ³è– è’²ä¸­104 ç§æŒ¥å‘æ€§åŒ–åˆç‰©ã€‚åœ¨æ­¤åŸºç¡€ä¸Š,é‡‡ç”¨ä¸€ç§ç¨€ç–æ­£åˆ™åŒ–æ–¹æ³•æ¥æé«˜åæœ€å°äºŒä¹˜-åˆ¤åˆ«åˆ†æž (PLS-DA)æ¨¡åž‹çš„åˆ†ç±»èƒ½åŠ›,ä½¿å¾—åˆ†ç±»ç²¾åº¦ä»Ž82.76%ä¸Šå‡åˆ°96.55%ã€‚æœ€åŽ,ç»“åˆæœ€å°ç»å¯¹æ”¶ç¼©ä¸Žé€‰ æ‹©ç®—å­(LASSO)ä¸ŽäºŒæ¬¡é‡‡æ ·ç­›é€‰å‡ºåŒºåˆ«äºŽ2 ä¸ªäº§åœ°çš„3 ä¸ªåŒ–å­¦æ ‡è®°ç‰©:Î²-æ¦„é¦™çƒ¯,Î±-èŠ¹èœç´ å’ŒÎ±-ç»† è¾›é†šã€‚æœ¬æ–‡é‡‡ç”¨çš„æœ€å°ç»å¯¹æ”¶ç¼©ä¸Žé€‰æ‹©ç®—å­-åæœ€å°äºŒä¹˜-åˆ¤åˆ«åˆ†æž(LASSO-PLS-DA)ç®—æ³•å¯ä»¥ä½œä¸º ç­›é€‰ä¸­è‰è¯ä¸­æ ‡å¿—æ€§åŒ–å­¦æˆåˆ†å’Œè¿›è¡Œåœ°ç†è‰è¯å­¦ç ”ç©¶çš„æœ‰æ•ˆæ–¹æ³•ã€‚",2018,Journal of Central South University
PrevisÃ£o da inflaÃ§Ã£o de alimentos no domicÃ­lio usando dados meterolÃ³gicos,"Food inflation is the most unpredictable component of CPI and the one that mostly affects peopleâ€™s lives, especially the poor. One of the reasons for food inflation volatility is its dependence on weather variations. In developing countries, all these three facts are more pronounced: First, food prices are more volatile due to the higher prevalence of fresh over processed foods; Secondly, fresh foods are more susceptible to weather variations not only because they are fresh, but also because production is usually less technological than that of processed foods; Finally, in developing countries, food-at-home represents a higher share of the already limited household budget. This has two significant consequences, the weight of food-at-home inflation is larger in developing countries CPI, and it is more difficult for people to accommodate food price increases. Therefore, we research whether meteorological data can help forecast food-at-home inflation. We study the case of Brazil, a developing country with rich historical daily weather data and with a reliable monthly inflation index published 24 times per year. We retrieved data for the last 18 years. As method, we use the lasso and Random Forest because they handle well high dimensional models. All our estimations are pseudo-out-of-sample, and we use, as benchmark, a direct estimated AR with lag order selected by BIC. Using a validation set, we choose to use climate normals averaged over the last 30 and 90 days. Our results show that the weather data improve forecasts when compared to the benchmark for each of the 1to 7-month horizons considered. On average over the horizons, the ratio to benchmark of the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) in the holdout set was 0.70 for the lasso model and 0.73 for the Random Forest model. Additionally, we use our forecasts of food-at-home inflation to forecast headline inflation. We find that, again, we could improve forecasts for all seven horizons with both models. In the holdout set, the average RMSE ratio to benchmark for the lasso was 0.87, and for the Random Forest, 0.91. Our findings suggest that weather data might substantially improve inflation forecasts in developing countries.",2019,
Pharmaceutical Care in the Treatment of Patients with Lower Urinary Tract Infections,"Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a non-specificinfectious processes, which include all kinds of infec-tions affecting various parts of itâ€™s anatomy: kidneys,ureters, bladder and urethra. Traditionally, they are di-vided into the infection of lower portion of UTI (urethri-tis, cystitis), which are found in the vast majority ofcases, and the upper (nephritis). According to statistics,the incidence of UTI in the world is about 150 millioncases per year and costs the health care systems of dif-ferent countries in more than $ 6 billion. In the U.S.,they are the cause of more than 8 million annual visitsto physicians and more than 100 thousand hospitaliza-tions. This pathology is about 50 times more common inwomen, and is generally about 5% of the populationmorbidity.

"New hosts and distribution records of Thalassomyces marsupii Kane, an ellobiopsid parasite on amphipods","Abstract This paper records six new amphipod hosts for the recently described ellobiopsid parasite Thalassomyces marsupii Kane, only known previously on Parathemisto gaudichaudi (Hyperiidea, Hyperiidae). One of these hosts is another Parathemisto species, P. abyssorum, but the other five belong to the family Eusiridae, and thus are the first records of parasitism by Ellobiopsidae in the sub-order Gammaroidea. Four of the new hosts, viz. Eusirus leptocarpus, E. longipes, Parathemisto abyssorum, and Rhachotropis macropus have been collected in western Norway; the fifth, R. aculeata, in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The record for the sixth new host, R. helleri, is based on a description and sketch in the literature (Sexton 1909), apparently misinterpreted by its author as eggs of the amphipod. Some notes on the rate of infection by Thalassomyces on Rhachotropis macropus are given and attention is drawn to the occurrence of parasite scars and double infection in this species.

Model-Based Control of Observer Bias for the Analysis of Presence-Only Data in Ecology,"Presence-only data, where information is available concerning species presence but not species absence, are subject to bias due to observers being more likely to visit and record sightings at some locations than others (hereafter ""observer bias""). In this paper, we describe and evaluate a model-based approach to accounting for observer bias directly--by modelling presence locations as a function of known observer bias variables (such as accessibility variables) in addition to environmental variables, then conditioning on a common level of bias to make predictions of species occurrence free of such observer bias. We implement this idea using point process models with a LASSO penalty, a new presence-only method related to maximum entropy modelling, that implicitly addresses the ""pseudo-absence problem"" of where to locate pseudo-absences (and how many). The proposed method of bias-correction is evaluated using systematically collected presence/absence data for 62 plant species endemic to the Blue Mountains near Sydney, Australia. It is shown that modelling and controlling for observer bias significantly improves the accuracy of predictions made using presence-only data, and usually improves predictions as compared to pseudo-absence or ""inventory"" methods of bias correction based on absences from non-target species. Future research will consider the potential for improving the proposed bias-correction approach by estimating the observer bias simultaneously across multiple species.",2013,PLoS ONE

Assessing myofiber size without biopsy: A novel application of electrical impedance techniques,"Introduction In electrical impedance myography (EIM) a weak electrical current is applied to a muscle and the resulting voltages measured. These voltages can provide structural and compositional information on the tissue, including the presence of myofiber loss and the deposition of fat and connective tissue. In addition, based on standard bioimpedance theory, by applying a multifrequency current, structural characteristics of the fibers can be identified, including myofiber size. In this study, we assessed the potential of EIM to identify myofiber size non-invasively in both healthy and diseased muscle.

Similar accuracy was also achieved in the ALS animals with an RSME of only 14% in mean myofiber area (corresponding to Â±207â€¯ Î¼ m 2 for a mean area of 1488â€¯ Î¼ m 2 ); in addition, in this group of animals we were also able to demonstrate that we could accurately predict the coefficient of variation in fiber size with a RMSE of only 8.8%. Conclusion These results demonstrate that impedance techniques can be used to assess myofiber size without the need for actual tissue biopsy. This approach for assessing the degree of myofiber size demands further development and potential application in a variety of future contexts including the assessment of neuromuscular disease status, disuse-related alterations, and the impact of therapy.",2018,Clinical Neurophysiology
"Robust, Sparse and Scalable Inference Using Bootstrap and Variable Selection Fusion","In this paper, we address the challenging problem of conducting statistical inference for large-scale data sets in the presence of sparsity and outlying observations. In particular, processing and storing such data on a single computing node may be infeasible due to its high volume and dimensionality. Therefore, the large-scale data is subdivided into smaller distinct subsets that may be stored and processed in different nodes. We propose a robust and scalable statistical inference method using a two-stage algorithm where variable selection is performed via fusing the selected support from each distinct subset of data. The actual parameter and confidence interval estimation takes place in the second stage using a robust extension of Bag of Little Bootstraps (BLB) technique. In order to exploit sparsity and ensure robustness, MM-Lasso estimator is used to select variables for each subset of data. The selections are then fused to find the support for the original large-scale data. In the second stage, the robust MM-estimator is used for the selected support. The simulation studies demonstrated the highly reliable performance of the algorithm in variable selection and providing reliable confidence intervals even if the estimation problem in the subsets is slightly under-determined.",2019,2019 IEEE 8th International Workshop on Computational Advances in Multi-Sensor Adaptive Processing (CAMSAP)

Asymptotic Analysis of Robust LASSOs in the Presence of Noise With Large Variance,"In the context of linear regression, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) is probably the most popular supervised-learning technique proposed to recover sparse signals from high-dimensional measurements. Prior literature has mainly concerned itself with independent, identically distributed noise with moderate variance. In many real applications, however, the measurement errors may have heavy-tailed distributions or suffer from severe outliers, making the LASSO poorly estimate the coefficients due to its sensitivity to large error variance. To address this concern, a robust version of the LASSO is proposed, and the limiting distribution of its estimator is derived. Model selection consistency is established for the proposed robust LASSO under an adaptation procedure of the penalty weight. A parallel asymptotic analysis is derived for the Huberized LASSO, a previously proposed robust LASSO, and it is shown that the Huberized LASSO estimator preserves similar asymptotics even with a Cauchy error distribution. We show that asymptotic variances of the two robust LASSO estimators are stabilized in the presence of large variance noise, compared with the unbounded asymptotic variance of the ordinary LASSO estimator. The asymptotic analysis from the nonstochastic design is extended to the case of random design. Simulations further confirm our theoretical results.",2010,IEEE Transactions on Information Theory

The Pisidia Heritage Trail,"The British Institute at Ankaraâ€™s cultural heritage management project sprung to life in 2013 and continues today. The main goal of the project is to create awareness about the archaeological heritage of Turkey, both among people who live in the vicinity of ancient ruins and potential tourists likely to visit these sites. Cultural heritage is, of course, a finite and fragile resource and is under constant threat. Its protection cannot be delegated simply to enforcing security measures via laws and regulations. The sites which are the focus of this project are located far from densely populated settlements and, thus, are very vulnerable to illicit digging and decay due to neglect. Since they are not very well-known to the general public and therefore not visited frequently, they donâ€™t receive sufficient government support to ensure their longevity. Their protection, therefore, must involve local communities and the fostering of a sense of pride in the sites. It is often the case that local communities become more willing to protect their local ruins when they observe them being valued and visited by others. One of the main elements of BIAAâ€™s cultural heritage management project has been the creation of the Pisidia Heritage Trail (PHT), a long-distance trekking trail, more than 350km long, connecting ten different archaeological sites located in the ancient region of Pisidia. These archaeological sites, situated in remote, pristine and densely forested highlands, have the potential to offer a quasi-poetic experience for explorers. The route of the PHT follows the remnants of 2,000-year-old ancient roads and, where these ancient roads are no longer traceable, little paths that are still used by local villagers. The trail is designed to attract hikers, nature lovers and adventurers in general, and to provide economic benefits for the communities who live in the vicinity of these ruins. This, in turn, is expected to result in increased protection of the sites by their local communities against illicit digging. As a result of various periods of fieldwork undertaken in 2015 and 2016, the identification of the route has been finalised, with nine sub-routes connecting one archaeological site to another. The basic aim in plotting the route was to encompass the most pleasurable scenery and to arrange it in such a way that the little villages along the way could be easily visited from the trail. The sub-routes are marked by an archaeological site at each end: (1) Trebenna to Termessos: 38.3km; (2) Termessos to Ariassos: 33.7km; (3) DÃ¶ÅŸemeboÄŸazÄ± (ancient road) to Sia: 13.1km; (4a) Sia to Melli: 25.2km; (4b) Sia to Kocain Cave to Melli: 30.4km; (5) Melli to Pednelissos: 61.6km; (6) Pednelissos to Selge: 48km; (7) Melli to Kremna: 42.4km; (8) Kremna to Sagalassos: 54.1km. Establishing the trail itself and its promotion through different channels are in themselves effective ways of fostering heritage protection. The project introduces an alternative tourism type to this highland region, where employment opportunities are limited, through management of this rich archaeological heritage. In the process of planning and implementing the trail, local people and authorities are being consulted at every step so that the project does not have a top-down approach, which may result in the exclusion of some parties. In addition to a formal meeting at the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, to date, the Regional Conservation Council of Antalya, Burdur Museum, local administrators of the villages along the route, national and local newspapers, the Culture Routes Society, the Antalya Chamber of Commerce and community leaders from Antalya, as well as locals living in the villages along the trail have all been consulted. The fieldwork and planning of the route, undertaken by a team of experts, was realised thanks to the support of the Aurelius Charitable Foundation. The continuation of my fellowship",2016,
Weighted Lasso Subsampling for HighDimensional Regression,"Lasso regression methods are widely used for a number of scientic applications.Many practitioners of statistics were not aware that a small changein the data would results in unstable Lasso solution path. For instance, inthe presence of outlying observations, Lasso perhaps leads the increase inthe percentage of the false selection rate of predictors. On the other hand,the discussions on determining an optimal shrinkage parameter of Lasso isstill ongoing. Therefore, this paper proposed a robust algorithm to tacklethe instability of Lasso in the presence of outliers. A new weight function isproposed to overcome the problem of outlying observations. The weightedobservations are subsamples for a certain number of subsamples to controlthe false Lasso selection. The simulation study has been carried out and usesreal data to assess the performance of our proposed algorithm. Consequently,the proposed method shows more eciency than LAD-Lasso and weightedLAD-Lasso and more reliable results.",2019,Electronic Journal of Applied Statistical Analysis

A protein level signature of four selected genes associated with survival outcomes of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma,"Abstract Background Compared with quantification of messenger RNA, a protein level quantification allows for more relevant clinical outcome predictions and the identification of potential therapeutic targets. The aim of this study was to identify a novel protein level signature that was associated with overall survival in patients with resected pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Methods Data of 105 patients with resected PDAC were retrieved from TRGAted. Reverse-phase protein array (RPPA) quantification data of 218 proteins were collected. By using the LASSO regression model, a protein-level-based classifier was built. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to assess the prognostic accuracy of the classifier. Survival curves were compared by using the Kaplan-Meier analysis. Results Using the LASSO model, we built a classifier based on four proteins: BAK, IGFBP2, PDL1, and BRAF-pS445. Survival analysis revealed IGFBP2 and BRAF-pS445 were two favourable prognostic markers, and BAK and PDL1 were unfavourable prognostic markers. Using the classifier, we were able to classify patients between those at high risk of disease progression (high-risk group) and those at low risk of disease progression (low-risk group). Progression-free survival was significantly different between these two groups (11.7 vs 19.9 months for high-risk and low-risk groups, respectively; PÂ  Conclusions This protein-level classifier is a novel prognostic tool in patients with resected PDAC.

[Risk and severity factors in cerebrovascular accidents in west african Blacks of Burkina Faso].,"This report presents the findings of a retrospective review of 193 cases of cerebrovascular attacks (CVA) diagnosed on the basis of clinical data over a 3-year period at the Bobo Dioulasso Hospital in Burkina Faso. CVA accounted for 15.1% of admissions for cardiovascular disorders. Mean patient age was 58.4 +/- 14 years and the male to female ratio was 2:1. From a socioeconomic standpoint 72% of patients had low incomes and 22% were laborers. Risk factors were poorly controlled hypertension (83.9%), obesity (44.2%), hyperlipidemia (20.6%), thromboembolism (16.6%), smoking (12.4%), hypercholesterolemia (8.1%) and diabetes (7.3%). Further study is needed to confirm risk related to red blood cell abnormalities. The event was transient ischemic attack in 22 cases (11.7%) and stroke in 171 cases (88.3%). Hospital mortality was high (31.6%) with a significantly higher death rate in elderly (p < 0.05) and female (p < 0.001) patients. Recurrent CVA within a mean delay of 9 to 12 months following the initial event was observed in 11.4% of survivors and was fatal in 80%. The authors emphasize the need for improvement in the management of arterial hypertension by district physicians and for prevention of thromboembolic complications in high-risk patients.",1997,Medecine tropicale : revue du Corps de sante colonial
Microarray Gene Expression Data with Linked Survival Phenotypes: Diffuse Large-B-Cell Lymphoma Revisited,"Diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an aggressive malignancy of mature B lymphocytes and is the most common type of lymphoma in adults. While treatment advances have been substantial in what was formerly a fatal disease, less than 50% of patients achieve lasting remission. In an effort to predict treatment success and explain disease heterogeneity clinical features have been employed for prognostic purposes, but have yielded only modest predictive performance. This has spawned a series of high profile microarray-based gene expression studies of DLBCL, in the hope that molecular level information could be used to refine prognosis. The intent of this paper is to reevaluate these microarray-based prognostic assessments, and extend the statistical methodology that has been used in this context. Methodological challenges arise in using patientsâ€™ gene expression profiles to predict survival endpoints on account of the large number of genes and their complex interdependence. We initially focus on the Lymphochip data and analysis of Rosenwald et al., (2002). After describing relationships between the analyses performed and gene harvesting (Hastie et al., 2001), we argue for the utility of penalized approaches, in particular LARS-Lasso (Efron et al., 2004). While these techniques have been extended to the proportional hazards / partial likelihood framework, the resultant algorithms are computationally burdensome. We develop residualbased approximations that eliminate this burden yet perform similarly. Comparisons of predictive accuracy across both methods and studies are effected using time-dependent ROC curves. These indicate that gene expression data, in turn, only delivers modest predictions of post therapy DLBCL survival. We conclude by outlining possibilities for further work.",2005,

Spain retains its title and sets a new record â€“ generalized linear mixed models on European football championships,"Nowadays many approaches that analyze and predict the results of football matches are based on bookmakersâ€™ ratings. It is commonly accepted that the models used by the bookmakers contain a lot of expertise as the bookmakersâ€™ profits and losses depend on the performance of their models. One objective of this article is to analyze the role of bookmakersâ€™ odds together with many additional, potentially influental covariates with respect to a national teamâ€™s success at European football championships and especially to detect covariates, which are able to explain parts of the information covered by the odds. Therefore a pairwise Poisson model for the number of goals scored by national teams competing in European football championship matches is used. Moreover, the generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) approach, which is a widely used tool for modeling cluster data, allows to incorporate team-specific random effects. Two different approaches to the fitting of GLMMs incorporating variable selection are used, subset selection as well as a Lasso-type technique, including an L1-penalty term that enforces variable selection and shrinkage simultaneously. Based on the two preceeding European football championships a sparse model is obtained that is used to predict all matches of the current tournament resulting in a possible course of the European football championship (EURO) 2012.",2013,Journal of Quantitative Analysis in Sports
A Multi-Country Approach to Forecasting Output Growth Using PMIS,"This paper derives new theoretical results for forecasting with Global VAR (GVAR) models. It is shown that the presence of a strong unobserved common factor can lead to an undeter-mined GVAR model. To solve this problem, we propose augmenting the GVAR with additional proxy equations for the strong factors and establish conditions under which forecasts from the augmented GVAR model (AugGVAR) uniformly converge in probability to the infeasible optimal forecasts obtained from a factor-augmented high-dimensional VAR model. The small sample properties of the proposed solution are investigated by Monte Carlo experiments as well as empirically. In the empirical part, we investigate the value of the information content of Purchasing Managers Indices (PMIs) for forecasting global (48 countries) growth, and compare forecasts from AugGVAR models with a number of data-rich forecasting methods, including Lasso, Ridge, partial least squares and factor-based methods. It is found that (a) regardless of the forecasting methods considered, PMIs are useful for nowcasting, but their value added diminishes quite rapidly with the forecast horizon, and (b) AugGVAR forecasts do as well as other data-rich forecasting techniques for short horizons, and tend to do better for longer forecast horizons.",2016,Journal of Econometrics
Evaluation of Genomic Prediction Methods for Fusarium Head Blight Resistance in Wheat,"Fusarium head blight (FHB) resistance is quantitative and diffi cult to evaluate. Genomic selection (GS) could accelerate FHB resistance breeding. We used U.S. cooperative FHB wheat nursery data to evaluate GS models for several FHB resistance traits including deoxynivalenol (DON) levels. For all traits we compared the models: ridge regression (RR), Bayesian LASSO (BL), reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) regression, random forest (RF) regression, and multiple linear regression (MLR) (fi xed effects). For DON, we evaluated additional prediction methods including bivariate RR models, phenotypes for correlated traits, and RF regression models combining markers and correlated phenotypes as predictors. Additionally, for all traits, we compared different marker sets including genomewide markers, FHB quantitative trait loci (QTL) targeted markers, and both sets combined. Genomic selection accuracies were always higher than MLR accuracies, RF and RKHS regression were often the most accurate methods, and for DON, marker plus trait RF regression was more accurate than all other methods. For all traits except DON, using QTL targeted markers alone led to lower accuracies than using genomewide markers. This study indicates that cooperative FHB nursery data can be useful for GS, and prior information about correlated traits and QTL could be used to improve accuracies in some cases.",2012,The Plant Genome

"Genome annotation and comparative genomic analysis of Bacillus subtilis MJ01, a new bio-degradation strain isolated from oil-contaminated soil","One of the main challenges in elimination of oil contamination from polluted environments is improvement of biodegradation by highly efficient microorganisms. Bacillus subtilis MJ01 has been evaluated as a new resource for producing biosurfactant compounds. This bacterium, which produces surfactin, is able to enhance bio-accessibility to oil hydrocarbons in contaminated soils. The genome of B. subtilis MJ01 was sequenced and assembled by PacBio RS sequencing technology. One big contig with a length of 4,108,293Â bp without any gap was assembled. Genome annotation and prediction of gene showed that MJ01 genome is very similar to B. subtilis spizizenii TU-B-10 (95% similarity). The comparison and analysis of orthologous genes carried out between B. subtilis MJ01, reference strain B. subtilis subsp. subtilis str. 168, and close relative spizizenii TU-B-10 by microscope platform and various bioinformatics tools. More than 88% of 4269 predicted coding sequences in MJ01 had at least one similar sequence in genome of reference strain and spizizenii TU-B-10. Despite this high similarity, some differences were detected among encoding sequences of non-ribosome protein and bacteriocins in MJ01 and spizizenii TU-B-10.

Vector approximate message passing algorithm for compressed sensing with structured matrix perturbation,"Abstract In this paper, we consider a general form of noisy compressive sensing (CS) where the sensing matrix is not precisely known. Such cases exist when there are imperfections or unknown calibration parameters during the measurement process. Particularly, the sensing matrix may have some structure, which makes the perturbation follow a fixed pattern. Previous work has focused on extending the approximate message passing (AMP) and LASSO algorithm to deal with the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) perturbation. Based on the recent VAMP algorithm, we take the structured perturbation into account and propose the perturbation considered vector approximate message passing (PC-VAMP) algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of PC-VAMP.",2020,Signal Process.
ConvexLAR: An Extension of Least Angle Regression.,"The least angle regression (LAR) was proposed by Efron, Hastie, Johnstone and Tibshirani (2004) for continuous model selection in linear regression. It is motivated by a geometric argument and tracks a path along which the predictors enter successively and the active predictors always maintain the same absolute correlation (angle) with the residual vector. Although it gains popularity quickly, its extensions seem rare compared to the penalty methods. In this expository article, we show that the powerful geometric idea of LAR can be generalized in a fruitful way. We propose a ConvexLAR algorithm that works for any convex loss function and naturally extends to group selection and data adaptive variable selection. After simple modification it also yields new exact path algorithms for certain penalty methods such as a convex loss function with lasso or group lasso penalty. Variable selection in recurrent event and panel count data analysis, Ada-Boost, and Gaussian graphical model is reconsidered from the ConvexLAR angle.",2015,"Journal of computational and graphical statistics : a joint publication of American Statistical Association, Institute of Mathematical Statistics, Interface Foundation of North America"
No Skimming Allowed,"BIOMECHANICS
Pterosaurs were flying reptiles and the first air-borne vertebrates; they dominated the skies from the late Triassic to the end of the Cretaceous, during the epoch of their relatives, the dinosaurs. On the basis of similarities in jaw structure, it has been suggested that several pterosaurs, including Thalassodromeus and the giant Quetzalcoatlus (with a wingspan of up to 15 m), could have fed by skimming in a manner akin to that of extant ternlike shorebirds ( Rynchops spp.) Skimmers fly low over calm shallow water with the tip of their lower beak dipping beneath the water surface. Humphries et al. have used full-sized models of mandibles from Thalassodromeus and the modern skimmer R. niger to demonstrate that the pterosaur bill would have generated an order of magnitude more drag in traveling through the water. Modeling indicated that the energetic cost to a shorebird of flying with its beak in the water is almost prohibitive (~20% of the total cost of flight), and the authors suggest this levy might explain the rarity of the skimming life-style. The substantially greater cost for a pterosaur larger than 2 kg appears to exclude outright skimming as a possible means for procuring food. Furthermore, many of the morphological specializations to the head and neck seen in Rynchops are not found in pterosaurs of any size, including the ability to regenerate broken or abraded bill tips and the presence of a reinforced lower jaw. â€” GR

The vulnerability of men to virologic failure during antiretroviral therapy in a public routine clinic in Burkina Faso,"INTRODUCTION
Gender differences in antiretroviral therapy (ART) outcomes are critical in sub-Saharan Africa. We assessed the association between gender and virologic failure among adult patients treated in a public routine clinic (one of the largest in West Africa) in Burkina Faso.


METHODS
We performed a case-control study between July and October 2012 among patients who had received ART at the Bobo Dioulasso Day Care Unit. Patients were eligible if they were 15 years or older, positive for HIV-1 or HIV-1+2, and on first-line ART for at least six months. Cases were all patients with two consecutive HIV loads >1000 copies/mL (Biocentric Generic or Abbott Real Time assays), or one HIV load >1000 copies/mL associated with immunologic or clinical failure criteria. Controls were all patients who only had HIV loads <300 copies/mL. The association between gender and virologic failure was assessed using a multivariate logistic regression, adjusted on age, level of education, baseline CD4+ T cell count, first and current antiretroviral regimens and time on ART.


RESULTS
Of 2303 patients (74.2% women; median age: 40 years; median time on ART: 34 months), 172 had virologic failure and 2131 had virologic success. Among the former, 130 (75.6%) had confirmed virologic failure, 38 (22.1%) had viro-immunologic failure, and four (2.3%) had viro-clinical failure. The proportion of men was significantly higher among the cases than among the controls (37.2% vs. 24.9%; p<0.001). Compared to controls, cases were also younger, more immunodeficient at ART initiation, less likely to receive a protease inhibitor-based antiretroviral regimen and had spent a longer period of time on ART. After adjustment, male gender remained strongly associated with virologic failure (odds ratio 2.52, 95% CI: 1.77-3.60; p<0.001).


CONCLUSIONS
Men on ART appeared more vulnerable to virologic failure than women. Additional studies are needed to confirm the poorer prognosis of men in this setting and to determine the causes for their vulnerability in order to optimize HIV care. From now on, efforts should be made to support the adherence of men to ART in the African setting.",2014,Journal of the International AIDS Society

Do you teach the way you were taught? Graduate teachers perception of their undergraduate teacher preparation at the university,"This research study eva 
luated the effectiveness of the Bachelor of Arts Education (BA.Ed.) 
in preparing secondary school teachers. Using the views of the Graduate teachers the study 
focused on two issues; Firstly, the theoretical coverage of four selected aspects of the 
pedagogi 
cal curriculum namely; classroom organization and management, lesson structure, 
skills and techniques of teaching and teaching methods. Secondly, the perceived teaching 
practices of graduate teachers in their secondary school classrooms. Two hundred and 
se 
venteen graduate teachers who completed the programme in 2007, 2008 and 2009 from 
the Islamic university in Uganda participated in this study. The study used Process and 
Product of the Stufflebeamâ€˜s CIPP evaluation model through a mixed method research 
des 
ign of quantitative and qualitative approaches. The data was analysed using Pearson 
- 
Product moment correlation, MANOVA tests, descriptive statistics and coding of themes. 
The results show that most areas of classooroom organization and management received 
more than adequate 
coverage including; ability to address studentsâ€˜ differences in the 
classroom, ability to handle studntsâ€˜ discipline and ability to engage students. However, 
results show that the following areas reeived 
less than adequate 
coverage; desi

- 
based teaching 
skills and Projet method. The study discovered that there is a strong relationship between 
theory of coverage and graduate teachersâ€˜ practices in all the selected a 
spects of the 
pedagogical curriculum. The qualitative research findings show that 56% of graduate 
teachers do not use lesson planning in their classrooms because they regard it is 
time 
wasting 
. It was discovered that gender does not have statistically sign 
ificant effect on 
practicing aspects of the pedagogical curriculum. The descriptive statistics show that; 
History teachers conduct their classes in a better organized and managed classroom than 
IRE teachers. The graduate teachers of 2008 practice these asp 
ects more than graduate 
teachers of 2007 and 2009. The level of practice of graduate teachers of 2007 in all aspects 
is less than those who graduated in 2008 and 2009. The study recommends among others;

Robust iteratively reweighted Lasso for sparse tensor factorizations,"A new tensor approximation method is developed based on the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) factorization that enjoys both sparsity (i.e., yielding factor matrices with some nonzero elements) and resistance to outliers and non-Gaussian measurement noise. This method utilizes a robust bounded loss function for errors in the low-rank tensor approximation while encouraging sparsity with Lasso (or â„“1-) regularization to the factor matrices (of a tensor data). A simple alternating, iteratively reweighted (IRW) Lasso algorithm is proposed to solve the resulting optimization problem. Simulation studies illustrate that the proposed method provides excellent performance in terms of mean square error accuracy for heavy-tailed noise conditions, with relatively small loss in conventional Gaussian noise.",2014,2014 IEEE Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing (SSP)
Online Homotopy Algorithm for a Generalization of the LASSO,"The LASSO is a widely used shrinkage method for linear regression. We propose an online homotopy algorithm to solve a generalization of the LASSO in which the l1 regularization is applied on a linear transformation of the solution, allowing to input prior information on the structure of the problem and to improve interpretability of the results. The algorithm takes advantage of the sparsity of the solution for computational efficiency and is promising for mining large datasets.",2013,IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control
Ecological Crises and the Agrarian Question in World-Historical Perspective,"Lâ€™inserimento della Questione Agraria entro una prospettiva di longue duree permette di scorgerne i caratteri storico-strutturali e, in particolare, il ruolo fondamentale che essa ha giocato in passato per il sorgere e il mantenimento, nel presente per la deriva critica globale del capitalismo; e permette altresi di rappresentare lo sviluppo del capitale come un meccanismo generativo di crisi ecologiche di portata via via crescente, in cui i processi di accumulazione ed espansione sono sostenuti da - e risultano in - simmetrici processi di spoliazione del patrimonio ambientale e sociale. Il concetto di â€˜crisi ecologicaâ€™ viene cosi sottratto ad una caratterizzazione â€˜epocaleâ€™, in cui appare come il mero corollario del collasso finale del sistema capitalistico, e ricompreso nella sua natura â€˜evolutivaâ€™, come cadenza di fondo che segna le ondate ritmiche della civilizzazione moderna e contemporanea. Il progressivo esaurimento delle risorse naturali primarie, dovuto al raggiungimento dei limiti fisici dellâ€™espansione globale del capitale, restituisce oggi alla questione dellâ€™agricoltura e della terra, nel registro drammatico, la stessa centralita che essa deteneva nel periodo eroico del capitalismo; avviandola cosi a diventare il terreno cruciale di uno scontro che sembra decisivo non solo per le sorti dellâ€™attuale sistema economico-sociale, ma per la stessa sopravvivenza della vita umana.",2013,
Synaptic structure and function: Dynamic organization yields architectural precision,"Marie E. Burns and George J. Augustine Department of Neurobiology Duke University Medical Center Durham. North Carolina 27710 The power of the brain is based upon the extraordinary abilities of nerve cells to communicate with each other at specialized intercellular junctions called synapses. As other papers in this issue of Ce// discuss (see Garrity and Zipursky, 1995; Keynes and Cook, 1995), other forms of interneuronal communication also occur, especially dur- ing neuronal development. Here we focus on the commu- nication taking place at the most prominent type of syn- apse, the â€œchemicalâ€ synapse. At such synapses, signal transmission is mediated by neurotransmitters that are rapidly secreted, from the presynaptic neuron onto the postsynaptic neuron, in response to a presynaptic action potential. Synaptic transmission requires elaborate struc- tural specializations in both presynaptic and postsynaptic cells, as well as precise spatial alignment between the structures on the two sides of the synapse. In addition, because transmission at synapses is highly modifiable, the architecture of synapses must also be very dynamic. This review is intended as a guide to the well-appreciated structural organization of chemical synapses and attempts to relate the structure of synapses to their function as sites of neuronal communication. Essential Structures of Synapses Each of the billions of synapses in a mammalian brain has the same general task: to release and detect neurotrans- mitters. Thus, although there is a broad spectrum of syn- apses, all share certain fundamental structural features that are responsible for conserved functions. We begin with a brief survey of these general architectural features. For a more comprehensive overview of this subject. see Heuser and Reese (1977). Presynaptic Structure The terminals of presynaptic neurons all need to synthe- size and store neurotransmitters and then secrete these transmitters in a regulated manner. Except for rare exam- ples of nonvesicular transmitter release (Attwell et al., 1993), neurotransmitters are stored within membrane- bound organelles called synaptic vesicles. A typical pre- synaptic terminal may contain a few hundred synapticves- icles, though this number varies widely among synapses (Harris and Kater, 1994) and, as discussed below, changes dynamically while the synapse is active. Synaptic vesicle size varies, largely depending upon the type of neurotransmitter contained within the vesicles. Generally, vesicles containing fast-acting neurotransmitters are ap- proximately 50 nm in diameter and appear to have clear centers when viewed with an electron microscope. A sec- ond classof synapticvesicles, which contain slower-acting transmitters and proteinaceous material, are usually larger in diameter (up to several hundred nanometers) and have an electron-dense core.",1995,Cell
"Helminth parasites of Natal long-fingered bats, Miniopterus natalensis (Chiroptera : Miniopteridae), in South Africa : research communication","The helminth community infecting Miniopterus natalensis was studied at two localities, the De Hoop Nature Reserve (DHNR) ( n = 57), Western Cape Province and Pretoria ( n = 12), Gauteng Province, South Africa. Hosts from the DHNR had formed part of an earlier, unrelated study and were all pregnant females. A single hymenolepidid cestode species, the nematodes Molinostrongylus ornatus and Litomosa chiropterorum together with nematodes of the subfamily Capillariinae were present at both study sites, while a single digenean, Allassogonoporus sp., was only found in hosts from the DHNR. The prevalence of helminth infections was high at both localities, 68.4 % in the DHNR and 77.7 % in Pretoria, whereas the mean intensity of infection was low at the DHNR (3.76 Â± 3.15), but higher in Pretoria (10.4 Â± 9.9). Molinostrongylus ornatus and, to a lesser extent L. chiropterorum , were the main contributors to the higher intensities in Pretoria. The species richness ranged from 0 to 4 at both localities.",2008,Onderstepoort Journal of Veterinary Research
Finding the balance between model complexity and performance: Using ventral striatal oscillations to classify feeding behavior in rats,"The ventral striatum (VS) is a central node within a distributed network that controls appetitive behavior, and neuromodulation of the VS has demonstrated therapeutic potential for appetitive disorders. Local field potential (LFP) oscillations recorded from deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes within the VS are a pragmatic source of neural systems-level information about appetitive behavior that could be used in responsive neuromodulation systems. Here, we recorded LFPs from the bilateral nucleus accumbens core and shell (subregions of the VS) during limited access to palatable food across varying conditions of hunger and food palatability in male rats. We used standard statistical methods (logistic regression) as well as the machine learning algorithm lasso to predict aspects of feeding behavior using VS LFPs. We were able to predict the amount of food eaten, the increase in consumption following food deprivation, and the type of food eaten. Further, we were able to predict whether the initiation of feeding was imminent up to 42.5 seconds before feeding began and classify current behavior as either feeding or not-feeding. In classifying feeding behavior, we found an optimal balance between model complexity and performance with models using 3 LFP features primarily from the alpha and high gamma frequencies. As shown here, unbiased methods can identify systems-level neural activity linked to domains of mental illness with potential application to the development and personalization of novel treatments.",2019,PLoS Computational Biology
Neuro-Current Response Functions: A Unified Approach to MEG Source Analysis under the Continuous Stimuli Paradigm,"Characterizing the neural dynamics underlying sensory processing is one of the central areas of investigation in systems and cognitive neuroscience. Neuroimaging techniques such as magnetoencephalography (MEG) and Electroencephalography (EEG) have provided significant insights into the neural processing of continuous stimuli, such as speech, thanks to their high temporal resolution. Existing work in the context of auditory processing suggests that certain features of speech, such as the acoustic envelope, can be used as reliable linear predictors of the neural response manifested in M/EEG. The corresponding linear filters are referred to as temporal response functions (TRFs). While the functional roles of specific components of the TRF are well-studied and linked to behavioral attributes such as attention, the cortical origins of the underlying neural processes are not as well understood. In this work, we address this issue by estimating a linear filter representation of cortical sources directly from neuroimaging data in the context of continuous speech processing. To this end, we introduce Neuro-Current Response Functions (NCRFs), a set of linear filters, spatially distributed throughout the cortex, that predict the cortical currents giving rise to the observed ongoing MEG (or EEG) data in response to continuous speech. NCRF estimation is cast within a Bayesian framework, which allows unification of the TRF and source estimation problems, and also facilitates the incorporation of prior information on the structural properties of the NCRFs. To generalize this analysis to M/EEG recordings which lack individual structural magnetic resonance (MR) scans, NCRFs are extended to free-orientation dipoles and a novel regularizing scheme is put forward to lessen reliance on fine-tuned coordinate co-registration. We present a fast estimation algorithm, which we refer to as the Champ-Lasso algorithm, by leveraging recent advances in optimization, and demonstrate its utility through application to simulated and experimentally recorded MEG data under auditory experiments. Our simulation studies reveal significant improvements over existing methods that typically operate in a two-stage fashion, in terms of spatial resolution, response function reconstruction, and recovering dipole orientations. The analysis of experimentally-recorded MEG data without MR scans corroborates existing findings, but also delineates the distinct cortical distribution of the underlying neural processes at high spatiotemporal resolution. In summary, we provide a principled modeling and estimation paradigm for MEG source analysis tailored to extracting the cortical origin of electrophysiological responses to continuous stimuli.",2019,bioRxiv
Regularized M-estimators with nonconvexity: statistical and algorithmic theory for local optima,"We provide novel theoretical results regarding local optima of regularized $M$-estimators, allowing for nonconvexity in both loss and penalty functions. Under restricted strong convexity on the loss and suitable regularity conditions on the penalty, we prove that \emph{any stationary point} of the composite objective function will lie within statistical precision of the underlying parameter vector. Our theory covers many nonconvex objective functions of interest, including the corrected Lasso for errors-in-variables linear models; regression for generalized linear models with nonconvex penalties such as SCAD, MCP, and capped-$\ell_1$; and high-dimensional graphical model estimation. We quantify statistical accuracy by providing bounds on the $\ell_1$-, $\ell_2$-, and prediction error between stationary points and the population-level optimum. We also propose a simple modification of composite gradient descent that may be used to obtain a near-global optimum within statistical precision $\epsilon$ in $\log(1/\epsilon)$ steps, which is the fastest possible rate of any first-order method. We provide simulation studies illustrating the sharpness of our theoretical results.",2015,
Regularization Parameter Selection for a Bayesian Multi-Level Group Lasso Regression Model with Application to Imaging Genomics,"We investigate the choice of tuning parameters for a Bayesian multi-level group lasso model developed for the joint analysis of neuroimaging and genetic data. The regression model we consider relates multivariate phenotypes consisting of brain summary measures (volumetric and cortical thickness values) to single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) data and imposes penalization at two nested levels, the first corresponding to genes and the second corresponding to SNPs. Associated with each level in the penalty is a tuning parameter which corresponds to a hyperparameter in the hierarchical Bayesian formulation. Following previous work on Bayesian lassos we consider the estimation of tuning parameters through either hierarchical Bayes based on hyperpriors and Gibbs sampling or through empirical Bayes based on maximizing the marginal likelihood using a Monte Carlo EM algorithm. For the specific model under consideration we find that these approaches can lead to severe overshrinkage of the regression parameter estimates in the high-dimensional setting or when the genetic effects are weak. We demonstrate these problems through simulation examples and study an approximation to the marginal likelihood which sheds light on the cause of this problem. We then suggest an alternative approach based on the widely applicable information criterion (WAIC), an asymptotic approximation to leave-one-out cross-validation that can be computed conveniently within an MCMC framework.",2016,arXiv: Machine Learning

Model Geographically Weighted Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Gw-Lasso) pada Data Penderita Diare di Indonesia,"AbstrakDiare merupakan penyumbang utama angka kesakitan dan kematian pada anak di berbagai negara. Indonesia termasuk 15 negara teratas dengan jumlah penderita diare terbanyak. Menurut KEMENKES RI, case fatality rate (CFR) akibat diare pada tahun 2016 mengalami kenaikan sebesar 3,04%. Enam faktor yang diduga memengaruhi persentase penderita diare adalah persentase penduduk miskin, persentase dokter, persentase rumah tangga yang memiliki jamban, persentase sumber air minum berasal dari air tanah, persentase rumah sakit, dan persentase puskesmas. Pengaruh dari faktor-faktor tersebut ditentukan menggunakan model regresi. Perbedaan karakteristik antar wilayah berakibat adanya kasus KLB yang terjadi di beberapa provinsi. Terdapat variasi antar lokasi disebut heterogenitas spasial sehingga dapat digunakan model geographically weighted regression (GWR). Estimasi parameter pada GWR menggunakan metode kuadarat terkecil terboboti atau weighted least square (WLS). Fungsi pembobot yang digunakan adalah fungsi pembobot kernel Gaussian yang memberikan pembobot sesuai bandwidth optimum yang nilainya diperoleh dari cross validation (CV). Penambahan fungsi pembobot mengakibatkan korelasi antar variabel meningkat sehingga diindikasikan terdapat multikolinearitas pada model GWR. Multikolinearitas merupakan kondisi terdapatnya korelasi antara variabel prediktor sehingga mengakibatkan hasil estimasi parameter memiliki variansi yang besar. Dalam kasus ini GWR tidak dapat mengatasi masalah multikolinieritas. Metode untuk mengatasi masalah multikolinearitas adalah least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). LASSO melakukan estimasi dengan algoritme least angle regression (LARS) yang menyusutkan estimasi parameter sampai ke nol menggunakan parameter penyusutan (shrinkage) (s). Nilai parameter shrinkage ditentukan melalui cross validation (CV). Metode LASSO yang diaplikasikan pada model GWR yang dikenal dengan istilah geographically weighted LASSO (GW-LASSO). Model GW-LASSO dapat diselesaikan dengan dua cara yaitu GW-LASSO lokal dan GW-LASSO global. Tujuan penelitian ini adalah menerapkan model GW-LASSO pada data penderita diare di Indonesia dengan fungsi pembobot Gaussian. Berdasarkan hasil penelitian, diperoleh model GW-LASSO global dengan nilai parameter (s) sebesar 0.960. Model GW-LASSO lokal yang dapat dibentuk dari 34 provinsi adalah 23 model.

Prise en compte des groupes de biomarqueurs ou des voies biologiques dans les modÃ¨les de Cox pÃ©nalisÃ©s de haute dimension,"Problematique Le developpement de technologies genomiques a haut debit a permis la croissance rapide et la disponibilite plus facile de tres grandes donnees genomiques. Le modele a risques proportionnels de Cox est couramment utilise pour estimer lâ€™effet dâ€™un ou de plusieurs facteurs pronostiques pour des criteres de jugement de type survie. La methode de regression penalisee Lasso est utilisee pour selectionner des biomarqueurs dans des donnees de haute dimension, mais cette methode ne prend pas en compte les connaissances des roles biologiques des biomarqueurs, par exemple les voies biologiques (Â«Â pathwaysÂ Â») connues. Methodologie Nous presentons differentes penalisations pour que le modele de Cox selectionne correctement les biomarqueurs groupes afin de favoriser la selection de biomarqueurs pronostiques (actifs) qui, en plus dâ€™avoir un effet individuel important, appartiennent a un groupe actif. Nous avons considere le cas des groupes pre-specifies et disjoints. Nous proposons la methode Lasso Adaptatif avec des differents poids specifiques pour chaque voie biologique. Nous avons compare notre methode proposee avec deux autres methodes, le Â«Â Sparse Group LassoÂ Â» (SGL) et le Â«Â Lasso IntegratifÂ Â» avec des facteurs de Penalisation (IPF-Lasso). Pour lâ€™approche Â«Â Lasso AdaptatifÂ Â», nous avons considere six strategies de ponderation.

"Bacterial community associated with Ctenophores at Helgoland Roads, German Bight","Question 
Large increases in gelatinous zooplankton populations have occurred in many coastal and estuarine ecosystems worldwide because of eutrophication, climate change, and anthropogenic activities which have greatly altered the natural marine environment. Jellyfish release nutrients and dissolved organic matter which may stimulate bacterioplankton growth. However information about the community structure of the bacteria associated with ctenophores is rare. 
Methods 
Four ctenophores species Mnemiopsis leidyi, Beroe sp., Bolinopsis infundibulum and Pleurobrachia pileus were sampled at Helgoland Roads in the Germany Bight, North Sea from Oct.2009 to Oct. 2010. Each individual was washed 5 times with sterile seawater to remove transient and loosely associated microorganisms from the surfaces of ctenophores, and then total genomic DNA was extracted from freeze-dried tissue. Automated Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer Analysis (ARISA) fingerprinting and 16S ribosomal amplicon pyrosequencing were performed to investigate the structure and diversity of the bacterial communities associated with ctenophores. 
Results 
We revealed significant differences between associated-bacterial communities among different ctenophores species based on ARISA fingerprinting (P<0.001). Based on 16S ribosomal amplicon pyrosequencing, Proteobacteria (87%-98%) were the majority of the predominant bacteria in ctenophores. Within the Proteobacteria, M. leidyi and P. pileus mainly harbored Gammaproteobacteria, Marinomonas made up the majority of the predominant Gammaproteobacteria in M. leidyi. Conversely, in P. pileus the Gammaproteobacteria were mainly composed of the genera Pseudoalteromonas and Psychrobacter. The bacterial community of B. infundibulum comprised of 46.5% Alphaproteobacteria and 52.71% Gammaproteobacteria which in specific were Thalassospira and Marinomonas. Beroe sp. was mainly dominated by Alphaproteobacteria, particularly by the genus Thalassospira. 
Conclusion 
1. Bacterial communities associated with ctenophores displayed a low diverse and highly species-specific character. The genus Marinomonas, Pseudoalteromonas, Psychrobacter and Thalassospira are the predominant groups. 
2. Bacterial communities associated with ctenophores were consistently divergent from those presented in the surrounding sea water which has been reported before.",2013,
A Pseudo Knockoff Filter for Correlated Features,"In 2015, Barber and Candes introduced a new variable selection procedure called the knockoff filter to control the false discovery rate (FDR) and prove that this method achieves exact FDR control. Inspired by the work of Barber and Candes (2015), we propose and analyze a pseudo-knockoff filter that inherits some advantages of the original knockoff filter and has more flexibility in constructing its knockoff matrix. Although we have not been able to obtain exact FDR control of the pseudo knockoff filter, we show that it satisfies an expectation inequality that offers some insight into FDR control. Moreover, we provide some partial analysis of the pseudo knockoff filter for the half Lasso and the least squares statistics. Our analysis indicates that the inverse of the covariance matrix of the feature matrix plays an important role in designing and analyzing the pseudo knockoff filter. Our preliminary numerical experiments show that the pseudo knockoff filter with the half Lasso statistic has FDR control. Moreover, our numerical experiments show that the pseudo-knockoff filter could offer more power than the original knockoff filter with the OMP or Lasso Path statistic when the features are correlated and non-sparse.",2017,Information and Inference: A Journal of the IMA
Competing Risks Data Analysis with High-dimensional Covariates: An Application in Bladder Cancer,"Analysis of microarray data is associated with the methodological problems of high dimension and small sample size. Various methods have been used for variable selection in high-dimension and small sample size cases with a single survival endpoint. However, little effort has been directed toward addressing competing risks where there is more than one failure risks. This study compared three typical variable selection techniques including Lasso, elastic net, and likelihood-based boosting for high-dimensional time-to-event data with competing risks. The performance of these methods was evaluated via a simulation study by analyzing a real dataset related to bladder cancer patients using time-dependent receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve and bootstrap .632+ prediction error curves. The elastic net penalization method was shown to outperform Lasso and boosting. Based on the elastic net, 33 genes out of 1381 genes related to bladder cancer were selected. By fitting to the Fine and Gray model, eight genes were highly significant (P<0.001). Among them, expression of RTN4, SON, IGF1R, SNRPE, PTGR1, PLEK, and ETFDH was associated with a decrease in survival time, whereas SMARCAD1 expression was associated with an increase in survival time. This study indicates that the elastic net has a higher capacity than the Lasso and boosting for the prediction of survival time in bladder cancer patients. Moreover, genes selected by all methods improved the predictive power of the model based on only clinical variables, indicating the value of information contained in the microarray features.",2015,"Genomics, Proteomics & Bioinformatics"
Linear Ranking for Linear Lasso Programs,"The general setting of this work is the constraint-based synthesis of termination arguments. We consider a restricted class of programs called lasso programs. The termination argument for a lasso program is a pair of a ranking function and an invariant. We present theâ€”to the best of our knowledgeâ€”first method to synthesize termination arguments for lasso programs that uses linear arithmetic.We prove a completeness theorem. The completeness theorem establishes that, even though we use only linear (as opposed to non-linear) constraint solving, we are able to compute termination arguments in several interesting cases. The key to our method lies in a constraint transformation that replaces a disjunction by a sum.",2013,

Modern and ancient olive stands near Sagalassos (southâ€west Turkey) and reconstruction of the ancient agricultural landscape in two valleys,"Aim To study the present-day olive stands and their ecology in the eastern part of the territory of the ancient city of Sagalassos, to study the variation of olive pollen production and dispersal near the olive stands, to establish a modern pollen reference model, and to compare Hellenisticâ€“Roman pollen data from two wetlands with this modern reference model. 
 
 
 
Location Eastern part of the territory of the ancient city of Sagalassos, western Taurus mountain range in south-west Turkey. 
 
 
 
Methods The study is based on field survey, pollen analysis of surface samples, multivariate statistics of modern pollen data and the use of â€˜modern analoguesâ€™ in comparison with Hellenisticâ€“Roman pollen samples. 
 
 
 
Results A field survey revealed the presence of 35 olive stands in the study area. These are mainly small-scale stands. The olive pollen representation in the surface samples is highly variable. Two groups of modern â€˜oliveâ€™ pollen spectra could be distinguished: (1) a group representing mainly olive stands from lush and moist mixed orchards; and (2) a group representing mainly olive stands from open small-scale olive stands in combination with annual crop agriculture. Although no â€˜perfectâ€™ modern analogue was found for the Hellenisticâ€“Roman pollen data, the fossil pollen data show similarities with modern spectra from the second group, due to the presence of relatively high pollen values for secondary anthropogenic indicators. 
 
 
 
Main conclusion A well-organized and diverse, but time- and energy-consuming, agricultural system was maintained nearby the wetlands of Canakli soils, presumably to maximize the yields in both valleys.",2003,Global Ecology and Biogeography
Lecture 5: Spatial probit models,"Probitmodelswithspatialdependencieswereï¬rststudiedbyMcMillen(1992), whereanEMalgorithm was developed to produce consistent (maximum likelihood) estimates for thesemodels. As noted by McMillen, such estimation procedures tend to rely on asymptoticproperties, and hence require large sample sizes for validity. An alternative hierarchicalBayesian approach to non-spatial probit models was introduced by Albert and Chib (1993)which is more computationally demanding, but provides a ï¬‚exible framework for modelingwith small sample sizes. LeSage (2000) ï¬rst proposed extending Albert and Chibâ€™s approachto models involving spatial dependencies, and Smith and LeSage (2001) extend the classof models that can be analyzed in this framework. They introduce an error structurethat involves an additive error speciï¬cation ï¬rst introduced by Besag, et al. (1991) andsubsequently employed by many authors (as for example in Gelman, et al. 1998). Smithand LeSage (2001) show that this approach allows both spatial dependencies and generalspatial heteroscedasticity to be treated simultaneously.",2004,

Opportunities and challenges of regression analysis for big data are investigated in the present article. Firstly, the main characteristics describing big data are identified and explained, and then potential challenges that arise in big data analytics are identified. According to the identified challenges, some methods used in the regression analysis for big data are proposed. These methods reduce the calculation burden and select variables that best describe the response variable, thus achieving sufficient statisti-cal accuracy and reducing costs and time of calculations. One of the main purposes of this article is to apply the methods for real data set. Simulation and real data regression models are formed and parameters are estimated using divided regression and regression based on leverage techniques. The LASSO and LARS regressions are used to select the best subset of variables. Finally, model diag-nostics, accuracy estimation and comparisons of results are performed.",2018,
LASSO penalised likelihood in high-dimensional contingency tables,"Abstract: We consider several least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) penalized likelihood approaches in high dimensional contingency tables and with hierarchical log-linear models. These include the proposal of a parametric, analytic, convex, approximation to the LASSO. We compare them with â€œclassicalâ€ stepwise search algorithms. The results show that both backwards elimination and forward selection algorithms select more parsimonious (i.e. sparser) models which are always hierarchical, unlike the competing LASSO techniques.",2011,
Genomic risk scores for juvenile idiopathic arthritis and its subtypes,"Aims: Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is an autoimmune disease and a common cause of chronic disability in children. Diagnosis of JIA is based purely on clinical symptoms, leading to treatment delays. Despite JIA having substantial heritability, the construction of genomic risk scores (GRSs) to aid or expedite diagnosis has not been assessed. Here, we generate GRSs for JIA and its subtypes and evaluate their performance. Methods: We examined three case/control cohorts (UK, US, and Australia) with genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes. We trained GRSs for JIA and its subtypes using lasso-penalised linear models in cross-validation on the UK cohort, and externally tested in the Australian and US cohorts. Results: The JIA GRS alone achieved cross-validated AUC=0.670 in the UK cohort and externally validated AUCs of 0.657 and 0.671 in US-based and Australian cohorts, respectively. In logistic regression of case/control status, the corresponding odds ratios per standard deviation (s.d.) of GRS were 1.831 [1.685-1.991] and 2.008 [1.731-2.345], and were unattenuated by adjustment for sex or the top 10 genetic principal components. Extending our analysis to JIA subtypes revealed that enthesitis-related JIA had both the longest time-to-referral and the subtype GRS with the strongest predictive capacity overall across datasets: AUCs 0.80 in UK; 0.83 Australian; 0.69 US-based. The particularly common oligoarthritis JIA subtype also had a subtype GRS outperformed those for JIA overall, with AUCs of 0.71, 0.75 and 0.77, respectively. Conclusions: A genomic risk score for JIA has potential to augment purely clinical JIA diagnosis protocols, prioritising higher-risk individuals for follow-up and treatment. Consistent with JIA heterogeneity, subtype-specific GRSs showed particularly high performance for enthesitis-related and oligoarthritis JIA.",2020,medRxiv
Letter to the editor,"Dear Sir While reading the online version of the Journal, my attention was caught by the article entitled â€˜â€˜Inguinal herniorrhaphy in womenâ€™â€™, which appeared on August 25, 2005. The authors M. Bay-Nielsen and H. Kehlet made the following statements: â€˜â€˜Inguinal hernias in women are relatively rare and an outcome in this specific subgroup has not been documented in the literatureâ€™â€™ and â€˜â€˜female inguinal herniorrhaphy is followed by a higher re-operation rate than in malesâ€™â€™. With reference to the first statement, I wish to point out that while sitting at my desk and within reach, without a literature search, I was able to pull out 12 references dealing with the issue of â€˜â€˜outcomeâ€™â€™ in women! These will be listed in the present bibliography. Considering a variable incidence of inguinal hernias in women of 8â€“16% [1], some readers may disagree with qualifying them as â€˜â€˜relatively rareâ€™â€™. With reference to the second statement, the results culled from the Danish Hernia Database do not reflect the most important criterion in recurrences, namely the diligence of the surgeon at identifying a hernia or finding additional ones at the original surgery [2]. Women rarely have direct inguinal hernias, 1.1% of all inguinal hernias [1] or 0.2% of all abdominal wall hernias [2], to be exact. They have indirect inguinal hernias and when the sac and repair have been correctly handled, there is no reason or cause for a recurrence. One is left to conclude that the majority of recurrences from the Database are overlooked or â€˜â€˜missed herniasâ€™â€™ as confirmed by Obney and Chan [3]. It is interesting that one of the largest studies which followed up 508 patients with femoral hernias revealed that women had a recurrence rate of 18% while men had an 82% incidence [3, 4]. At least in the hands of the Shouldice surgeons whose sole preoccupation is hernia surgery [3]. These statistics have been richly documented by Frank Glassow from1953 to1973 and supplemented by E. Ryan. I have long recognized the distinct nature of hernia disease in women and it is for this reason that I dedicated to them a special section in â€˜â€˜Abdominal Wall Herniasâ€™â€™ (chapters 88â€“93 inclusive) [Springer, 2001]. Many of our colleagues, I am sure, will concur with the points I have raised. I would like to emphasize also, that we have all been guilty on occasion of a less than sedulous search of our infinite literature on this topic of hernias.",2005,Hernia

"Choosing an appropriate alliance governance mode: The role of institutional, cultural and geographical distance in international research & development (R&D) collaborations","We identify a variety of R&D alliance modes in a knowledge-intensive industry (e.g., Pharmaceuticals), and classify them into four ordered categories which go beyond the traditional binary equity vs non-equity alliance classification. This enriches our understanding of alliance governance structures and broadens the application of alliance modes in what is today a more complicated international R&D collaboration setting. We then explore national, industry and firm factors that determine the selection of an appropriate R&D alliance governance mode, using a sample of 237 international alliance deals. The likelihood of using a more-integrated alliance governance mode decreases as the difference or â€œdistanceâ€ between nations of the partner firms increases in terms of human capital and cultural distance. On the other hand, a greater geographic and institutional difference is positively associated with the selection of more integrated alliance governance modes. Furthermore, firms in the research stage are more likely to use a more-integrated governance mode, as opposed to firms in the development stage. These findings advance research on alliance governance structure. They reveal the factors affecting the R&D alliance governance mode choice.AbstractNous identifions une variÃ©tÃ© de formes d'alliances de R&D dans un secteur Ã  forte intensitÃ© de connaissances (par exemple, le secteur pharmaceutique), et nous les classons en quatre catÃ©gories ordonnÃ©es qui vont au-delÃ  de la traditionnelle classification binaireÂ : alliances avec engagement capitalistique vs alliance sans engagement capitalistique.

Identifying Drivers of Genetically Modified Seafood Demand: Evidence from a Choice Experiment,"The aquaculture industry has expanded to fill the gap between plateauing wild seafood supply and growing consumer seafood demand. The use of genetic modification (GM) technology has been proposed to address sustainability concerns associated with current aquaculture practices, but GM seafood has proved controversial among both industry stakeholders and producers, especially with forthcoming GM disclosure requirements for food products in the United States. We conduct a choice experiment eliciting willingness-to-pay for salmon fillets with varying characteristics, including GM technology and GM feed. We then develop a predictive model of consumer choice using LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator)-regularization applied to a mixed logit, incorporating risk perception, ambiguity preference, and other behavioral measures as potential predictors. Our findings show that health and environmental risk perceptions, confidence and concern about potential health and environmental risks, subjective knowledge, and ambiguity aversion in the domain of GM foods are all significant predictors of salmon fillet choice. These results have important implications for marketing of foods utilizing novel food technologies. In particular, people familiar with GM technology are more likely to be open to consuming GM seafood or GM-fed seafood, and effective information interventions for consumers will include details about health and environmental risks associated with GM seafood.",2019,Sustainability
An Efficient Chemical Synthesis of Lassomycin Enabled by an On-Resin Lactamisationâ€“Off-Resin Methanolysis Strategy and Preparation of Chemical Variants,"An efficient synthesis of the naturally occurring cyclic peptide lassomycin that bears a unique Aspâ€“Gly isopeptide bond and a C-terminal methyl ester is described. On-resin cyclisation between 1Gly and side chain 8Asp and a subsequent solution-phase transesterification reaction afforded synthetic lassomycin in high yield. Several analogues were also prepared using the optimised methodology. None of the cyclised peptides, including the synthetic natural product, exhibited any significant activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Comparison of the spectroscopic data for synthetic lassomycin with naturally occurring lassomycin concluded they were otherwise identical.",2017,Australian Journal of Chemistry
Change-point Detection by the Quantile LASSO Method.,"A simultaneous change-point detection and estimation in a piece-wise constant model is a common task in modern statistics. If, in addition, the whole estimation can be performed automatically, in just one single step without going through any hypothesis tests for non-identifiable models, or unwieldy classical a-posterior methods, it becomes an interesting, but also challenging idea. In this paper we introduce the estimation method based on the quantile LASSO approach. Unlike standard LASSO approaches, our method does not rely on typical assumptions usually required for the model errors, such as sub-Gaussian or Normal distribution. The proposed quantile LASSO method can effectively handle heavy-tailed random error distributions, and, in general, it offers a more complex view of the data as one can obtain any conditional quantile of the target distribution, not just the conditional mean. It is proved that under some reasonable assumptions the number of change-points is not underestimated with probability tenting to one, and, in addition, when the number of change-points is estimated correctly, the change-point estimates provided by the quantile LASSO are consistent. Numerical simulations are used to demonstrate these results and to illustrate the empirical performance robust favor of the proposed quantile LASSO method.",2019,arXiv: Statistics Theory
Expected length of post-model-selection confidence intervals conditional on polyhedral constraints,"Valid inference after model selection is currently a very active area of research. The polyhedral method, pioneered by Lee et al. (2016), allows for valid inference after model selection if the model selection event can be described by polyhedral constraints. In that reference, the method is exemplified by constructing two valid confidence intervals when the Lasso estimator is used to select a model. We here study the expected length of these intervals. For one of these confidence intervals, that is easier to compute, we find that its expected length is always infinite. For the other of these confidence intervals, whose computation is more demanding, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for its expected length to be infinite. In simulations, we find that this condition is typically satisfied.",2018,arXiv: Statistics Theory

An application of a synchronous~reactive semantics to the vhdl language,"The goal of this project was to defineand demonstratea subsetof the VHDLlanguage[IEEE87] which is consistentwith the simulationsemanticsand yet has an interpretation as a specification. The subset shownin this work incorporatesas muchof the language as is possible without compromising its interpretation as a specification of systembehavior. Thereis no othersubsetof theVHDL language which can incorporate moreof thesemantics of the language, yetretainan inter pretation as a specification. Toshow why this is thelatges subset of theVHDL language which hasthis property, a review of some of themany uses ofVHDL isgiven along with anexplanation ofwhy theinterpretation ofthefull VHDL language asa specification within this context isproblematic atbest. Adefinition ofwhat it means tointerpret anexecutable description asa specification is given inthe form ofanexample ofanexisting class oflanguages, the reactive languages, which have this property: being executableyet havingan interpretation as a specification. The questionthen is whetherthereis a usefulsubsetof the VHDL language thatcanbeshown tobereactive. Infact, within thewide range of uses ofVHDL, there isa class ofuses thatcan be int^preted as a reactive specification. The identification of thisclassof uses, andtherestrictions on the lan guage structure that accompany it form the basis of the subset definition. Reactive systems, orequivalently synchronous systems, have the property that they respond toevents from theenviron ment inwhich they reside; nothing ofinterest outside these events and their responses occurs inthese systems. The formu lation ofthe definition ofreactive systems interms ofevents allows for asuccinct description oftheir behaviors as regular expressions. Hence the implementation ofa reactive system isnaturally interms ofone ofthe many finite automata which recognizes the regular language that defines the system's behavior. The goal ofthe subset definition then isto identify the reactive portion ofthe VHDL language, independent ofits language structures, so that the behaviorofprograms written in the subset may be interpreted as regular expressions, and implemented interms of(communicating) finite automata. The Synchronous VHDL subset presented here isderived through a restriction ontheabstract simulator that defines the meaning ofaVHDL program. The focus here is on restricting the simulator behavior and using that restriction to drive the definition of the VHDL subset, instead oftheother way around ashas been traditional in the definition ofother VHDL language subsets. The result ofthis work isadescription ofthe subset ofthe VHDL language that uses only finite-autom ata-like behavior, it thus has well-defined implementation as a network ofcommunicating finite state machines. In addition to the definition ofSynchronous VHDL, agoal ofthis project was to demonstrate the subset inuse. Thus, a major portion of this project was the implementation ofacompiler front-end which isused to analyze VHDL source text, converting firom the syntax ofthe language into a form suitable for compilation into areactive language.",1992,
"Microbial community composition of Tirez lagoon (Spain), a highly sulfated athalassohaline environment","BackgroundThe aim was to study the seasonal microbial diversity variations of an athalassohaline environment with a high concentration of sulfates in Tirez lagoon (La Mancha, Spain). Despite the interest in these types of environments there is scarce information about their microbial ecology, especially on their anoxic sediments.ResultsWe report the seasonal microbial diversity of the water column and the sediments of a highly sulfated lagoon using both molecular and conventional microbiological methods. Algae and Cyanobacteria were the main photosynthetic primary producers detected in the ecosystem in the rainy season. Also dinoflagelates and filamentous fungi were identified in the brines. The highest phylotype abundance in water and sediments corresponded to members of the bacterial phylum Proteobacteria, mainly of the Gamma- and Alphaproteobacteria classes. Firmicutes and Actinobacteria were isolated and identified in Tirez brines and sediment samples. Halophilic sulfate reducing Deltaproteobacteria were also detected (Desulfohalobium).ConclusionsImportant differences have been found in the microbial diversity present in the Tirez water column and the sediments between the wet and dry seasons. Also the Tirez lagoon showed a high richness of the bacterial Alpha- and Deltaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and for the archaeal Euryarchaeota.",2013,Aquatic Biosystems
Development and Validation of a Five-Gene Model to Predict Postoperative Brain Metastasis in Operable Lung Adenocarcinoma.,"One of the most common sites of extra-thoracic distant metastasis of non-small-cell lung cancer is the brain. This study was performed to discover genes associated with postoperative brain metastasis in operable lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). RNA seq was performed in specimens of primary LUAD from seven patients with brain metastases and 45 patients without recurrence. Immunohistochemical (IHC) assays of the differentially-expressed genes were conducted in 272 surgical-resected LUAD specimens. LASSO Cox regression was used to filter genes related to brain metastasis and construct brain metastasis score (BMS). GSE31210 and GSE50081 were used as validation datasets of the model. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis was performed in patients stratified by risk of brain metastasis in the TCGA database. Through the initial screening, eight genes (CDK1, KPNA2, KIF11, ASPM, CEP55, HJURP, TYMS, and TTK) were selected for IHC analyses. The BMS based on protein expression levels of five genes (TYMS, CDK1, HJURP, CEP55, and KIF11) was highly predictive of brain metastasis in our cohort (12-month AUC: 0.791, 36-month AUC: 0.766, 60-month AUC: 0.812). The validation of BMS on overall survival of GSE31210 and GSE50081 also showed excellent predictive value (GSE31210, 12-month AUC: 0.682, 36-month AUC: 0.713, 60-month AUC: 0.762; GSE50081, 12-month AUC: 0.706, 36-month AUC: 0.700, 60-month AUC: 0.724). Further analyses showed high BMS was associated with pathways of cell cycle and DNA repair. A 5-gene predictive model exhibits potential clinical utility for the prediction of postoperative brain metastasis and the individual management of patients with LUAD after radical resection.

Regression adjustment for treatment effect with multicollinearity in high dimensions,"Randomized experiment is an important tool for studying the Average Treatment Effect (ATE). This paper considers the regression adjustment estimation of the Sample Average Treatment Effect (SATE) in high-dimensional case, where the multicollinearity problem is often encountered and needs to be properly handled. Many existing regression adjustment methods fail to achieve satisfactory performances. To solve this issue, an Elastic-net adjusted estimator for SATE is proposed under the Rubin causal model of randomized experiments with multicollinearity in high dimensions. The asymptotic properties of the proposed SATE estimator are shown under some regularity conditions, and the asymptotic variance is proved to be not greater than that of the unadjusted estimator. Furthermore, Neyman-type conservative estimators for the asymptotic variance are proposed, which yields tighter confidence intervals than both the unadjusted and the Lasso-based adjusted estimators. Some simulation studies are carried out to show that the Elastic-net adjusted method is better in addressing collinearity problem than the existing methods. The advantages of our proposed method are also shown in analyzing the dataset of HER2 breast cancer patients.",2019,Comput. Stat. Data Anal.
Groups of roving midnight parrotfish (Scarus coelestinus) prey on sergeant major damselfish (Abudefduf saxatilis) nests,"Parrotfish are key herbivores on coral reefs that can exert strong top-down control on algae, yet their unique jaws allow them to feed on a wide variety of substrates, and many larger species are important bioeroders and invertebrate predators (Bonaldo et al. 2014). Like other species of large-bodied parrotfishes, midnight parrotfish (Scarus coelestinus) are relatively rare throughout much of their range, but can be locally abundant in places where they are not fished. Where abundant, midnight parrotfish often feed in large schools (often 30+ individuals), apparently to gain access to nutritious algae by overcoming the territorial defense of Bfarming^ damselfishes (Stegastes spp.) (Alevizon 1976). During June and July 2013 and 2014, we frequently encountered large groups of roving midnight parrotfish on high relief-reef spur-and-groove reefs in the upper Florida Keys (Adam et al. 2015). In addition to feeding on algae in Stegastes territories, on several occasions, we observed groups of midnight parrotfish raiding the nests of sergeant major damselfish (Abudefduf saxatilis) (Fig. 1; see also video and Table 1 in supplementary material). Approximately 15â€“25 midnight parrotfish would raid a nest, using their strong jaws to rapidly remove both eggs and the underlying substratum. Sergeant majors would initially try to defend their nests but were quickly overwhelmed. Raids typically lasted several minutes, and parrotfish were often joined by opportunistic egg predators (especially Thalassoma bifasciatum), which appeared unable to gain access to nests in the absence of midnight parrotfish. A mosaic of fresh and old bite scars inmany sergeant major nests indicated that egg predation by midnight parrotfish was",2016,Marine Biodiversity

Sparse Models and Methods for Optimal Instruments With an Application to Eminent Domain,"We develop results for the use of LASSO and Post-LASSO methods to form first-stage predictions and estimate optimal instruments in linear instrumental variables (IV) models with many instruments, p, that apply even when p is much larger than the sample size, n. We rigorously develop asymptotic distribution and inference theory for the resulting IV estimators and provide conditions under which these estimators are asymptotically oracle-efficient. In simulation experiments, the LASSO-based IV estimator with a data-driven penalty performs well compared to recently advocated many-instrument-robust procedures. In an empirical example dealing with the effect of judicial eminent domain decisions on economic outcomes, the LASSO-based IV estimator substantially reduces estimated standard errors allowing one to draw much more precise conclusions about the economic effects of these decisions. Optimal instruments are conditional expectations; and in developing the IV results, we also establish a series of new results for LASSO and Post-LASSO estimators of non-parametric conditional expectation functions which are of independent theoretical and practical interest. Specifically, we develop the asymptotic theory for these estimators that allows for non-Gaussian, heteroscedastic disturbances, which is important for econometric applications. By innovatively using moderate deviation theory for self-normalized sums, we provide convergence rates for these estimators that are as sharp as in the homoscedastic Gaussian case under the weak condition that log p = o(n 1/3). Moreover, as a practical innovation, we provide a fully data-driven method for choosing the user-specified penalty that must be provided in obtaining LASSO and Post-LASSO estimates and establish its asymptotic validity under non-Gaussian, heteroscedastic disturbances.",2010,Econometrica
The role of Kefalovruso and Amourio springs in the hydrodynamic conditions of Potamia Elassona basin,"Two lignite deposits have been found in the Neogene basin of Potamia, located in Elassona area in central Greece. The water resources of the region affect critically the exploitation of the mineral deposits. The detailed hydrogeological research of the area is imperative before starting the mining activities. Two groups of springs discharge near the study area. The karstic springs of Kefalovruso are in the northwest boundaries of the Neogene basin and the springs of Amourio are located in the Quaternary alluvial deposits, in the central part of the area. This paper includes the analysis of the hydrogeological conditions of the springs, the processing of the water- measurements (water supply, water level) and their correlation with the area's meteorological data. The time series of hydrological data, from 1972 to 2008, were evaluated for both springs and several parameters were estimated in order to investigate the function and the capacity of the springs. The relation between the recharge system of the springs and the area's groundwater dynamics is also analysed.",2013,
"Upper Triassic Miers Bluff Formation of the Livingston Island,Antarctica and its Stratigraphical Correlations with Adjacent Areas","The Miers Bluff Formation (MBF), cropping out at Hurd Peninsula on Livingston Island, consists mainly of greywacks, mudstones, siltstones and pebbly mudstones, attaining a thickness of about 3000 m. The strongly deformed and low graded metasedimentary sequences are interpreted to be turbidite deposits of submarine fan. It is composed of, in ascending order, the Johnsons Dock Member, the Napier Peak Member and possibly the Moores Peak breccias. The age of the formation is poorly constrained ranging from late Paleozoic to early Mesozoic due to lack of identifiable fossils. Plant microfossils have been found from the MBF, including a total of about 45 species (forma) referred to 37 genera of miospores. The sporadic occurrence of Aratrisporites and Classopollis as well as the absence of bisaccate striatiti indicates that the age of the MBF should not be older than Noirian and possibly ranges from Norian to Rhaetian. Abundant organic matter including rich wood fragments (tracheids) in the MBF appears to show that the sedimentary site was not far apart from the land. The luxuriant parentflora with diverse pteridophytes seems to indicate a warm and humid climate. The MBF may be synchronous with those turbidite sequences represented by such formations as the Hope Bay, the Paradise Harbour and the Cape Legoupil of the Antarctic Peninsula and the Greywake Shale of South Orkney Islands, the Portranca Formation in Chile as well as the upper Torlesse Complex in New Zealand. All of these might have been contemporaneously deposited under similar tectonic style just prior to the break up of Gondwana in earlier Jurassic times.",2000,Journal of stratigraphy
MRI radiomic features are associated with survival in melanoma brain metastases treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors.,"BACKGROUND
Melanoma brain metastases historically portend a dismal prognosis, but recent advances in immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have been associated with durable responses in some patients. There are no validated imaging biomarkers associated with outcomes in patients with melanoma brain metastases receiving ICIs. We hypothesized that radiomic analysis of magnetic resonance images (MRIs) could identify higher-order features associated with survival.


METHODS
Between 2010 and 2019, we retrospectively reviewed patients with melanoma brain metastases who received ICI. After volumes of interest were drawn, several texture and edge descriptors, including first-order, Haralick, Gabor, Sobel, and Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) features were extracted. Progression was determined using Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Brain Metastases. Univariate Cox regression was performed for each radiomic feature with adjustment for multiple comparisons followed by Lasso regression and multivariate analysis.


RESULTS
Eighty-eight patients with 196 total brain metastases were identified. Median age was 63.5 years (range, 19-91 y). Ninety percent of patients had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 and 35% had elevated lactate dehydrogenase. Sixty-three patients (72%) received ipilimumab, 11 patients (13%) received programmed cell death protein 1 blockade, and 14 patients (16%) received nivolumab plus ipilimumab. Multiple features were associated with increased overall survival (OS), and LoG edge features best explained the variation in outcome (hazard ratio: 0.68, P = 0.001). In multivariate analysis, a similar trend with LoG was seen, but no longer significant with OS. Findings were confirmed in an independent cohort.


CONCLUSION
Higher-order MRI radiomic features in patients with melanoma brain metastases receiving ICI were associated with a trend toward improved OS.",2019,Neuro-oncology

The article introduces the concept of the Russian language derivational-associative dictionary. The article deals with a new associative dictionary project which treats the word as a text unit, a language system unit and a language consciousness one. Such an approach is connected with the idea of L.V. Shcherba that language facts can be treated in three aspects language system, language material and speech activity. The article proves that this unity is expressed in derivational associations, which create special contexts called ''derivational contexts''. For example, Ñ Ð½Ðµ Ð±Ð¾ÑŽÑÑŒ, Ñ‡Ñ‚Ð¾ Ð¼ÐµÐ½Ñ ÐºÑ‚Ð¾-Ñ‚Ð¾ ÑƒÐ´Ð°Ñ€Ð¸Ñ‚.

Such contexts have the role of stimuli in the associative-derivational experiment. During this experiment respondents fill in gaps in a derivational context, the gaps being focuses of derivation (perspective direction) or motivation (retrospective direction). The results of filling in the gaps create association fields, which make up the basic content of the derivational-associative dictionary article.

Building variable selection ensembles for linear regression models by adding noise,"Ensemble learning techniques have been proven to be useful to improve the performance of traditional variable selection methods such as the lasso, the genetic algorithm, and the stepwise search. Following the main principle of the building methods for variable selection ensembles, we propose a novel approach by adding noise to the response variable so that the selection accuracy is maximized. In order to generate multiple but slightly different importance measures for each variable, Gaussian noises are artificially added to the response. The new training set (i.e, the original design matrix together with the new response vector) is then used as the input of the genetic algorithm to perform the variable selection. By repeating this process for a number of iterations and fusing the results by simple averaging, the variables are ranked and a thresholding rule is then employed to identify the important variables. The performance of the proposed method is studied on simulated data sets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method yields better performance than several other methods.",2015,2015 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics (ICMLC)
Variable Selection for Censored Quantile Regresion.,"Quantile regression has emerged as a powerful tool in survival analysis as it directly links the quantiles of patients' survival times to their demographic and genomic profiles, facilitating the identification of important prognostic factors. In view of limited work on variable selection in the context, we develop a new adaptive-lasso-based variable selection procedure for quantile regression with censored outcomes. To account for random censoring for data with multivariate covariates, we employ the ideas of redistribution-of-mass and e ective dimension reduction. Asymptotically our procedure enjoys the model selection consistency, that is, identifying the true model with probability tending to one. Moreover, as opposed to the existing methods, our new proposal requires fewer assumptions, leading to more accurate variable selection. The analysis of a real cancer clinical trial demonstrates that our procedure can identify and distinguish important factors associated with patient sub-populations characterized by short or long survivals, which is of particular interest to oncologists.",2013,Statistica Sinica
Analysis of Spectral Clustering and the Lasso under Nonstandard Statistical Models,"Advances in information technology have provided businesses, governments, and the sciences novel tools to collect and store data. These new technologies produce data that does not always fit within the classical statistical paradigm: several independent and identically distributed samples from a distribution with a few parameters. Instead, the modern data sources often contain dependent samples, with several agents that interact, e.g. social networks. In some situations, the number of parameters far exceeds the number of samples, e.g. experiments with fMRI. To create knowledge from these new data sources requires fresh statistical tools and novel theoretical insights. This dissertation uses nonstandard statistical models to study the theoretical properties of three estimators that confront two modern types of data, network data and high dimensional data. Networks or graphs can easily represent a diverse set of data sources that are characterized by interacting units or actors. Social networks, representing people who communicate with each other, are one example. Communities or clusters of highly connected actors form an essential feature in the structure of several empirical networks. Spectral clustering is a popular and computationally feasible method to discover these communities in undirected networks. Chapter 2 uses the Stochastic Blockmodel [Holland et al., 1983], a social network model with well defined communities, to study the estimation properties of the spectral clustering algorithm. For a network generated from the Stochastic Blockmodel, we bound the number of nodes ``misclustered by spectral clustering. The asymptotic results in Chapter 2 are the first clustering results that allow the number of clusters in the model to grow with the number of nodes, hence the name high-dimensional. Chapter 2 addresses clustering in undirected networks, where relationships do not have a direction. However, in some networks, such as the predator-prey network, relationships point from one actor to another (e.g. from predator to prey). Chapter 3 extends the spectral clustering algorithm and the Stochastic Blockmodel to directed graphs. The new algorithm, Di-Sim (pronounced ``dice `em ) produces two distinct types of clusters, one corresponding to incoming edges and another corresponding to outgoing edges. The new Directed Stochastic Blockmodel provides a test bed to conceptualize these two types of clusters. This new model also allows for a theoretical investigation of Di-Sim's asymptotic properties. While directed spectral clustering is not derived from this model, it is shown that, asymptotically, the algorithm can estimate the blocks in the directed Stochastic Blockmodel.Finally, Chapter 4 investigates the sign consistency of the Lasso under a heteroskedastic, ``Poisson-like regression model. The performance of the Lasso is well understood under the assumptions of the standard linear model with homoscedastic noise. However, in several applications, the standard model does not describe the important features of the data. Chapter 4 examines how the Lasso performs on a non-standard model that is motivated by medical imaging applications. In these applications, the variance of the noise scales linearly with the expectation of the observation. Like all heteroscedastic models, the noise terms in this Poisson-like model are not independent of the design matrix.",2011,
Estimating High-Dimensional Regression Models with Bootstrap Group Penalties,"Currently many research problems are addressed by analysing datasets characterized by a huge number of variables, with a relatively limited number of observations, especially when data are generated by experimentation. Most of the classical statistical procedures for regression analysis are often inadequate to deal with such datasets as they have been developed assuming that the number of observations is larger than the number of the variables. In this work, we propose a new penalization procedure for variable selection in regression models based on Bootstrap group Penalties (BgP). This new family of penalization methods extends the bootstrap version of the LASSO approach by taking into account the grouping structure that may be present or introduced in the model. We develop a simulation study to compare the performance of this new approach with respect several existing group penalization methods in terms of both prediction accuracy and variable selection quality. The results achieved in this study show that the new procedure outperforms the other penalties procedures considered.",2017,

The Redistributive Design of Social Security Systems by J .,"Countries with low intragenerational redistribution in social security systems (Bismarckian) are associated with larger public pension expenditures, a smaller fraction of private pension and lower income inequality than countries with more redistributive social security (Beveridgean). This paper introduces a bidimensional voting model to account for these features. Agents different in age, income and in their ability to invest in the capital market vote on the degree of redistribution of the social security system and on the size of the transfer. In an economy with three income groups, a small Beveridgean system is supported by low-income agents, who gain from its redistributive feature, and high-income individuals, who seek to minimize their tax contribution and to invest in a private scheme. Middle-income individuals instead favor a large Bismarckian system. PAYG social security systems are at the centre of public sector expenditures in OECD countries. Although traditionally high, the attention of both economists âˆ—A previous version of this paper circulated under the title â€˜What Social Security: Beveridgean or Bismarckian?â€™ as w.p.at Universitat Pompeu Fabra, FEDEA and The Pension Institute.

All remaining errors are ours. and policy-makers towards pension systems has even increased recently under the pressure of the aging process. The current debate focuses on the role of public versus private pension provisions, the implications of demographic dynamics for the future of PAYG systems, the impact of different benefits on income inequality, redistribution and old age poverty. PAYG social security systems may involve different types of redistribution, across generations, i.e. from young to old, and within the same generation across different income levels, typically from rich to poor. OECD public pension programs differ in their degree of within-cohort redistribution (see Disney, 2004 and OECD, 2005). What are generally identified as â€˜Bismarckianâ€™ schemes feature a tight link between individualâ€™s contributions and pension benefits (France, Germany and Italy1). In these countries, pensionâ€™s replacement rates are similar, and generally high, across individuals of all income levels. Since contributions tend to be proportional to earnings, the social security system does not redistribute within-cohort. Countries with Bismarckian systems typically feature high pension spending and low income inequality. In â€˜Beveridgeanâ€™ schemes instead, public pension benefits are only loosely linked to contributions, with lower replacement rates for higher than for lower earners. Thus, these systems redistribute withincohort.2 This outcome may be reached under alternative schemes: in Australia benefits are income-tested and financed from general tax revenues, in Netherlands and New Zealand benefits are flat, in Canada, Ireland, Japan, Switzerland and UK a two-tier or multi-pillar system combines flat and earnings-related benefits, in the US benefits are highly non-linear in income. 1The recent introduction in Italy, Poland and Sweden of notional accounts defined contribution public pension scheme has strengthened this link between contributions and benefits. 2Notice that we focus on PAYG and we abstract from fully-funded pension systems. Our terminology identifies as â€˜Beveridgeanâ€™ a pension program that entails high redistribution (as in Casamatta et al.2000a, b; Disney, 2004); yet in the original Beveridge report flat benefits were designed to be financed by flat contributions. See section 2 for a detailed classification.",2007,
Reward-related neural activity and structure predict future substance use in dysregulated youth.,"BACKGROUND
Identifying youth who may engage in future substance use could facilitate early identification of substance use disorder vulnerability. We aimed to identify biomarkers that predicted future substance use in psychiatrically un-well youth.


METHOD
LASSO regression for variable selection was used to predict substance use 24.3 months after neuroimaging assessment in 73 behaviorally and emotionally dysregulated youth aged 13.9 (s.d. = 2.0) years, 30 female, from three clinical sites in the Longitudinal Assessment of Manic Symptoms (LAMS) study. Predictor variables included neural activity during a reward task, cortical thickness, and clinical and demographic variables.


RESULTS
Future substance use was associated with higher left middle prefrontal cortex activity, lower left ventral anterior insula activity, thicker caudal anterior cingulate cortex, higher depression and lower mania scores, not using antipsychotic medication, more parental stress, older age. This combination of variables explained 60.4% of the variance in future substance use, and accurately classified 83.6%.


CONCLUSIONS
These variables explained a large proportion of the variance, were useful classifiers of future substance use, and showed the value of combining multiple domains to provide a comprehensive understanding of substance use development. This may be a step toward identifying neural measures that can identify future substance use disorder risk, and act as targets for therapeutic interventions.",2017,Psychological medicine
Selecting Sensitive Parameter Subsets in Dynamical Models With Application to Biomechanical System Identification.,"Estimating many parameters of biomechanical systems with limited data may achieve good fit but may also increase 95% confidence intervals in parameter estimates. This results in poor identifiability in the estimation problem. Therefore, we propose a novel method to select sensitive biomechanical model parameters that should be estimated, while fixing the remaining parameters to values obtained from preliminary estimation. Our method relies on identifying the parameters to which the measurement output is most sensitive. The proposed method is based on the Fisher information matrix (FIM). It was compared against the nonlinear least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method to guide modelers on the pros and cons of our FIM method. We present an application identifying a biomechanical parametric model of a head position-tracking task for ten human subjects. Using measured data, our method (1) reduced model complexity by only requiring five out of twelve parameters to be estimated, (2) significantly reduced parameter 95% confidence intervals by up to 89% of the original confidence interval, (3) maintained goodness of fit measured by variance accounted for (VAF) at 82%, (4) reduced computation time, where our FIM method was 164 times faster than the LASSO method, and (5) selected similar sensitive parameters to the LASSO method, where three out of five selected sensitive parameters were shared by FIM and LASSO methods.",2018,Journal of biomechanical engineering
Optical sensor for noncontact measurement of lignin content in high-speed moving paper surfaces,"An optical sensor for real-time measurement of lignin content in moving paper sheets is described in this paper. The sensor is useful for high-speed automated sorting of papers according to lignin content in a mixed-waste stream for efficient recycling. The sensor measures lignin fluorescence when excited in the visible region. Results indicate that when paper surfaces are excited with a laser source (532 nm), the lignin fluorescence spectrum shows a peak near 650 nm. Measurement of this peak intensity from paper samples is a measure of lignin content and correlates linearly with the standard chemical method for lignin determination (Klasson lignin content). Newsprint samples, typically containing high lignin, produce high intensity, while ledger printing and writing grades with low lignin content produce low-fluorescence intensity. The proposed sensor configuration is discussed and results from a systematic study of variables, namely, text printed on surface, homogeneous dyed in color, printed color patches, paper thickness, sensor configuration parameters such as excitation source intensity, and distance from sample surface are reported. In dynamic tests on a simulated conveyor operating at realistic speeds, the sensor is able to reliably measure fluorescence intensities on unprinted samples without ambiguity and identify high and low lignin-containing samples.",2005,IEEE Sensors Journal
Relaxed Earth Mover's Distances for Chain- and Tree-connected Spaces and their use as a Loss Function in Deep Learning,"The Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) computes the optimal cost of transforming one distribution into another, given a known transport metric between them. In deep learning, the EMD loss allows us to embed information during training about the output space structure like hierarchical or semantic relations. This helps in achieving better output smoothness and generalization. However EMD is computationally expensive.Moreover, solving EMD optimization problems usually require complex techniques like lasso. These properties limit the applicability of EMD-based approaches in large scale machine learning. 
We address in this work the difficulties facing incorporation of EMD-based loss in deep learning frameworks. Additionally, we provide insight and novel solutions on how to integrate such loss function in training deep neural networks. Specifically, we make three main contributions: (i) we provide an in-depth analysis of the fastest state-of-the-art EMD algorithm (Sinkhorn Distance) and discuss its limitations in deep learning scenarios. (ii) we derive fast and numerically stable closed-form solutions for the EMD gradient in output spaces with chain- and tree- connectivity; and (iii) we propose a relaxed form of the EMD gradient with equivalent computational complexity but faster convergence rate. We support our claims with experiments on real datasets. In a restricted data setting on the ImageNet dataset, we train a model to classify 1000 categories using 50K images, and demonstrate that our relaxed EMD loss achieves better Top-1 accuracy than the cross entropy loss. Overall, we show that our relaxed EMD loss criterion is a powerful asset for deep learning in the small data regime.",2016,ArXiv

Learning LASSO Regularized and Time-Aware Continuous Convolution Operator Correlation Filter for Visual Tracking,"Discriminant correlation filters (DCF) have proven to perform well in visual tracking. However, the underlying discriminant correlation filter only utilizes the single-resolution features of the image block, which limits the performance of its algorithm. And there is still a problem with the existing DCF, that is, the degradation of the filter over time. The continuous convolution operator filter (C-COT) uses implicit interpolation to combine multi-resolution features to construct learning problems in a continuous domain. This efficiently integrates multi-resolution depth feature maps to solve the problem of targeting on the different resolution features. In order to improve the above problems, based on the continuous convolution operator filter (C-COT), the filter is LASSO regularized and adaptive spatial feature selection can be realized, and the filter maintains a certain sparsity, and secondly A time-aware optimization term is added to the objective function so that the learned filter can learn near its historical value to maintain the global structure of the feature. In order to make the learned filter anti-occlusion, this paper adopts a high confidence update strategy to avoid the model being polluted. The algorithm in this paper is called LASSO regularized time-aware continuous convolution operator filter (LTCOT). The algorithm can not only combine the effective features of multi-resolution, but also make the learning filter fully smooth transition between two frames and have certain sparsity, and has stronger discriminative power and anti-interference ability. The video in the OTBIOO database was used for testing with OPE (one pass evaluation), the area under the success line (AUC), average overlap accuracy (OP), and center pixel error distance (DP). The results show that the LTCOT algorithmâ€™s AUC score on the OTBIOO dataset is 2.4% higher than C-COT, OP is 85.9%, better than C-COT(81.4%), and DP is 90.1%, which is better than 89.3% of C-COT. At the same time, LTCOTâ€™s speed is six times higher than C-COT. The LTCOT algorithm can adapt to the visual tracking of complex situations such as occlusion, rotation and deformation, and has good robustness and accuracy.",2019,2019 IEEE 1st International Conference on Civil Aviation Safety and Information Technology (ICCASIT)
Treatment of Idiopathic Membranous Glomerulopathy,"The management of idiopathic membranous glomerulopathy (IMG) continues to be wrapped in controversy despite the fact that it is histologically one of the best defined glomerular diseases. This parodox was recently emphasized by Glassock1 who proposed that the disease entity of IMG is very likely the common morphological expression of several diseases, which may have different responses to therapy, ostensibly related to different specific etiologies and pathogenetic processes. Until the specific etiology in each patient with IMG is recognized, it is likely that the therapy of this disease entity will remain essentially empirical.",1985,
The junctura lasso: correction of extensor tendon displacement.,"Recurrent volar displacement of the extensor digitorum communis tendon (EDC) at the metacarpophalangeal joint (MCPJ) more commonly occurs post-trauma or in the rheumatoid hand. This disabling condition of the hand results in painful swelling of the MCPJ, associated with ""locking"" of the extensor tendon. We report a simple surgical technique used to successfully 'secure' the EDC from recurrent displacement. This was performed for a 59-year-old man who developed the condition in his ring finger, following Vth ray amputation for severe Dupuytren's disease. First, the EDC over the IIIrd and IVth MCPJ are exposed using a longitudinal incision. The junctura tendinum between the EDC tendons was next extended proximally by 2 cm on the radial side of the IVth EDC and then divided to create a distally based junctura slip. Next, a 'lasso' was created by passing the slip beneath the IVth EDC tendon and then securing it onto itself with a 5/0 Ethibond suture (Ethicon Inc.). This reconstruction was then tested in all ranges of MCPJ flexion, successfully preventing volar displacement of the extensor tendon. The 'junctura lasso' provided a satisfactory solution for the patient, who, over the next four years; for the duration of his follow-up, suffered no further displacement of the extensor tendon.",2013,"Journal of plastic, reconstructive & aesthetic surgery : JPRAS"

Iteratively Reweighted 1 Approaches to Sparse,"Motivated by the observation that a given signal x admits sparse representations in multiple dictionaries Î¨d but with varying levels of sparsity across dictionaries, we propose two new algorithms for the reconstruction of (approximately) sparse signals from noisy linear measurements. Our first algo- rithm, Co-L1, extends the well-known lasso algorithm from the L1 regularizer Î¨x1 to composite regularizers of the form d Î»dÎ¨dx1 while self-adjusting the regularization weights Î»d. Our second algorithm, Co-IRW-L1, extends the well-known iteratively reweighted L1 algorithm to the same family of com- posite regularizers. We provide several interpretations of both algorithms: 1) majorization-minimization (MM) applied to a non- convex log-sum-type penalty; 2) MM applied to an approximate ï¿½ 0-type penalty; 3) MM applied to Bayesian MAP inference under a particular hierarchical prior; and 4) variational expectation maximization (VEM) under a particular prior with determin- istic unknown parameters. A detailed numerical study suggests that our proposed algorithms yield significantly improved recov- ery SNR when compared to their noncomposite L1 and IRW-L1 counterparts.",2015,
Multipurpose Lasso,"Nowadays, L1 penalized likelihood has absorbed a high amount of consideration due to its simplicity and well developed theoretical properties. This method is known as a reliable method in order to apply in a broad range of applications including high-dimensional cases. On the other hand, L1 driven methods, precisely lasso dependent regularizations, suffer the loss of sparsity when the number of observations is too low. In this paper we address a new differentiable approximation of lasso that can produce the same results as lasso and ridge and also can produce smooth results. We prove the theoretical properties of the model as well as its computation complexity. Due to differentiability, proposed method can be implemented by means of the majority of convex optimization methods in literature. That means a higher accuracy in situations where true coefficients are close to zero that is a major issue of LARS. Simulation study as well as flexibility of the method show that the proposed approach is as reliable as lass and ridge and can be used in both situations.",2015,
Researches on the poison-apparatus in the actiniadae,"The organs which have been termed ""thread-cells,"" ""thread-capsules,"" ""urticating organs,"" ""lasso-cells,"" &c., I propose to call cnidae. They are found in various tissues of the body, but are specially localized in two sets of organs, which I call craspeda and acontia. The craspeda are gelatinous cords connected throughout their length with the free edges of the muscular septa. The acontia are somewhat similar cords, but free throughout, except at their base, where they are inserted into the septa. The cord-like appearance of these latter organs is, however, illusory, as each is a narrow ribbon with involute margins. Both the craspeda and the acontia are composed of a clear plasma, in which many cnidae are crowded.",1859,Proceedings of the Royal Society of London

Relative plaque-forming, cell-infecting, and interfering qualities of vaccinia virus. J. Bacteriol. 88:433-439. 1964.-The growth of vaccinia virus in slant cultures of L cells inoculated with different multiplicities of counted particles suggests a higher incidence of cell infection than can be accounted for by the number of plaque-forming units. From cultures containing antiserum or heated virus to limit the passage of progeny to uninfected cells, the data clearly indicate the ability of all the particles to infect cells even though the plaque titer is only one-tenth of this number. Analogous experiments show that an average of two heat-inactivated (56 C, 45 min) particles induce interference in L cells. There is nothing yet to show whether the few plaque-forming particles are different from the majority or whether they are just statistically fortunate in the complex process of plaque formation.",1964,Journal of bacteriology
Pellagra: epidemiological and clinical features in the western region of Burkina Faso,"Introduction: Pellagra is a deficiency of vitamin PP which include nicotinic acid or niacine and nicotinamide. It is yet frequent in our country. The purpose of this study was to describe the epidemiological and clinical features of pellagra in the Western region of Burkina Faso. Patients and Methods: It was a retrospective, descriptive survey led through patients admitted in dermatology and psychiatry departments of Bobo-Dioulasso, from 2005 to 2012. Results: During this period, pellagra was diagnosed in 223 patients with a mean age of 37.7 + 17.2 years (range: six to 85 years) and a sex-ratio of 1/3. The cases were registered in rural as well as urban areas of the western region of Burkina Faso. It concerned mainly women (76.7%), especially the house-wife (47.1%). Cutaneous, ulcerous forms represented 6.3% of the cases, neurologic signs were 62% and chronic diarrhea was 6.5%. Three patients died (1.3%). Conclusion: This survey showed that pellagra is frequent, affecting mainly women of western region of Burkina Faso where the maize constitutes the basic cereal in the peopleâ€™s diet. Ulcerous forms could cause mistake in the diagnosis. Sensibilization of the population is essential to prevent this affection.

Joint Structural Estimation of Multiple Graphical Models,"Gaussian graphical models capture dependence relationships between random variables through the pattern of nonzero elements in the corresponding inverse covariance matrices. To date, there has been a large body of literature on both computational methods and analytical results on the estimation of a single graphical model. However, in many application domains, one has to estimate several related graphical models, a problem that has also received attention in the literature. The available approaches usually assume that all graphical models are globally related. On the other hand, in many settings different relationships between subsets of the node sets exist between different graphical models. We develop methodology that jointly estimates multiple Gaussian graphical models, assuming that there exists prior information on how they are structurally related. For many applications, such information is available from external data sources. The proposed method consists of first applying neighborhood selection with a group lasso penalty to obtain edge sets of the graphs, and a maximum likelihood refit for estimating the nonzero entries in the inverse covariance matrices.

Fast Adaptive Hinging Hyperplanes,"This paper proposes a fast algorithm for the training of adaptive hinging hyperplanes (AHH), which is a popular and effective continuous piecewise affine (CPWA) model consisting of a linear combination of basis functions. The original AHH incrementally generates new basis functions by simply traversing all the existing basis functions in each dimension with the pre-given knots. Meanwhile, it also incorporates a backward procedure to delete redundant basis functions, which avoids over-fitting. In this paper, we accelerate the procedure of AHH in generating new basis functions, and the backward deletion is replaced with Lasso regularization, which is robust, requires less computation, and manages to prevent over-fitting. Besides, the selection of the splitting knots based on training data is also discussed. Numerical experiments show that the proposed algorithm significantly improves the efficiency of the existing AHH algorithm even with higher accuracy and it also enhances robustness in the given benchmark problems.",2018,2018 IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)
Soft Tissue Sarcomas: Preoperative Predictive Histopathological Grading Based on Radiomics of MRI.,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES
The purpose of this study is to develop a radiomics model for predicting the histopathological grades of soft tissue sarcomas preoperatively through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Thirty-five patients who were pathologically diagnosed with soft tissue sarcomas and their histological grades were recruited. All patients had undergone MRI before surgery on a 3.0T MRI scanner. Radiomics features were extracted from fat-suppressed T2-weighted imaging. We used the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression method to select features. Then three machine learning classification methods, including random forests, k-nearest neighbor, and support vector machine algorithm were trained using the 5-fold cross validation strategy to separate the soft tissue sarcomas with low- and high-histopathological grades.


RESULTS
The radiomics features were significantly associated with the histopathological grades. Quantitative imaging features (nâ€¯=â€¯1049) were extracted from fat-suppressed T2-weighted imaging, and five features were selected to construct the radiomics model. The model that used support vector machine classification method achieved the best performance among the three methods, with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves Area Under Curve (AUC) values of 0.92 Â± 0.07, accuracy of 0.88.


CONCLUSION
Good accuracy and AUC could be obtained using only five radiomic features. Therefore, we proposed that three-dimensional imaging features from fat-suppressed T2-weighted imaging could be used as candidate biomarkers for preoperative prediction of histopathological grades of soft tissue sarcomas noninvasively.",2018,Academic radiology
IMRT QA using machine learning: A multiâ€institutional validation,"PURPOSE
To validate a machine learning approach to Virtual intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) quality assurance (QA) for accurately predicting gamma passing rates using different measurement approaches at different institutions.


METHODS
A Virtual IMRT QA framework was previously developed using a machine learning algorithm based on 498 IMRT plans, in which QA measurements were performed using diode-array detectors and a 3%local/3 mm with 10% threshold at Institution 1. An independent set of 139 IMRT measurements from a different institution, Institution 2, with QA data based on portal dosimetry using the same gamma index, was used to test the mathematical framework. Only pixels with â‰¥10% of the maximum calibrated units (CU) or dose were included in the comparison. Plans were characterized by 90 different complexity metrics. A weighted poison regression with Lasso regularization was trained to predict passing rates using the complexity metrics as input.


RESULTS
The methodology predicted passing rates within 3% accuracy for all composite plans measured using diode-array detectors at Institution 1, and within 3.5% for 120 of 139 plans using portal dosimetry measurements performed on a per-beam basis at Institution 2. The remaining measurements (19) had large areas of low CU, where portal dosimetry has a larger disagreement with the calculated dose and as such, the failure was expected. These beams need further modeling in the treatment planning system to correct the under-response in low-dose regions. Important features selected by Lasso to predict gamma passing rates were as follows: complete irradiated area outline (CIAO), jaw position, fraction of MLC leafs with gaps smaller than 20 or 5 mm, fraction of area receiving less than 50% of the total CU, fraction of the area receiving dose from penumbra, weighted average irregularity factor, and duty cycle.


CONCLUSIONS
We have demonstrated that Virtual IMRT QA can predict passing rates using different measurement techniques and across multiple institutions. Prediction of QA passing rates can have profound implications on the current IMRT process.",2017,Journal of Applied Clinical Medical Physics
Allassogonoporus callosciuri n. sp. (Digenea: Allassogonoporidae) from the plantain squirrel Callosciurus notatus (Boddaert) (Rodentia: Sciuridae) in Borneo,"A new digenean, Allassogonoporus callosciuri n. sp. from the plantain squirrel Callosciurus notatus from the Malaysian state of Sarawak, Borneo, is described. The new species differs from: A. amphoraeformis by the size of the ventral sucker and the position of the vitellarium and uterus; and from A. marginalis by the smaller oral sucker, the position of the testes and vitellarium; from A. vespertilionis by the position of the vitellarium, testes and ovary; from A. asymmetrica by the position of the testes and uterus. Gilford's (1955) and Dubois' (1963) opinions on the synonymy of Allassogonoporus and Myotitrema is supported. No representatives of the family Allassogonoporidae have been reported previously from sciurids or South-East Asia.",2004,Systematic Parasitology

You are not dreaming, you are drifting into sleep. You are feeling veeeerrry sleepy now. The curvature of the earth is causing you to shift away from the pinpoint that you circled yesterday on a map, your eyes hazed. That was also a today, in a novel fashionâ€”the today of days long gone, of clouds long transformed into rain, or else snow drifts. Thatâ€™s okay, you know this: in cathedrals of bone we find arcs that keep us warm. In drift- wood we find the puzzles that madden us all night, Tetris dreaming. In from our past, deriving steam, straight lines, axes, branches, kindling. Attention! Does anyone here speak Spanish? Si? Bueno! Dream with me. Cry out in your sleep. Step fearfully out onto the ice and drift awhile, inside a massive Perspex speech-bubble dream. A massive bubble longing to become detergent. The louvres of a ribcage snapping shut. Awe. Curvature of the earth is a con job: ask a dervish. Hail an imaginary cab in a hail-struck avenue and wait for the popcorn to drop. Stop, drifter! In the pharmacies and in the alleys, popping rocks while money men drift by in stockings, purling and unfurling their ways, their means. Attention, people! Abstraction hurts. Reading too much into things I know nothing about, the niceness of the void or else a philosopherâ€™s mouth sewn shut. I know about that, at least: the madness of seeking asylum in antipodean dreams, drifting for weeks at a time on a boat more abstract than surreal. Oh, fuck Life of Pi! Heaven basks like a warm, square meal but I canâ€™t get there from here. There is no shark travelling at speed X while I zoom at speed Y in the opposite direction. I canâ€™t use a lasso. I no longer have fits. I am no, mad. Too bad. Attention! Ambient doom slash moon. Over! The curvature of a yawn, a dream sewn shut. This skin, that knows my dreams, forgets me. Fruit tingles, wet on the tongue: get me some analogue hits, expressways to frozen, lakeside moon-dream voiceovers. The narratorâ€™s cues infuse the afternoon, the canoes, with nostalgia. Somewhere, out there, we become driftories. We lie down in atoms and the clinamina bore. We fight against our own handwritten lies, type marching letters into files and save. Awe. Fidelity is a kind of surveillance. Current A. Attention! It was never my intention to score cheap points at the expense of polar bears, of driftwood, shores. The cockatoos roar. Their explosive chatter could strip a pine tree raw. Implant in me some destructive grace, to drift. Planetoid lamps all along the turnpikeâ€™s busy arcs. Extreme emissions of things. Drift-rings. The target of my gaze, sewn shut. Your eyes rising slower than a star from what you read, condensed into steam, here, north of all music. Driftories, signal fires, smoke: disappear. Go back to sleep now. No, we were never here.",2013,Continent
Fully Bayesian logistic regression with hyper-LASSO priors for high-dimensional feature selection,"ABSTRACT Feature selection arises in many areas of modern science. For example, in genomic research, we want to find the genes that can be used to separate tissues of different classes (e.g. cancer and normal). One approach is to fit regression/classification models with certain penalization. In the past decade, hyper-LASSO penalization (priors) have received increasing attention in the literature. However, fully Bayesian methods that use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for regression/classification with hyper-LASSO priors are still in lack of development. In this paper, we introduce an MCMC method for learning multinomial logistic regression with hyper-LASSO priors. Our MCMC algorithm uses Hamiltonian Monte Carlo in a restricted Gibbs sampling framework. We have used simulation studies and real data to demonstrate the superior performance of hyper-LASSO priors compared to LASSO, and to investigate the issues of choosing heaviness and scale of hyper-LASSO priors.",2014,Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation
