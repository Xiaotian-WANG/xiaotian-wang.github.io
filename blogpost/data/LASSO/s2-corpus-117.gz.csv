Improving LASSO performance for Grey Leaf Spot disease resistance prediction based on genotypic data by considering all possible two-way SNP interactions.,"Disease resistance prediction using genotypic data has been widely pursued in animal as well as plant research, mostly in cases where genotypic data can be readily available for a large number of subjects. With the evolution of SNP marker genotyping technology and the consequent cost reduction for genotyping thousands of SNP markers, significant research effort is being undertaken in the statistics and machine learning community to perform efficient analysis of these multidimensional datasets. For large plant breeding programs, besides identifying biomarkers associated with disease resistance, developing accurate predictive models of the phenotype based on the genotype alone is one of the most relevant scientific goals, as it allows for efficient selection without having to grow and phenotype every individual. While the importance of interactions for understanding diseases has been shown in many studies, the majority of the existing methods are limited by considering each biomarker as an independent variable, completely ignoring complex interactions among biomarkers. In this study, logistic regression p-value, Pearson correlation and mutual information were calculated for all two-way SNP interactions with respect to the Grey Leaf Spot (GLS) disease resistance phenotype. These interactions were subsequently ranked based on these measures and the performance of the LASSO algorithm for GLS disease resistance prediction was then shown to be maximized by adding the top 10â€‰000 two-way interactions from the logistic regression p-value based rank. The logistic regression p-value based rank also led to an error rate of more than 3 percentual points lower than not adding any interaction and more than 3.5 percentual points lower than adding interactions chosen at random.",2012,Integrative biology : quantitative biosciences from nano to macro
A temporary self-expanding metallic stent for malignant colorectal obstruction.,"AIM
To investigate the clinical safety and efficacy of a temporary self-expanding metallic stent (SEMS) for malignant colorectal obstruction.


METHODS
From September 2007 to June 2012, 33 patients with malignant colorectal obstruction were treated with a temporary SEMS. The stent had a tubular configuration with a retrieval lasso attached inside the proximal end of the stent to facilitate its removal. The SEMS was removed one week after placement. Clinical examination, abdominal X-ray and a contrast study were prospectively performed and both initial and follow-up data before and at 1 d, 1 wk, and 1 mo, 3 mo, 6 mo and 12 mo after stent placement were obtained. Data collected on the technical and clinical success of the procedures, complications, need for reinsertion and survival were analyzed.


RESULTS
Stent placement and removal were technically successful in all patients with no procedure-related complications. Post-procedural complications included stent migration (n = 2) and anal pain (n = 2). Clinical success was achieved in 31 (93.9%) of 33 patients with resolution of bowel obstruction within 3 d of stent removal. Eleven of the 33 patients died 73.81 Â± 23.66 d (range 42-121 d) after removal of the stent without colonic re-obstruction. Clinical success was achieved in another 8 patients without symptoms of obstruction during the follow-up period. Reinsertion of the stent was performed in the remaining 12 patients with re-obstruction after 84.33 Â± 51.80 d of follow-up. The mean and median periods of relief of obstructive symptoms were 97.25 Â± 9.56 d and 105 Â± 17.43 d, respectively, using Kaplan-Meier analysis.


CONCLUSION
Temporary SEMS is a safe and effective approach in patients with malignant colorectal obstruction due to low complication rates and good medium-term outcomes.",2013,World journal of gastroenterology
Abstract 3113: Hyperactivation of FOXM1 drives ovarian cancer growth and metastasis independent of the G2-M cell cycle checkpoint.,"Forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) is a TP53- and phosphorylation-dependent transcription factor that plays a critical role in cell cycle progression. Recent analyses by the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) consortium indicate that FOXM1 overexpression may be a key, early event driving the growth of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). However, this hypothesis has not been critically tested. Using RT-qPCR, we examined the expression of each of the known FOXM1 splice variants. We found that levels of FOXM1c but not FOXM1b or the translationally inactive FOXM1a are significantly higher in specimens of EOC (n=5) than normal ovary (n=3) or fallopian tube (n=3). By western blot, we found that FOXM1 is highly phosphorylated in EOC, suggesting that its hyperactivation is a consistent feature of ovarian cancer. When FOXM1 expression was targeted in TP53-wt HEYA8, TP53-mutated OVCAR8, and TP53-deficient SkOViP31 ovarian cancer cells by siRNAs, we found that ovarian cancer cell lines with reduced FOXM1 expression grow much more slowly than control cultures transfected with a non-targeting siRNA control and that a loss of FOXM1 results in G2-M cell cycle arrest that can be detected by flow cytometry using propidium iodide stained cells. Reduced FOXM1 expression also inhibited migration and invasion when OVCAR8 and HeyA8 cells were evaluated using standard Boyden chamber assays. Using qPCR and Western blot, we examined the ability of FOXM1 to directly regulate >19 gene products that are highly expressed in EOC. Despite the fact that FOXM1 regulates many of these genes (Cyclin B1, Plk1, and CENPF) in other cells and tissues, levels of their expression were not observed when FOXM1 was knocked down SKOV3ip1, HEY8 and OVCAR8 cells. Therefore, we analyzed patterns of gene expression from 581 TCGA ovarian cancer specimens using serial linear regression with L1 normalization (Lasso analysis) to test for correlations with FOXM1 expression. These analyses identified multiple gene products whose expression is potentially regulated by FOXM1 in ovarian cancer. Altered levels of expression for multiple gene products identified by these analyses have been examined by qPCR and Western blot in ovarian cancer cell lines transfected with shRNA targeting FOXM1 expression. These included multiple gene products, including VEGF-B and -C known to regulate angiogenesis. To explore the in vivo impact of targeting FOXM1 expression, a xenograft model was established by inoculating Fox1Nu mice with OVCAR8 cells stably transfected with either shRNA targeting FOXM1 and a non-targeting control. Collectively, these results indicate that hyperactivation of FOX1-mediated transcriptional activity is a consistent feature of EOC and plays a critical role in regulating ovarian cancer metastasis in addition to proliferation. FOXM1 may be a valuable therapeutic target for overcoming the genetic heterogeneity that limits current ovarian cancer treatments. Citation Format: Triparna Ghosh-Choudhury, Holli A.

"Improving Data Collection on Fathers: Comments on Methods and Measurement Papers, National Fatherhood Forum","University of MarylandThe papers by West, Mitchell, and colleagues, andby Roy and Kwon address which aspects offathers and fathering are important to exploreand how to conduct research on them. I wouldlike, first, to reiterate why it is that we are inter-ested in devoting time to examining fathers andfathering. I believe that it is because men whoare in close contact with children make contribu-tions to their well being, for good or bad, and thatthe more we know about the contributions menmake to children, the better we understand theirchildrenâ€™s own transitions to fatherhood andsubsequent fathering behavior.Jerry West identifies four key challenges: (1)defining fathers, (2) identifying appropriate mento interview, (3) locating and gaining cooperation,and (4) developing appropriate measures of father-ing to use. I agree that these are the key issues toaddress.Defining FathersThe answer to the question Jerry West asksabout which fathers to include and which not toinclude is simple. Include those men with whomchildren have either a biological or a residentialassociation. This would mean the biological father(residential or nonresidential) and the residentialstepfather or father figure, if any. Recent researchsuggests that stepfathers are important men inchildrenâ€™s lives and should be included (Marsiglio,2004). Many biological fathers leave and have noor minimal contact with children; including suchdads would not add information about fathering.Most research also includes adoptive parents asparents; they have agreed to act as natural parentsand should be treated as such. Foster parentsshould probably not be included, but only a verysmall fraction of children are in such settings.Identifying Appropriate Men to InterviewJerry Westâ€™s second question is how to deter-mine which men should be studied. To do so weneed to make sure to obtain sufficient data on bio-logical and marital relationships and contact=involvement. By asking questions about amountof contact of the biological father, any residentialfather, and other possible father figures with thechild, we can determine which men are involvedin childrenâ€™s lives. Collect data from all relevantmen and let the researcher determine how to usethe data. Researchers with an interest in biologicalfatherhood will focus on biological fathers, resi-dent or not, and those with an interest in residen-tial fatherhood will focus on residential fathers,stepfathers, and other father figures. Asking aboutboth, as was done in the National LongitudinalSurvey of Youth (1979), provides more flexibilityfor researchers. Another important considerationis from whom to ask the questions. It seems thatobtaining reports from mothers, fathers, and chil-dren is critical. These different family membershave different points of view that contribute tothe overall picture. The NLSY-79 asked childrenabout their fathers, asked mothers about chil-drenâ€™s fathers, and recently began asking fathersthemselves about their relations with children.Locating and Obtaining CooperationLocating and obtaining cooperation fromfathers is a very tough task at the moment. TheMitchell et al. paper provides a sobering descrip-tion of the difficulties of obtaining cooperation.Many of the fathers in whom we are interestedare working several jobs and juggling one or sev-eral families. They have little time to talk withresearchers. We need to think harder and morecreatively about the types of incentives that wouldencourage fathers to participate. Providing struc-tured time with children, paid babysitting, learningopportunities for fathers and child, and substantialfinancial incentives are some ideas.",2007,Applied Developmental Science
"A Siamese Embassy Lost in Africa, 1686: The Odyssey of Ok-Khun Chamnan","This long-forgotten tale of the shipwreck off the coast of Africa of a Siamese embassy to Lisbon in 1686 lay buried in the text of a French book printed 300 years ago. The author of the text was the intrepid and intriguing Jesuit Tachard, who published accounts of his first two journeys to Siam. In his second book, written when he was King Narai's personal envoy to Louis XIV and Pope Innocent XI, Tachard relates the account of the shipwreck as told by one of its survivors, Ok-khun Chamnan Chaicong, who was accompanying Tachard on his return to France. Ok-khun Chamnan, during his odyssey as part of the aborted embassy to Portugal, spent nearly a year in Goa, where he learned Portuguese; a month traveling overland from Cape Agulhas, the southernmost tip of Africa, to the Cape of Good Hope; four months at the Dutch settlement at the Cape; six months in Batavia; and several months at sea. On his return to Siam in 1687 he was ordered to greet the French envoys La Loubere and Seberet soon after their arrival. The adventures of this Siamese khunnang did not end with his unsuccessful journey to Lisbon. He went on to Europe in 1688, visited the Riviera and Rome in winter, met the pope, and then in 1689 had an audience with Louis XIV. He converted to Catholicism and returned from Europe in 1690, disembarking at Balassor in Bengal before returning to Ayutthaya overland from Mergui. This extraordinary account has been translated into English for the first time, and is accompanied by three contemporary texts by Choisy, Tachard, and La Loubere describing the Dutch settlement at the Cape.",2000,
[Neurologic manifestations associated with HIV infections at the Bobo-Dioulasso Hospital Center (Burkina Faso)].,"Neurological manifestations of HIV infection are frequent and diverse. Diagnosis is often difficult due to geographical factors. 686 of the 3409 patients admitted to the Internal Medicine ward of Bobo-Dioulasso in 1995-1996 were HIV seropositive. This represents a prevalence of 20.1%. The sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of 101 patients with neurological problems during the study period are reported in this paper. This case series represents 14% of the HIV-positive admissions. The mean age was 35.7 years and 43% of the cases were aged 30 to 40 years. Sex-ratio was 1.6 male for 1 female. Focal deficits were observed in 36 of cases. Peripheral neuropathy (37%), meningitis or meningoencephalitis (20%), fitting (8%) and myelitis (8%) were the other clinical presentations. The etiology of the focal deficits was not ascertained because of the lack of tomodensitometry, specific serology and necropsy. Any neurological manifestation in a HIV seropositive patient should prompt investigations in order to diagnose those infections which can be treated, especially Toxoplasma gondii abscess and Cryptococcus neoformans meningitis.",1999,Bulletin de la Societe de pathologie exotique
Detection and quantification in real-time polymerase chain reaction,"The estimation of the concentration of an infectious agent in the environment is a key step to trigger an alert when there is a biological threat. This concentration can be obtained trough a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Nevertheless, standard real-time procedure do not address detection delay which is a main concern in alert triggering. Therefore, we propose a method based on Lasso regression and CUSUM change detection to accurately estimate the concentration while minimizing the detection delay. The trade-off between accuracy and delay can be managed through a parameter. We compare our results with those found by a standard method (threshold method) and promising results are obtained.",2013,

Modified SCAD penalty for constrained variable selection problems,"Abstract Instead of using sample information only to do variable selection, in this article we also take priori information â€” linear constraints of regression coefficients â€” into account. The penalized likelihood estimation method is adopted. However under constraints, it is not guaranteed that information criteria like AIC and BIC are minimized at an oracle solution using the lasso or SCAD penalty. To overcome such difficulties, a modified SCAD penalty is proposed. The definitions of information criteria GCV, AIC and BIC for constrained variable selection problems are also proposed. Statistically, we show that if the tuning parameter is appropriately chosen, the proposed estimators enjoy the oracle properties and satisfy the linear constraints. Additionally, they also possess the robust property to outliers if the linear model with M-estimation is used.",2014,Statistical Methodology

New insights into Early Celtic consumption practices: Organic residue analyses of local and imported pottery from Vix-Mont Lassois,"The rich Mediterranean imports found in Early Celtic princely sites (7th-5th cent. BC) in Southwestern Germany, Switzerland and Eastern France have long been the focus of archaeological and public interest. Consumption practices, particularly in the context of feasting, played a major role in Early Celtic life and imported ceramic vessels have consequently been interpreted as an attempt by the elite to imitate Mediterranean wine feasting. Here we present the first scientific study carried out to elucidate the use of Mediterranean imports in Early Celtic Central Europe and their local ceramic counterparts through organic residue analyses of 99 vessels from Vix-Mont Lassois, a key Early Celtic site. In the Mediterranean imports we identified imported plant oils and grape wine, and evidence points towards appropriation of these foreign vessels. Both Greek and local wares served for drinking grape wine and other plant-based fermented beverage(s). A wide variety of animal and plant by-products (e.g. fats, oils, waxes, resin) were also identified. Using an integrative approach, we show the importance of beehive products, millet and bacteriohopanoid beverage(s) in Early Celtic drinking practices. We highlight activities related to biomaterial transformation and show intra-site and status-related differences in consumption practices and/or beverage processing.",2019,PLoS ONE
Spain retains its title and sets a new record â€“ generalized linear mixed models on European football championships,"Abstract Nowadays many approaches that analyze and predict the results of football matches are based on bookmakersâ€™ ratings. It is commonly accepted that the models used by the bookmakers contain a lot of expertise as the bookmakersâ€™ profits and losses depend on the performance of their models. One objective of this article is to analyze the role of bookmakersâ€™ odds together with many additional, potentially influental covariates with respect to a national teamâ€™s success at European football championships and especially to detect covariates, which are able to explain parts of the information covered by the odds. Therefore a pairwise Poisson model for the number of goals scored by national teams competing in European football championship matches is used. Moreover, the generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) approach, which is a widely used tool for modeling cluster data, allows to incorporate team-specific random effects. Two different approaches to the fitting of GLMMs incorporating variable selection are used, subset selection as well as a Lasso-type technique, including an L1-penalty term that enforces variable selection and shrinkage simultaneously. Based on the two preceeding European football championships a sparse model is obtained that is used to predict all matches of the current tournament resulting in a possible course of the European football championship (EURO) 2012.",2013,
Testing Significance of Features by Lassoed Principal Components.,"We consider the problem of testing the significance of features in high-dimensional settings. In particular, we test for differentially-expressed genes in a microarray experiment. We wish to identify genes that are associated with some type of outcome, such as survival time or cancer type. We propose a new procedure, called Lassoed Principal Components (LPC), that builds upon existing methods and can provide a sizable improvement. For instance, in the case of two-class data, a standard (albeit simple) approach might be to compute a two-sample t-statistic for each gene. The LPC method involves projecting these conventional gene scores onto the eigenvectors of the gene expression data covariance matrix and then applying an L(1) penalty in order to de-noise the resulting projections. We present a theoretical framework under which LPC is the logical choice for identifying significant genes, and we show that LPC can provide a marked reduction in false discovery rates over the conventional methods on both real and simulated data. Moreover, this flexible procedure can be applied to a variety of types of data and can be used to improve many existing methods for the identification of significant features.",2008,The annals of applied statistics
A critical review of the environmental impact assessment system in South Africa based on case studies and a literature review.,"This study represents a review of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) system in South Africa based on case studies. It takes the form of two separate but interrelated components. Component A sets out the rationale for the research, the approach and objectives, a conceptual framework and a statement of methodology. These aspects are supported by a detailed literature review. It is stated as the broad rationale of the research to determine whether the current EIA system can be improved. This is approached through an update on EIA reviews. It is not only the intention of the review to fill an existing gap in literature on the subject, but also to provide findings and recommendations on procedure that may positively contribute to the system and by implication, the process of EIA in South Africa. Certain objectives are realised in the literature review. An understanding of the review process in the context of EIA in South Africa is provided in sections on relevant terminology, the history and status quo of environmental assessment in South Africa as well as local and international experiences. Finally a framework is proposed for purposes of review. In order to ensure international relevance this framework uses as its basis the international best practice review criteria of Glasson, Therivel and Chadwick (1999) and Fuller (1999). This basis is amalgamated and extended with local review criteria contained in the White Paper on Environmental Management Policy, July 1997, the Guideline Document on EIA RegUlations, April 1998 and the Integrated Environmental Management Information Series (20022004). The following review categories are used: Description of the environment; screening, scoping, consultation and impact identification; prediction and evaluation of impacts; mitigation and monitoring; non-technical summary; organisation and interpretation of information and the appropriateness of institutional controls. Ratings are allocated according to five different responses (non-compliance, low compliance, moderate compliance, high compliance and full compliance).",2006,
Simultaneous Coefficient Penalization and Model Selection in Geographically Weighted Regression: The Geographically Weighted Lasso,"In the field of spatial analysis, the interest of some researchers in modeling relationships between variables locally has led to the development of regression models with spatially varying coefficients. One such model that has been widely applied is geographically weighted regression (GWR). In the application of GWR, marginal inference on the spatial pattern of regression coefficients is often of interest, as is, less typically, prediction and estimation of the response variable. Empirical research and simulation studies have demonstrated that local correlation in explanatory variables can lead to estimated regression coefficients in GWR that are strongly correlated and, hence, problematic for inference on relationships between variables. The author introduces a penalized form of GWR, called the â€˜geographically weighted lassoâ€™ (GWL) which adds a constraint on the magnitude of the estimated regression coefficients to limit the effects of explanatory-variable correlation. The GWL also performs local model selection by potentially shrinking some of the estimated regression coefficients to zero in some locations of the study area. Two versions of the GWL are introduced: one designed to improve prediction of the response variable, and one more oriented toward constraining regression coefficients for inference. The results of applying the GWL to simulated and real datasets show that this method stabilizes regression coefficients in the presence of collinearity and produces lower prediction and estimation error of the response variable than does GWR and another constrained version of GWRâ€”geographically weighted ridge regression.",2009,Environment and Planning A
Identifying miRNA-mRNA regulatory relationships in breast cancer with invariant causal prediction,"BackgroundmicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level and they play an important role in various biological processes in the human body. Therefore, identifying their regulation mechanisms is essential for the diagnostics and therapeutics for a wide range of diseases. There have been a large number of researches which use gene expression profiles to resolve this problem. However, the current methods have their own limitations. Some of them only identify the correlation of miRNA and mRNA expression levels instead of the causal or regulatory relationships while others infer the causality but with a high computational complexity. To overcome these issues, in this study, we propose a method to identify miRNA-mRNA regulatory relationships in breast cancer using the invariant causal prediction. The key idea of invariant causal prediction is that the cause miRNAs of their target mRNAs are the ones which have persistent causal relationships with the target mRNAs across different environments.ResultsIn this research, we aim to find miRNA targets which are consistent across different breast cancer subtypes. Thus, first of all, we apply the Pam50 method to categorize BRCA samples into different ""environment"" groups based on different cancer subtypes. Then we use the invariant causal prediction method to find miRNA-mRNA regulatory relationships across subtypes. We validate the results with the miRNA-transfected experimental data and the results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we also integrate this new method with the Pearson correlation analysis method and Lasso in an ensemble method to take the advantages of these methods. We then validate the results of the ensemble method with the experimentally confirmed data and the ensemble method shows the best performance, even comparing to the proposed causal method.ConclusionsThis research found miRNA targets which are consistent across different breast cancer subtypes. Further functional enrichment analysis shows that miRNAs involved in the regulatory relationships predicated by the proposed methods tend to synergistically regulate target genes, indicating the usefulness of these methods, and the identified miRNA targets could be used in the design of wet-lab experiments to discover the causes of breast cancer.",2019,BMC Bioinformatics
Opportunities and limitations in teaching forest resource continuing education : experiences with southern bottomland hardwood workshops and shortcourses (an update),"Continuing education workshops and shortcourses are playing an increasingly important role in the education of forest resource professionals. The â€œtug-of-warâ€ between breadth and depth in undergraduate curricula, combined with pressure to reduce the number of credit hours required for graduation, create knowledge gaps in various disciplines. Workshops and shortcourses help to fill this gap by providing up-to-date information on specific topics pertinent to maintaining professional competence as well as professional registration or certification. We discuss the opportunities and limitations of teaching continuing education courses, especially those with a heavy field emphasis, based on our experiences with the hardwood workshop series taught by faculty at Mississippi State University (MSU) and colleagues. The key to developing a workshop or shortcourse is organization and preparation. In this paper, we review the planning process and conduct in the MSU hardwood workshops. Introduction Adult continuing education plays a critical role in forest resources education (Skean and Scragg 1994). Undergraduate curricula are undergoing constant change in response to perceived societal expectations (Brown and Lassoie 1998, Tombaugh 1998, Sample et al. 1999). Past curricula emphasized depth in technical subjects. Todayâ€™s curricula emphasize greater breadth of a broader array of subjects at the expense of depth. In reality, we need both a breadth of subjects and depth in particular subjects to develop competent forest resource professionals, but we simply do not have the available credit hours to teach both concurrently (Robison 2005). Legislative mandates may limit the number of credit hours required for graduation. For example, 120 hours has been proposed as the maximum number of credit hours for an undergraduate degree in Arkansas (the current forestry degree in the School of Forest Resources, 2 University of Arkansas Monticello requires 136 credit hours). These proposed credit hour maximums are placing additional pressure on changing curricula. Professional continuing education workshops and shortcourses fill voids from undergraduate curricula. For example, most southern forestry programs still place a heavy emphasis on southern pine management with little emphasis on hardwood management. A long-running series of hardwood workshops taught by Mississippi State University (MSU) helps fill this void. Continuing education workshops and shortcourses, in addition to providing important information to participants, also provide continuing education credits that are necessary to maintain professional registration or certification. For example, Mississippi requires 16 hours of continuing forestry education credits every two years to maintain forester registration in the state, Arkansas requires 15 hours each year, and Georgia and Alabama require 10 and 12 hours, respectively, every two years. The Society of American Foresters requires 60 hours over a threeyear period to maintain Certified ForesterÂ® status. Finally, continuing education workshops and shortcourses provide participants with the opportunity to learn the latest technological advances or new processes and procedures. Recent advances in computer technology, especially geographical information systems (GIS) and global positioning systems (GPS), have resulted in many shortcourses in these areas. The objectives of this paper are to list and discuss opportunities and limitations in teaching professional continuing education courses that have a heavy field emphasis. We relate these through our experiences in teaching southern bottomland hardwood workshops and shortcourses. For purposes of this paper we distinguish between a workshop and a shortcourse. A workshop is a continuing education endeavor in which participants are exposed to relatively brief, to-the-point lectures on specific techniques and considerable hands-on experience in the field (forest), e.g., review a hardwood reproduction evaluation model in the classroom followed by collection of reproduction evaluation data, data entry, and analysis in the field or computer laboratory. A shortcourse is a continuing education endeavor in which participants are exposed to longer lectures that include theoretical and ecological background, i.e., the principles behind silvicultural practices and field techniques. Field experiences consist primarily of show-and-tell stops. In essence, a shortcourse is as the name implies â€“ a shorten version of an actual college course. In reality, most forest resource workshops and shortcourses contain elements of each other, although the focus is on one or the other. Mississippi State University Hardwood Workshops A series of hardwood workshops offered through MSU was initiated in 1980 following several meetings between hardwood resource managers and MSU faculty and administrators. A one-page proposal, developed by Dr. John Hodges, stated that the objectives of these workshops would be â€œto give on-the-ground instruction and training in hardwood management, with emphasis on the latest research findings and on techniques which have been successful under operational conditions.â€ These endeavors would be â€œdesigned to give the greatest possible amount of field exposureâ€ with â€œ1-to-3 hours each day devoted to lectures/discussions and that the remainder of the day will be spent in the field observing and/or participating in silvicultural/management operations. As much variety as possible, in terms of sites and 3 approaches to a problem, will be covered. Emphasis in the courses will be on participation and interaction with the instructors. For that reason, enrollment will be limited to 15-20 participants.â€ The result from these meetings was the following series of hardwood workshops: (1) natural regeneration, (2) artificial regeneration, (3) management of existing stands, (4) growth and yield, and (5) economics of hardwood management. To date, about 40 of these hardwood workshops have been taught by MSU faculty and guest instructors, averaging one to two per year. Additionally, MSU faculty have been requested to teach hardwood workshops on-site at locations throughout the southern United States. The influence of these workshops and shortcourses has been passed on to former graduate students from the MSU hardwood program, who carry on the emphasis of these continuing education endeavors with their own hardwood workshops and shortcourses, most notably at the University of Tennessee, University of Georgia, Louisiana State University, and the U.S. Forest Service. Although an exact count of the number of hardwood workshops and shortcourses taught since 1980 has been lost over time, it is estimated that about 75 have been taught either directly or indirectly by MSU faculty and former graduate students. Planning Process The key to developing a continuing education endeavor, especially one with a heavy field emphasis, is organization and preparation.",2008,
Graph Learning & Fast Transform Coding of 3D River Data,"Collection of physical river measurements across space and time is important towards analysis and prediction of dynamic river flow, and thus early warning and prevention of flood disaster. In this paper, we focus on lossy compression of 3D river data at high quality using predictive graph-based transforms. Specifically, we first divide 3-dimensional river data into non-overlapping temporal frame groups. Data in a frame group $t$ is then predicted using frame group $t-1$, assuming strong temporal correlation. Then for each block in a frame in group $t$, we learn a sparse inverse covariance matrix from a spatial neighborhood of blocks in the previous frame group via a graphical lasso algorithm with structural constraints. The learned matrix is then interpreted as a graph Laplacian, and graph lifting transform (GLT) or fast graph Fourier transform (FGFT) are employed to encode the prediction residuals efficiently. Experimental results show coding performance gain over conventional DCT and competing graph transform schemes without graph learning.",2018,2018 Asia-Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference (APSIPA ASC)

Carbonate Precipitation of Bacterial Strains Isolated from Sediments and Seawater: Formation Mechanisms,"This article presents a research study on carbonate formation in solid and liquid media by Thalassospira sp., Halomonas sp., Bacillus pumilus, and Pseudomonas grimontii, four bacterial strains isolated from sediments and deep seawater. As part of this study, we analyzed carbonic anhydrase activity, pH, adsorption of calcium and magnesium ions, and total organic and inorganic carbon. The geochemical program PHREEQC was also used to calculate the mineral saturation indexes in all the cultures. The minerals formed were studied with X-ray diffraction, X-ray dispersive energy microanalysis, and scanning electron microscopy. In addition, all four bacterial strains were found to induce carbonate precipitation and to have carbonic anhydrase activity. Sterile control experiments did not precipitate carbonate. In solid M1 and B4 media, all of the strains precipitated magnesium calcite, whereas in the liquid media, they precipitated different percentages of magnesium calcite, aragonite, and monohydrocalcite. In both cases, small amounts of amorphous precipitates were also produced. This article discusses carbonate formation and the possible role played by metabolic activity, bacterial surfaces and carbonic anhydrase in this process. Finally, the results obtained lead to a hypothesis regarding the importance of carbonate precipitation for the survival of bacteria populations in certain habitats.",2013,Geomicrobiology Journal

Transcriptional regulation of secondary cell wall biosynthesis in Miscanthus sinensis,"Cell wall recalcitrance is a major limitation hindering the exploitation of the enormous potential of lignocellulosic biomass as a renewable resource for energy and bio-based products. In the last decades, C4 grasses from the genus Miscanthus have emerged as a most promising energy crop for the production of lignocellulosic biomass in temperate 
climates. Secondary cell walls, which represent the largest proportion of lignocellulosic biomass are formed in specialised cells after cessation of growth. In higher plants, the formation of secondary cell walls is tightly regulated, both spatially and temporally, by a complex network of transcription factors. However, in Miscanthus only little is known about molecular players regulating secondary cell wall formation and lignin biosynthesis. 
In this study, application of the herbicide isoxaben was shown to trigger ectopic lignification in Miscanthus seedling roots. The chemical treatment may be exploited in the future to identify regulators and biosynthetic genes involved in lignification in Miscanthus. 
In addition, Miscanthus sinensis transcription factors related to SECONDARY WALLASSOCIATED NAC DOMAIN1 (SND1) and SECONDARY CELLWALL MYBs 1-4 (SCM1-4) were identified in the Miscanthus transcriptome, which act as regulators of secondary cell wall formation and lignin biosynthesis. During Miscanthus development, expression of MsSND1 and MsSCMs coincided with the onset of secondary cell wall formation and lignification of vascular tissue and sclerenchyma fibers. MsSND1 and MsVND7 were capable 
to fully restore growth in a SCW-deficient Arabidopsis thaliana mutant, suggesting they are the Miscanthus orthologues of the well characterised Arabidopsis determinants of SCW formation in fibers and vessels. Ectopic expression of MsSND1 and MsVND7 in tobacco leaves prompted the formation of patterned deposition of lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose reminiscent of xylem elements. This observation was in sharp contrast to uniform lignification after transient expression of various MsSCMs. Expression of particular Miscanthus TFs led to specific cell wall compositions, providing attractive targets for biomass improvements. Transgenic Arabidopsis lines carrying an inducible system of MsSND1 revealed that MsSND1 regulates directly or indirectly the expression of a broad range of genes involved in secondary cell wall formation.",2018,
Weighted-LASSO for Structured Network Inference from Time Course Data,We present a weighted-LASSO method to infer the parameters of a first-order vector auto-regressive model that describes time course expression data generated by directed gene-to-gene regulation networks. These networks are assumed to own prior internal structures of connectivity which drive the inference method. This prior structure can be either derived from prior biological knowledge or inferred by the method itself. We illustrate the performance of this structure-based penalization both on synthetic data and on two canonical regulatory networks (the yeast cell cycle regulation network and the E. coli S.O.S. DNA repair network).,2010,Statistical Applications in Genetics and Molecular Biology
Distinguished minimal toplogical lassos,"A classical result in distance based tree-reconstruction characterizes when for a distance $D$ on some finite set $X$ there exist a uniquely determined dendrogram on $X$ (essentially a rooted tree $T=(V,E)$ with leaf set $X$ and no degree two vertices but possibly the root and an edge weighting $\omega:E\to \mathbb R_{\geq 0}$) such that the distance $D_{(T,\omega)}$ induced by $(T,\omega)$ on $X$ is $D$. Moreover, algorithms that quickly reconstruct $(T,\omega)$ from $D$ in this case are known. However in many areas where dendrograms are being constructed such as Computational Biology not all distances on $X$ are always available implying that the sought after dendrogram need not be uniquely determined anymore by the available distances with regards to topology of the underlying tree, edge-weighting, or both. To better understand the structural properties a set $\cL\subseteq {X\choose 2}$ has to satisfy to overcome this problem, various types of lassos have been introduced. Here, we focus on the question of when a lasso uniquely determines the topology of a dendrogram's underlying tree, that is, it is a topological lasso for that tree. We show that any set-inclusion minimal topological lasso for such a tree $T$ can be transformed into a 'distinguished' minimal topological lasso $\cL$ for $T$, that is, the graph $(X,\cL)$ is a claw-free block graph. Furthermore, we characterize such lassos in terms of the novel concept of a cluster marker map for $T$ and present results concerning the heritability of such lassos in the context of the subtree and supertree problems.",2013,arXiv: Populations and Evolution
Childhood Tuberculosis in Sub-saharan Africa,"Objective: Tuberculosis remains a public health problem in Burkina Faso and sub-Saharan Africa.The purpose of this study was to describe epidemiological, clinical and para-clinical aspects of childhood tuberculosis in sub-saharan hospital settings. Methods: It was a cross-sectional study of new cases of tuberculosis diagnosed between 1st January 2016 and 31st December 2016 in the pediatric department of Bobo-Dioulasso University Hospital (Burkina Faso). Results: The study included twenty eight (28) children with an average age of 8.3 years. The main part of patients (60.7%) came from socio-economic disadvantaged backgrounds. BCG immunization coverage was 92.9%; a contagion history was found in 42.9% of cases. Malnutrition was present in 82.1% and the combination HIV / tuberculosis were 17.8%. Pulmonary tuberculosis was the most frequent clinical form (50%). Sputum was positive in 2 children. Nodes location (35.7%) was the main extrapulmonary form. Conclusions: Pulmonary tuberculosis in children is common in sub-saharan Africa.

Lasso ANOVA decompositions for matrix and tensor data,"Abstract Consider the problem of estimating the entries of an unknown mean matrix or tensor given a single noisy realization. In the matrix case, this problem can be addressed by decomposing the mean matrix into a component that is additive in the rows and columns, i.e. the additive ANOVA decomposition of the mean matrix, plus a matrix of elementwise effects, and assuming that the elementwise effects may be sparse. Accordingly, the mean matrix can be estimated by solving a penalized regression problem, applying a lasso penalty to the elementwise effects. Although solving this penalized regression problem is straightforward, specifying appropriate values of the penalty parameters is not. Leveraging the posterior mode interpretation of the penalized regression problem, moment-based empirical Bayes estimators of the penalty parameters can be defined. Estimation of the mean matrix using these moment-based empirical Bayes estimators can be called LANOVA penalization, and the corresponding estimate of the mean matrix can be called the LANOVA estimate. The empirical Bayes estimators are shown to be consistent. Additionally, LANOVA penalization is extended to accommodate sparsity of row and column effects and to estimate an unknown mean tensor. The behavior of the LANOVA estimate is examined under misspecification of the distribution of the elementwise effects, and LANOVA penalization is applied to several datasets, including a matrix of microarray data, a three-way tensor of fMRI data and a three-way tensor of wheat infection data.",2019,Comput.

Classification of EEG signals using the Spatio-temporal feature selection via the elastic net,"Effective classification of motor imagery electroencephalograph (EEG) data is an important challenge. Spatial filtering such as Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) and its variants are commonly used for this task. However, CSP effectiveness depends on the subject-specific frequency band. Even by optimally selecting a subject-specific frequency band, this method still fails for some subjects. On the other hand, some studies suggest that temporal features may discriminate classes more efficiently. This work proposes a hybrid method based on elastic net and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selector Operator (LASSO) to optimally select between spatial and temporal features. This algorithm uses joint spatial and temporal features followed by an optimal combined feature selection scheme for each subject. Results show significant improvement for subjects whose spatial features failed to produce acceptable results and overall improvement over the combined data.",2016,2016 23rd Iranian Conference on Biomedical Engineering and 2016 1st International Iranian Conference on Biomedical Engineering (ICBME)
"Solway Coast Cluster, Cumbria- Evaluation","United Utilities have put forward proposals to improve the wastewater treatment system along the Solway coast in Cumbria, from Bowness-on-Solway (NY 2257 6281) to Drumburgh (NY 2672 5980). Since the proposed works traverse the line of Hadrianâ€™s Wall, which forms part of the trans-national â€˜Frontiers of the Roman Empireâ€™ World Heritage Site, a series of meetings was held between United Utilities and the Hadrianâ€™s Wall Archaeologist, at which an archaeological evaluation strategy was agreed. The strategy, which was designed to limit the impact of the works on this internationally important monument, included the archaeological evaluation of four key points where it was envisaged that the new pipeline would either cross the line of the Wall itself, or would be likely to impact upon archaeological features associated with it. 
The four proposed crossing points, all located within or adjacent to the highway of the Bowness to Drumburgh road, were situated at Fishers Cross (Site D; NGR NY 2399 6227), Kirkland House (Site E; NGR NY 2431 6176), Westfield Marsh (Site G; NGR NY 2475 6126), and Glasson Farm (Site I; NGR NY 2575 6034). Three other sites identified as requiring evaluation were located at Shore Gate House, Bowness Village (Site A; NGR NY 2250 6282), Glasson Wastewater Treatment Works (Site J; NGR NY 2589 6023), and Drumburgh (between manholes 3 and 4) (Site L; NGR NY 2674 5985). In the event, and with the agreement of the Hadrianâ€™s Wall Archaeologist, evaluation of Site L did not proceed due to the presence of a sewer pipe that would have rendered the work ineffective. The archaeological works were carried out intermittently by Oxford Archaeology North (OA North) between February 2006 and April 2007.",2007,
Genetic risk prediction using a spatial autoregressive model with adaptive lasso.,"With rapidly evolving high-throughput technologies, studies are being initiated to accelerate the process toward precision medicine. The collection of the vast amounts of sequencing data provides us with great opportunities to systematically study the role of a deep catalog of sequencing variants in risk prediction. Nevertheless, the massive amount of noise signals and low frequencies of rare variants in sequencing data pose great analytical challenges on risk prediction modeling. Motivated by the development in spatial statistics, we propose a spatial autoregressive model with adaptive lasso (SARAL) for risk prediction modeling using high-dimensional sequencing data. The SARAL is a set-based approach, and thus, it reduces the data dimension and accumulates genetic effects within a single-nucleotide variant (SNV) set. Moreover, it allows different SNV sets having various magnitudes and directions of effect sizes, which reflects the nature of complex diseases. With the adaptive lasso implemented, SARAL can shrink the effects of noise SNV sets to be zero and, thus, further improve prediction accuracy. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that, overall, SARAL is comparable to, if not better than, the genomic best linear unbiased prediction method. The method is further illustrated by an application to the sequencing data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.",2018,Statistics in medicine
Estimation of genomic breeding values using the Horseshoe prior,"BackgroundA method for estimating genomic breeding values (GEBV) based on the Horseshoe prior was introduced and used on the analysis of the 16th QTLMAS workshop dataset, which resembles three milk production traits. The method was compared with five commonly used methods: Bayes A, Bayes B, Bayes C, Bayesian Lasso and GLUP.MethodsThe main difference between the methods is the prior distribution assumed during the estimation of the SNP effects. The distribution of the Bayesian Lasso is a Laplace distribution; for Bayes A is a Student-t; for Bayes B and Bayes C is a spike and slab prior combining a proportion of SNP without effect and a proportion with effect distributed as a Student-t or Gaussian for Bayes B and C, respectively; for GBLUP is similar to a ridge regression. The distribution for the Horseshoe prior behaves like log(1+1/Î²2) (up to a constant). It has an infinite spike at zero and heavy tail that decay by Î²-2 (slower than the Laplace or the Student-t). The implementation of all methods (except GBLUP) was done using a MCMC approach, where the relevant parameters defining the prior distributions were jointly estimated from the data. The GBLUP was done using ASREML.ResultsThe accuracy for all methods ranged from 0.74 to 0.83, representing an improvement of 44% to 78% over the traditional BLUP evaluation. GEBV with the highest accuracy were obtained with Bayes A, Bayes B and the Horseshoe prior. The Horseshoe tended to select smaller number of SNP and assigning them larger effects, while strongly shrinking the remaining SNP to have an effect closer to zero.ConclusionsThe Horseshoe prior showed a different shrinkage pattern than the other methods. While for this specific dataset, this has little impact on the accuracy of the GEBV, it may prove a good property to discriminate true effect from noise, and thereby, improve overall prediction under different scenarios.",2014,BMC Proceedings
Tsunami Inversion of Fault Displacements Based on Sparse Modeling,"A study on tsunami inversion analysis was conducted using Lasso regression, which is a typical approach to sparse modeling. Characteristics of spatiotemporal distribution of the fault slips were then analyzed. Sparse modeling is characterized by yielding obtained solutions that contribute significantly to the output of the model. This feature is useful for investigating the development of prediction models. This paper applies a tsunami inversion analysis based on sparse modeling to the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake Tsunami and analyzes the characteristics of the fault slips.",2019,
Kernel sparse representation with pixel-level and region-level local feature kernels for face recognition,"Face recognition has been popular in the pattern recognition field for decades, but it is still a difficult problem due to the various image distortions. Recently, sparse representation based classification (SRC) was proposed as a novel image classification approach, which is very effective with sufficient training samples for each class. However, the performance drops when the number of training samples is limited. In this paper, we show that effective local image features and appropriate nonlinear kernels are needed in deriving a better classification method based on sparse representation. Thus, we propose a novel kernel SRC framework and utilize effective local image features in this framework for robust face recognition. First, we present a kernel coordinate descent (KCD) algorithm for the LASSO problem in the kernel space, and we successfully integrate it in the SRC framework (called KCD-SRC) for face recognition. Second, we employ local image features and develop both pixel-level and region-level kernels for KCD-SRC based face recognition, making it discriminative and robust against illumination variations and occlusions. Extensive experiments are conducted on three public face databases (Extended YaleB, CMU-PIE and AR) under illumination variations, noise corruptions, continuous occlusions, and registration errors, demonstrating excellent performances of the KCD-SRC algorithm combining with the proposed kernels.",2014,Neurocomputing
Estimating Sparse Neuronal Signal from Hemodynamic Response: the Mixture Components Inference Approach,"The approximate knowledge of the hemodynamic response to neuronal activity is widely used in statistical testing of effects of external stimulation, but has also been applied to estimate the neuronal activity directly from functional magnetic resonance data without knowing the stimulus timing. To this end, sparse linear regression methods have been previously used, including the well-known LASSO and the Dantzig selector. These methods generate a parametric family of solutions with different sparsity, among which a choice is finally based using some information criteria. As an alternative we propose a novel approach that instead utilizes the whole family of sparse regression solutions. Their ensemble provides a first approximation of probability of activation at each timepoint, and together with the conditional neuronal activity distributions estimated with the theory of mixtures with varying concentrations, they serve as the inputs to a Bayes classifier ultimately deciding between the true and false activations. As we show in extensive numerical simulations, the new method performs favourably in comparison with standard approaches in a range of realistic scenarios. This is mainly due to the avoidance of overfitting and underfitting that commonly plague the solutions based on sparse regression combined with model selection methods, including the corrected Akaike Information Criterion. This advantage is finally documented on fMRI task dataset.",2019,bioRxiv

In this paper three such methods, lasso, knockoff and Gaussian covariates are compared using simulations and real data. The Gaussian covariate method is based on exact probabilities which are valid for all $\mathbf{y}$ and $\mathbf{x}_j$ making it model free. Moreover the probabilities agree with those based on the F-distribution for the standard linear model with i.i.d. Gaussian errors. It is conceptually, mathematically and algorithmically very simple, it is very fast and makes no use of simulations. It outperforms lasso and knockoff in all respects by a considerable margin.",2018,arXiv: Methodology
Create a predictive model for neurogenic bladder patients: upper urinary tract damage predictive nomogram.,"Objective: To create a nomogram to evaluate the risk of upper urinary tract damage (UUTD) in patients with neurogenic bladder (NGB) Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 301 patients with NGB who were admitted to certain hospitals. Data collected included clinical symptoms, patients' characteristics, laboratory parameters, imaging findings and urodynamic parameters. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operatorï¼ˆLASSOï¼‰regression model was used to optimize the selection of predictors. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to develop a UUTD risk predictive model. Validation was performed by bootstrap. Results: The predictors included in the nomogram included sex, duration of disease, history of UTI, bladder compliance, and fecal incontinence. The model presented good discrimination with a C-index value of 0.796 (95% confidence interval: 0.74896-0.84304) and good calibration. The C-index value of the interval validation was 0.7872112. The results of decision curve analysis (DCA) demonstrated that the UUTD-risk predictive nomogram was clinically useful. Conclusion: The nomogram incorporating the sex, duration of disease, history of UTI, bladder compliance, and fecal incontinence could be an important tool of UUTD risk prediction in NGB patients.",2019,The International journal of neuroscience

Ensemble Machine Learning and Stock Return Predictability,"Many, even sophisticated, models cannot beat a simple mean combination of univariate stock market return forecasts. We introduce an ensemble machine learning method, which averages forecasts from sophisticated models (like BMA, WALS and LASSO) based on random subsamples and which learns from its mistakes by adaptively changing sampling distributions. Empirically, our novel method improves the simple mean forecast with statistically significant monthly out-of-sample R2 of around 2-3% and annual utility gains around 3%. Our approach benefits from predicting well in volatile periods and especially from extreme market drops. The forecasting gains of our new method stem from improved diversity among individual forecasts. We obtain similar gains in forecasting accuracy when we use our method to predict factor portfolios and other macro economic variables.",2019,
Fusion of iECO image descriptors for buried explosive hazard detection in forward-looking infrared imagery,"Data fusion is a powerful theory that often leads to significant performance gain and/or improved robustness of a given solution. In this article, we explore how fusion can be used to advance our previously established improved Evolutionary COnstructed (iECO) image descriptor framework. The goal of iECO is to learn a diverse set of individuals (variable length chromosome in a genetic algorithm). Each iECO individual encodes a unique composition of different low-level image transformations in the context of a high-level image descriptor. Herein, we investigate multiple kernel (MK) aggregation and MK learning (MKL) for â€œfeature-levelâ€ fusion of iECO chromosomes. Specifically, we explore MKL group lasso (MKLGL) and we put forth a new way to directly assign kernel weights from a measure defined on the kernel matrices. The proposed work is presented in the context of buried explosive hazard detection (EHD) in forward looking (FL) imagery. Experiments are reported using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves on data from a U.S. Army test site that contains multiple target and clutter types, burial depths and times of day. We demonstrate that MK support vector machine (MKSVM) classification outperform single kernel SVM (SKSVM) classification and our weight assignment procedure generalizes well and outperforms MKLGL for EHD in FLIR.",2015,
Connectivity-Informed fMRI Activation Detection,"A growing interest has emerged in studying the correlation structure of spontaneous and task-induced brain activity to elucidate the functional architecture of the brain. In particular, functional networks estimated from resting state (RS) data were shown to exhibit high resemblance to those evoked by stimuli. Motivated by these findings, we propose a novel generative model that integrates RS-connectivity and stimulus-evoked responses under a unified analytical framework. Our model permits exact closed-form solutions for both the posterior activation effect estimates and the model evidence. To learn RS networks, graphical LASSO and the oracle approximating shrinkage technique are deployed. On a cohort of 65 subjects, we demonstrate increased sensitivity in fMRI activation detection using our connectivity-informed model over the standard univariate approach. Our results thus provide further evidence for the presence of an intrinsic relationship between brain activity during rest and task, the exploitation of which enables higher detection power in task-driven studies.",2011,Medical image computing and computer-assisted intervention : MICCAI ...

Multi-objective monitoring of closed-loop controlled systems using adaptive LASSO,"Statistical process control detects nonrandom deviations from a normal distribution. However, most industrial processes are equipped with feedback control loops to reject such disturbances. Hence it is the failure or performance degradation that we should detect instead of mere sensor data patterns that show deviations from normal. In this paper, a multi-objective monitoring approach is proposed to monitor both the system stability and performance. First, closed-loop output data are fitted with an autoregressive moving average model with exogenous inputs (ARMA(X)), using adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). The system stability can be monitored using the largest absolute value of the roots of AR terms. The performance of feedback controller can be monitored based on the Minimum-Variance (MV) principles. The proposed approach was applied to several simulation examples to show that the above two monitoring objects are only sensitive to the faults in processes, but not to disturbances that can be handled by the controller. The ability of the method to localized control loop failure was demonstrated using the Tennesseeâ€“Eastman benchmark problem. In addition, we found that the method was able to identify the failure of the outer loop while the inner loop is still performing in a cascade control.",2015,Journal of The Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers
Leadless pacemaker extraction from a singleâ€center perspective,"BACKGROUND
Leadless pacemaker can be considered as a technical revolution in cardiac pacing devices, with clear advantages over conventional pacemakers in overcoming all lead-related complications. However, the management of these devices once they reach the end of life (EOL) of the battery is still controversial. In the next years, there will be an increase in the need to define a clear strategy in the management of leadless PM once they reach their EOL. Safe extraction of these devices will define in a great manner this strategy METHODS: We performed the extraction of three functioning Nanostim leadless pacemaker prophylactically in two females and one male patients as part of the Nanostim battery depletion field action recommendation. All patients had a prior transesophageal 3D echocardiography to determine the device intracardiac mobility and the extent of possible endothelialization. For the extractions, we used the Nanostim Retrieval Catheter S1RSIN (St. Jude Medical, St. Paul, MN, USA), which is a proprietary catheter provided by the manufacturing company based on a lasso.


RESULTS
Complete extraction of the devices was achieved in all patients using a relatively short fluoroscopic time (16, 19, and 12 minutes).

The extraction of leadless pacemakers can be considered as a safe and feasible procedure using the tools provided by the manufacturer and designed for the extraction. However, a very low threshold must be maintained to avoid any risk to the patients. Our extraction time ranges are between 983 and 1,070 days, nevertheless it is necessary to gather more long-term data to assess the feasibility and safety of these procedures.",2018,Pacing and Clinical Electrophysiology
Contribution Ã  lâ€™analyse de la dynamique des troyens : Ã©volution du rÃ©seau de rÃ©sonances en fonction des frÃ©quences planÃ©taires,"Nous analysons la dynamique des troyens lorsque la geometrie du systeme planetaire evolue. Au premier chapitre, nous developpons un modele seculaire approximant les coordonnees et les frequences propres des points fixes se substituant aux points equilateraux sous lâ€™influence de planetes perturbant le probleme a trois corps restreint. Ce modele met en valeur le fait que les planetes internes ont une influence plus grande que les planetes externes. Au deuxieme chapitre nous etudions lâ€™evolution du systeme planetaire lors de la migration planetaire. Au troisieme chapitre nous classons les resonances agissant sur les troyens en 4 familles, et donnons des methodes permettant de predire leur apparition. Dans les deux chapitres qui suivent nous appliquons notre modele pour etudier lâ€™evolution de la dynamique des troyens de Jupiter et Saturne lors de la migration planetaire. Lors de ce processus, lâ€™evolution des planetes depend de nombreux parametres. Câ€™est pourquoi nous decidons que notre analyse se fera dans le cadre des invariants adiabatiques et en ne faisant varier quâ€™un seul parametre: le demi-grand-axe de Saturne. Nous integrons les populations de troyens de Jupiter et Saturne pour de nombreuses valeurs du parametre. Chaque famille de resonances perturbant les troyens est alors analysee en detail. Notre travail montre que des structures resonantes ont fortement perturbe lâ€™essaim des troyens de Saturne vers la fin de la migration planetaire, ejectant ses troyens sans permettre dâ€™en capturer de nouveaux. Au contraire les troyens de Jupiter sont tres peu perturbes vers la fin de la migration planetaire, ce qui permet lâ€™existence dâ€™une population importante de troyens de Jupiter a la fin de la migration planetaire. Enfin, nous analysons les structures agissant sur les troyens de Neptune dans la configuration actuelle.",2008,
Deep learning of joint myelin and T1w MRI features in normal-appearing brain tissue to distinguish between multiple sclerosis patients and healthy controls,"Myelin imaging is a form of quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that measures myelin content and can potentially allow demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) to be detected earlier. Although focal lesions are the most visible signs of MS pathology on conventional MRI, it has been shown that even tissues that appear normal may exhibit decreased myelin content as revealed by myelin-specific images (i.e., myelin maps). Current methods for analyzing myelin maps typically use global or regional mean myelin measurements to detect abnormalities, but ignore finer spatial patterns that may be characteristic of MS. In this paper, we present a machine learning method to automatically learn, from multimodal MR images, latent spatial features that can potentially improve the detection of MS pathology at early stage. More specifically, 3D image patches are extracted from myelin maps and the corresponding T1-weighted (T1w) MRIs, and are used to learn a latent joint myelin-T1w feature representation via unsupervised deep learning. Using a data set of images from MS patients and healthy controls, a common set of patches are selected via a voxel-wise t-test performed between the two groups. In each MS image, any patches overlapping with focal lesions are excluded, and a feature imputation method is used to fill in the missing values. A feature selection process (LASSO) is then utilized to construct a sparse representation. The resulting normal-appearing features are used to train a random forest classifier. Using the myelin and T1w images of 55 relapse-remitting MS patients and 44 healthy controls in an 11-fold cross-validation experiment, the proposed method achieved an average classification accuracy of 87.9% (SDÂ =Â 8.4%), which is higher and more consistent across folds than those attained by regional mean myelin (73.7%, SDÂ =Â 13.7%) and T1w measurements (66.7%, SDÂ =Â 10.6%), or deep-learned features in either the myelin (83.8%, SDÂ =Â 11.0%) or T1w (70.1%, SDÂ =Â 13.6%) images alone, suggesting that the proposed method has strong potential for identifying image features that are more sensitive and specific to MS pathology in normal-appearing brain tissues.",2018,NeuroImage : Clinical
Augmenting LASSO regression with decision tree for identifying the correlation of genetic polymorphism and adverse events,"A novel algorithm that combines LASSO regression and decision tree is proposed to explore the correlation of adverse events (AE) and genetic polymorphism of CYP2D6*2, *10, *14, CYP1A2*1C, *1F in human subjects in a clinical trial. The genotypes of 30 healthy human subjects in a clinical trial for a natural herbal drug and 53 subjects in the blank group were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing. The AEs occurring during the trial were recorded. The correlations of AE and genetic polymorphism are analyzed by the new combined algorithm. 53 AEs are reported in the end of the study. Five gene subtypes are selected as correlative factors to the specific AEs by the new algorithm: wild type of CYP1A2*1F and abnormal platelet counting, homozygous CYP1A2*1C and abnormal fibrinogen, heterozygous CYP1A2*1C and abnormal blood chlorine, heterozygous CYP1A2*1C and abnormal urobilinogen, wild type of CYP2D6*2 and abnormal APTT (activated partial thromboplastin time). The result indicates the novel algorithm is effective and is able to detect the correlation of AEs and genetic polymorphism in clinical trials.",2013,2013 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine
Biologically inspired survival analysis based on integrating gene expression as mediator with genomic variants,"Accurately linking cancer molecular profiling with survival can lead to improvements in the clinical management of cancer. However, existing survival analysis relies on statistical evidence from a single level of data, without paying much attention to the integration of interacting multi-level data and the underlying biology. Advances in genomic techniques provide unprecedented power of characterizing the cancer tissue in a more complete manner than before, offering the opportunity to design biologically informed and integrative approaches for survival data analysis. Human cancer is characterized by somatic copy number alternation and unique gene expression profiles. However, it remains largely unclear how to integrate the gene expression and genetic variant data to achieve a better prediction of patient survival and an improved understanding of disease progression. Consistent with the biological hierarchy from DNA to RNA, we prioritize each survival-relevant feature with two separate scores, predictive and mechanistic. For mRNA expression levels, predictive features are those mRNAs whose variation in expression levels is associated with survival outcome, and mechanistic features are those mRNAs whose variation in expression levels is associated with genomic variants. Further, we simultaneously integrate information from both the predictive model and the mechanistic model through our new approach, GEMPS (Gene Expression as a Mediator for Predicting Survival). Applied on two cancer types (ovarian and glioblastoma multiforme), our method achieved better prediction power (p-value: 6.18E-03-5.15E-11) than peer methods (GE.CNAs and GE.CNAs. Lasso). Gene set enrichment analysis confirms that the genes utilized for the final survival analysis are biologically important and relevant.",2016,Computers in biology and medicine
Sparse covariance thresholding for high-dimensional variable selection,"In high-dimensions, many variable selection methods, such as the lasso, are often limited by excessive variability and rank deficiency of the sample covariance matrix. Covariance sparsity is a natural phenomenon in high-dimensional applications, such as microarray analysis, image processing, etc., in which a large number of predictors are independent or weakly correlated. In this paper, we propose the covariance-thresholded lasso, a new class of regression methods that can utilize covariance sparsity to improve variable selection. We establish theoretical results, under the random design setting, that relate covariance sparsity to variable selection. Real-data and simulation examples indicate that our method can be useful in improving variable selection performances.",2010,arXiv: Methodology
Why Geometric Progression in Selecting the LASSO Parameter: A Theoretical Explanation,"In situations when we know which inputs are relevant, the least squares method is often the best way to solve linear regression problems. However, in many practical situations, we do not know beforehand which inputs are relevant and which are not. In such situations, a 1-parameter modification of the least squares method known as LASSO leads to more adequate results. To use LASSO, we need to determine the value of the LASSO parameter that best fits the given data. In practice, this parameter is determined by trying all the values from some discrete set. It has been empirically shown that this selection works the best if we try values from a geometric progression. In this paper, we provide a theoretical explanation for this empirical fact. 1 Formulation of the Problem Need for regression. In many real-life situations, we know that the quantity y is uniquely determined by the quantities x1, . . . , xn, but we do not know the exact formula for this dependence. For example, in physics, we know that the aerodynamic resistance increases with the bodyâ€™s velocity, but we often do not know how exactly. In economics, we may know that a change in tax rate influences the economic growth, but we often do not know how exactly. In all such cases, we need to find the dependence y = f(x1, . . . , xn) between several quantities based on the available data, i.e., based on the previous observations (xk1, . . . , xkn, yk) in each of which we know both the values xki of the input quantities xi and the value yk of the output quantity y. In statistics, determining the dependence from the data is known as regression.",2020,

Adaptive penalization in high-dimensional regression and classification with external covariates using variational Bayes.,"Penalization schemes like Lasso or ridge regression are routinely used to regress a response of interest on a high-dimensional set of potential predictors. Despite being decisive, the question of the relative strength of penalization is often glossed over and only implicitly determined by the scale of individual predictors. At the same time, additional information on the predictors is available in many applications but left unused. Here, we propose to make use of such external covariates to adapt the penalization in a data-driven manner. We present a method that differentially penalizes feature groups defined by the covariates and adapts the relative strength of penalization to the information content of each group. Using techniques from the Bayesian tool-set our procedure combines shrinkage with feature selection and provides a scalable optimization scheme. We demonstrate in simulations that the method accurately recovers the true effect sizes and sparsity patterns per feature group. Furthermore, it leads to an improved prediction performance in situations where the groups have strong differences in dynamic range. In applications to data from high-throughput biology, the method enables re-weighting the importance of feature groups from different assays. Overall, using available covariates extends the range of applications of penalized regression, improves model interpretability and can improve prediction performance.",2019,Biostatistics

Efficient Process Monitoring and Fault Isolation with the Integrated use of Markov Random Fields Learning and the Graphical Lasso,"Abstract In this study, a framework for efficiently detecting faults, and isolating fault causes with the integrated use of Markov Random Fields (MRF) and the graphical lasso, is proposed. MRFs are capable of expressing any subtle relationship that appears within a process without any a priori knowledge, and can compute the joint probabilities of the variables, taking in the nonlinearity of chemical processes. The graphical lasso, a regularization algorithm for inducing the sparse precision matrix and learning the structure of a graphical model, mitigates the high computational complexity of learning and inferencing a MRF. Also, by splitting the process variables into inter-relevant groups, it enables quick identification of the fault variable, and fault propagation path detection. The proposed algorithm was applied to the Tennessee Eastman benchmark process (TEP), to test its performance. The 28 fault cases within the TEP model were tested with the new monitoring method, and the results were compared to that of the conventional methods. The proposed method showed high accuracy and efficient fault identification performance, even with the tricky fault cases 4 and 9.",2018,

Analysis of High-Dimensional Regression Models Using Orthogonal Greedy Algorithms,"We begin by reviewing recent results of Ing and Lai (Stat Sin 21:1473â€“1513, 2011) on the statistical properties of the orthogonal greedy algorithm (OGA) in high-dimensional sparse regression models with independent observations. In particular, when the regression coefficients are absolutely summable, the conditional mean squared prediction error and the empirical norm of OGA derived by Ing and Lai (Stat Sin 21:1473â€“1513, 2011) are introduced. We then explore the performance of OGA under more general sparsity conditions. Finally, we obtain the convergence rate of OGA in high-dimensional time series models, and illustrate the advantage of our results compared to those established for Lasso by Basu and Michailidis (Ann Stat 43:1535â€“1567, 2015) and Wu and Wu (Electron J Stat 10:352â€“379, 2016).",2018,
"Une mÃ©thode de lutte gÃ©nÃ©tique contre Anopheles gambiae Giles, 1902","Avec Anopheles funestus (qui doit lui-meme etre un complexe dâ€™especes), les membres des especes du complexe dâ€™A. gambiae constituent les principaux vecteurs du paludisme en Afrique tropicale. On sâ€™accorde generalement a lâ€™heure actuelle sur le fait que les methodes connues et essayees dâ€™eradication du paludisme ne pourront pas sâ€™appliquer dans un proche futur a cette vaste partie du monde ou le type principal de paludisme est le paludisme stable et ou les ressources financieres, le personnel entraine et lâ€™infrastructure sanitaire de base dans les campagnes sont insuffisants. En outre, la resistance a la dieldrin et a lâ€™H.C.H. est deja tres repandue dans deux des especes du complexe d'A. gambiae et on commence aussi a y voir survenir une resistance au D.D.T. Si lâ€™on souhaite donc accomplir quelques progres substantiels pour eradiquer le paludisme de lâ€™Afrique, il ne fait pas de doute que de nouvelles techniques de lutte contre les vecteurs sont necessaires. Lâ€™une dâ€™entre elles peut etre representee par le lÃ¢cher de mÃ¢les steriles.Nous savons a present que le complexe dâ€™A. gambiae est constitue de cinq especes jumelles. Deux dâ€™entre elles sont des formes dâ€™eau saumÃ¢tre : A. melas en Afrique occidentale et A. merus en Afrique orientale. Les trois autres sont des formes dâ€™eau douce qui nâ€™ont pas encore recu de noms definitifs et que lâ€™on nomme especes A, B et C. Lâ€™espece C nâ€™est connue jusqua present que du sud-est de lâ€™Afrique, de Zanzibar et de lâ€™Ethiopie et, autant quâ€™on le sache, ce nâ€™est pas un vecteur du paludisme. Les especes A et B sont courantes dans toute lâ€™Afrique tropicale et constituent, dans le complexe, les principaux vecteurs du paludisme. Si lâ€™on croise entre elles nâ€™importe lesquelles de ces cinq especes, on obtient une generation F1 viable dans laquelle les mÃ¢les se montrent steriles (a des degres differents suivant les especes parentales en cause dans le croisement) tandis que les femelles ont une fertilite presque normale. Certains de ces croisements, en particulier ceux mettant en cause les mÃ¢les des especes A et B et les femelles d'A. melas et d'A. merus , produisent une generation F1 ou le taux des sexes est tres perturbe puisquâ€™elle est presque exclusivement composee de mÃ¢les steriles.Ces hybrides mÃ¢les steriles ont ete utilises dans de nombreuses experiences de laboratoire. Les premieres consistaient a ajouter des adultes mÃ¢les steriles en proportions variees dans de petites cages contenant des mÃ¢les et des femelles normaux. Dâ€™autres sâ€™adressaient a des larves du premier stade provenant de croisements connus pour produire principalement des mÃ¢les steriles et un tres petit nombre de femelles ou meme pas du tout, que lâ€™on ajoutait en proportions variees dans des recipients contenant des larves du premier stade dâ€™une seule espece. Les larves etaient elevees ensemble jusquâ€™au stade adulte et les adultes etaient conserves ensemble dans des cages. On les maintenait ainsi pendant quelques jours, dans les deux categories dâ€™experiences, les femelles etaient nourries de sang et isolees par la suite chacune dans un tube contenant de lâ€™eau. On conservait les pontes pour voir si elles allaient eclore.Les resultats montraient de facon concluante que les mÃ¢les hybrides steriles etaient tres competitifs avec les mÃ¢les normaux et que meme lorsquâ€™ils etaient en proportions peu elevees (meme en des proportions moindres que la moitie), ils reduisaient de facon significative le nombre des pontes viables obtenues par des femelles avec lesquelles ils avaient ete eleves.Mais il restait a savoir si de tels mÃ¢les steriles introduits dans des populations naturelles seraient egalement competitifs et a etudier cette possibilite par une petite experience de terrain qui fut effectuee en Haute-Volta a la fin de 1968. La, deux colonies de laboratoire etablies depuis longtemps, lâ€™une de lâ€™espece B et lâ€™autre de lâ€™espece A. melas , furent croisees en masse en choisissant les mÃ¢les de la. premiere espece et les femelles de la derniere. Ce croisement produisit une generation F1 presque entierement composee de mÃ¢les steriles. On ne poussait en fait lâ€™elevage de la generation F1 que jusquâ€™au stade nymphal et les nymphes etaient deposees dans des collections dâ€™eau naturelles et artificielles, dans de petits villages isoles et autour de ceux-ci pres de Bobo-Dioulasso, qui contenaient une population pure de lâ€™espece A. On commenca les lÃ¢chers au debut de la saison seche dans une population en voie de declin. Quelque 300.000 nymphes furent lÃ¢chees pendant une periode de deux mois, mais il est douteux que les nombres aient ete adequats au cours du premier mois. Durant la majeure partie de cette periode de deux mois, 75 % des mÃ¢les captures dans les cases et dans les lieux de repos exterieurs furent identifies par dissection comme etant des hybrides mÃ¢les steriles relÃ¢ches. La majorite des femelles capturees dans les cases du village apres les lÃ¢chers de nymphes continuerent cependant a deposer des Å“ufs fertiles, la proportion dâ€™Å“ufs demeurant steriles nâ€™etant que tres legerement superieure a celle du village temoin.Un certain nombre de facteurs doivent avoir contribue a ce manque significatif dâ€™accouplements entre les mÃ¢les steriles introduits et les femelles naturelles. Il peut sâ€™agir dâ€™une modification hostile du climat au moment du maximum des lÃ¢chers de nymphes, des conditions relativement artificielles dans lesquelles les mÃ¢les steriles furent eleves jusquâ€™au stade nymphal et peut-etre aussi dâ€™une periode trop courte des lÃ¢chers. On pense cependant generalement que le comportement dâ€™accouplement des mÃ¢les steriles, bien que ceux-ci soient tres competitifs dans les conditions confinees dâ€™une petite cage de laboratoire ou nâ€™existent que des populations specifiques conditionnees a la vie dans de telles cages, nâ€™est pas le meme dans les conditions naturelles en raison du comportement naturel dâ€™accouplement des populations sauvages. De plus, lâ€™utilisation dâ€™un croisement entre deux especes pour lutter contre une troisieme peut etre responsable de l'apparition dâ€™une nouvelle barriere empechant lâ€™accouplement entre deux mÃ¢les steriles et femelles naturelles.",1971,Annales de parasitologie humaine et compareÌe
Unary Pushdown Automata and Straight-Line Programs,"We consider decision problems for deterministic pushdown automata over the unary alphabet (udpda, for short). Udpda are a simple computation model that accept exactly the unary regular languages, but can be exponentially more succinct than finite-state automata. We complete the complexity landscape for udpda by showing that emptiness (and thus universality) is P-hard, equivalence and compressed membership problems are P-complete, and inclusion is coNP-complete. Our upper bounds are based on a translation theorem between udpda and straight-line programs over the binary alphabet (SLPs). We show that the characteristic sequence of any udpda can be represented as a pair of SLPsâ€”one for the prefix, one for the lassoâ€”that have size linear in the size of the udpda and can be computed in polynomial time. Hence, decision problems on udpda are reduced to decision problems on SLPs. Conversely, any SLP can be converted in logarithmic space into a udpda, and this forms the basis for our lower bound proofs. We show coNP-hardness of the ordered matching problem for SLPs, from which we derive coNP-hardness for inclusion. In addition, we complete the complexity landscape for unary nondeterministic pushdown automata by showing that the universality problem is Î 2 P-hard, using a new class of integer expressions. Our techniques have applications beyond udpda. We show that our results imply Î 2 P-completeness for a natural fragment of Presburger arithmetic and coNP lower bounds for compressed matching problems with one-character wildcards.",2014,

Eigen-Epistasis for detecting gene-gene interactions,"BackgroundA large amount of research has been devoted to the detection and investigation of epistatic interactions in genome-wide association studies (GWASs). Most of the literature focuses on low-order interactions between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with significant main effects.ResultsIn this paper we propose an original approach for detecting epistasis at the gene level, without systematically filtering on significant genes. We first compute interaction variables for each gene pair by finding its Eigen-Epistasis component, defined as the linear combination of Gene SNPs having the highest correlation with the phenotype. The selection of significant effects is done using a penalized regression method based on Group Lasso controlling the False Discovery Rate.ConclusionThe method is tested against two recent alternative proposals from the literature using synthetic data, and shows good performances in different settings. We demonstrate the power of our approach by detecting new gene-gene interactions on three genome-wide association studies.",2017,BMC Bioinformatics
Robust variable selection for the varying coefficient model based on composite L 1â€“L 2 regression,"The varying coefficient model (VCM) is an important generalization of the linear regression model and many existing estimation procedures for VCM were built on L 2 loss, which is popular for its mathematical beauty but is not robust to non-normal errors and outliers. In this paper, we address the problem of both robustness and efficiency of estimation and variable selection procedure based on the convex combined loss of L 1 and L 2 instead of only quadratic loss for VCM. By using local linear modeling method, the asymptotic normality of estimation is driven and a useful selection method is proposed for the weight of composite L 1 and L 2. Then the variable selection procedure is given by combining local kernel smoothing with adaptive group LASSO. With appropriate selection of tuning parameters by Bayesian information criterion (BIC) the theoretical properties of the new procedure, including consistency in variable selection and the oracle property in estimation, are established. The finite sample performance of the new method is investigated through simulation studies and the analysis of body fat data. Numerical studies show that the new method is better than or at least as well as the least square-based method in terms of both robustness and efficiency for variable selection.",2013,Journal of Applied Statistics
Possibilistic testing of OWL axioms against RDF data,"Abstract We develop the theory of a possibilistic framework for OWL 2 axiom testing against RDF datasets, as an alternative to statistics-based heuristics. The intuition behind it is to evaluate the credibility of OWL 2 axioms based on the evidence available in the form of a set of facts contained in a chosen RDF dataset. To achieve it, we first define the notions of development, content, support, confirmation and counterexample of an axiom.

ç§»æ¤é£Ÿé“çš„ stents çš„å†…è§†é•œçš„ç®¡ç†å’Œé¢„é˜²,"The use of self-expandable metallic stents has increased recently to palliate inoperable esophageal neoplasia and also in the management of benign strictures. Migration is one of the most common complications after stent placement and the endoscopist should be able to recognize and manage this situation. Several techniques for managing migrated stents have been described, as well as new techniques for preventing stent migration. Most stents have a 'lasso' at the upper flange which facilitates stent repositioning or removal. An overtube, endoloop and large polypectomy snare may be useful for the retrieval of stents migrated into the stomach. External fixation of the stent with Shimâ€™s technique is efficient in preventing stent migration. Suturing the stent to the esophageal wall, new stent designs with larger flanges and double-layered stents are promising techniques to prevent stent migration but they warrant validation in a larger cohort of patients.",2014,
On Meillassouxâ€™s â€œTransparent Cageâ€: Speculative Realism and its Discontents,"In After Finitude (2006), French philosopher Quentin Meillassoux levels a severe critique of post-Kantian philosophies. From Marxism and phenomenology to psychoanalysis and deconstruction, continental thought has suffered the limitations of what Meillassoux calls â€œcorrelationism.â€ Correlationismâ€”realismâ€™s named antagonistâ€”maintains that â€œwe only ever have access to the correlation between thinking and being, and never to either term considered apart from the otherâ€ (2008a, 5).1 Since we do not have a rational access to things-in-themselves, all we have after Kant, all we are allowed to discuss philosophically, are the transcendental conditions for knowledge.2 The limits of my epistemology are the limits of my concepts and categories. Any claims of knowledge must therefore be qualifi ed by â€œfor us,â€ that is, for us fi nite beings. As a result, Meillassoux argues, we have foreclosed any genuine access to the external world, that is, to an absolute reality, to what he calls â€œthe great outdoors...that outside which was not relative to us... existing in itself regardless of whether we are thinking of it or notâ€ (2008a, 7). In other words, we have confi ned ourselves to a â€œâ€˜transparent cage,â€™â€",2015,symploke
Coupling Bacterioplankton Populations and Environment to Community Function in Coastal Temperate Waters,"Bacterioplankton play a key role in marine waters facilitating processes important for carbon cycling. However, the influence of specific bacterial populations and environmental conditions on bacterioplankton community performance remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to identify drivers of bacterioplankton community functions, taking into account the variability in community composition and environmental conditions over seasons, in two contrasting coastal systems. A Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) analysis of the biological and chemical data obtained from surface waters over a full year indicated that specific bacterial populations were linked to measured functions. Namely, Synechococcus (Cyanobacteria) was strongly correlated with protease activity. Both function and community composition showed seasonal variation. However, the pattern of substrate utilization capacity could not be directly linked to the community dynamics. The overall importance of dissolved organic matter (DOM) parameters in the LASSO models indicate that bacterioplankton respond to the present substrate landscape, with a particular importance of nitrogenous DOM. The identification of common drivers of bacterioplankton community functions in two different systems indicates that the drivers may be of broader relevance in coastal temperate waters.",2016,Frontiers in Microbiology

Sparse Convex Clustering,"ABSTRACTConvex clustering, a convex relaxation of k-means clustering and hierarchical clustering, has drawn recent attentions since it nicely addresses the instability issue of traditional nonconvex clustering methods. Although its computational and statistical properties have been recently studied, the performance of convex clustering has not yet been investigated in the high-dimensional clustering scenario, where the data contains a large number of features and many of them carry no information about the clustering structure. In this article, we demonstrate that the performance of convex clustering could be distorted when the uninformative features are included in the clustering. To overcome it, we introduce a new clustering method, referred to as Sparse Convex Clustering, to simultaneously cluster observations and conduct feature selection. The key idea is to formulate convex clustering in a form of regularization, with an adaptive group-lasso penalty term on cluster centers. To optimally balance the t...",2016,ArXiv
Head and Body positions as risk-factors for sleep obstructive breathing,"Objective: We explored the causal relationship between Head-Body positions (HBp) and Sleep obstructive apnea/hypopnea (OAH) to fill the evidence gap in this topic. Methods: Rotations (pitch/yaw) and directions (prone, supine, up/left, supine, right) of HBp were captured by two miniaturized sensors under 45Â° segments during type1 PSG in 20 consecutive OSA patients. Sequential categorical data of Arousals (A, n=559) and OAH events (n=630) (accordingly to AASM2012) associated with HBp status (n=1633) were built. A timestamps-based algorithm was applied to extract every possible combinations between changes in HBp and events. The association between HBp and events risk was evaluated with Lasso-logistic and RandomForest models Results: Head and body prone pitching (PP) and right yawing (RY) were found significantly associated to either A or OAH events. Head position played the most important role (OR=2.2 for PP and 3.9 for RY), compared to that of body postural changes (OR=1.2 for RY and OR=1.1 for PP). Chronological order analysis showed that HBp changes occurred after A (73.7%) or OAH (72.6%) episodes. A and OAH events were triggered by HBp in only 23% observations. Rarely, A and OAH events occurred during a long and stable HBp (2.5%). Conclusion: Prone pitching and right yawing were the most important positions contributing to the classification of A and OAH events. HBp seemed here more likely consequences than causes of A or OAH risk.",2019,ERJ Open Research
The Phytoplankton Nannochloropsis oculata Enhances the Ability of Roseobacter Clade Bacteria to Inhibit the Growth of Fish Pathogen Vibrio anguillarum,"BACKGROUND
Phytoplankton cultures are widely used in aquaculture for a variety of applications, especially as feed for fish larvae. Phytoplankton cultures are usually grown in outdoor tanks using natural seawater and contain probiotic or potentially pathogenic bacteria. Some Roseobacter clade isolates suppress growth of the fish pathogen Vibrio anguillarum. However, most published information concerns interactions between probiotic and pathogenic bacteria, and little information is available regarding the importance of phytoplankton in these interactions. The objectives of this study, therefore, were to identify probiotic Roseobacter clade members in phytoplankton cultures used for rearing fish larvae and to investigate their inhibitory activity towards bacterial fish pathogens in the presence of the phytoplankton Nannochloropsis oculata.


METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS
The fish pathogen V. anguillarum, was challenged with 6 Roseobacter clade isolates (Sulfitobacter sp. (2 strains), Thalassobius sp., Stappia sp., Rhodobacter sp., and Antarctobacter sp.) from phytoplankton cultures under 3 different nutritional conditions. In an organic nutrient-rich medium (VNSS), 6 Roseobacter clade isolates, as well as V. anguillarum, grew well (10(9) CFU/ml), even when cocultured. In contrast, in a phytoplankton culture medium (ESM) based on artificial seawater, coculture with the 6 isolates decreased the viability of V. anguillarum by approximately more than 10-fold. Excreted substances in media conditioned by growth of the phytoplankton N. oculata (NCF medium) resulted in the complete eradication of V. anguillarum when cocultured with the roseobacters. Autoclaved NCF had the same inhibitory effect. Furthermore, Sulfitobacter sp. much more efficiently incorporated (14)C- photosynthetic metabolites ((14)C-EPM) excreted by N. oculata than did V. anguillarum.


CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE
Cocultures of a phytoplankton species and Roseobacter clade members exhibited a greater antibacterial effect against an important fish pathogen (V. anguillarum) than roseobacters alone. Thus, cooperation of N. oculata, and perhaps other phytoplankton species, with certain roseobacters might provide a powerful tool for eliminating fish pathogens from fish-rearing tanks.",2011,PLoS ONE
Analysis on Train Stopping Accuracy based on Regression Algorithms,"Stopping accuracy is one of the most important indexes of efficiency of automatic train operation (ATO) systems. Traditional stopping control algorithms in ATO systems have some drawbacks, as many factors have not been taken into account. In the large amount of field-collected data about stopping accuracy there are many factors (e.g. system delays, stopping time, net pressure) which affecting stopping accuracy. In this paper, three popular data mining methods are proposed to analyze the train stopping accuracy. Firstly, we find fifteen factors which have impact on the stopping accuracy. Then, ridge regression, lasso regression and elastic net regression are employed to mine models to reflecting the relationship between the fifteen factors and the stopping accuracy. Then, the three models are compared by using Akaike information criterion (AIC), a model selection criterion which considering the trade-off between accuracy and complexity.Â The computational results show that elastic net regression model has a best performance on AIC value. Finally, we obtain the parameters which can make the train stop more accurately which can provide a reference to improve stopping accuracy for ATO systems.",2014,JSW
Activity of intracellular antibiotics,"SummaryWe have studied the intracellular bioactivity of several antimicrobial agents against two strains ofStaphylococcus aureus, a pathogen sequestrated in phagolysosomes, using peripheral blood neutrophils from human volunteers. This was compared to the activity of cell-associated drugs also measuredin vitro. Several discrepancies (high cellular association, low bioactivity) were observed (coumermycin, glycopeptides, erythromycin and clindamycin) which can be due to the binding of the drug to a particular cellular organelle, to intracellular metabolization or inactivation, to unfavourable conditions in the phagolysosome (pH drop), or to a toxic effect of the drug on the functions of the neutrophil. Addition of the antibiotic during ingestion was frequently associated with better neutrophil-dependent killing through several potential mechanisms: coingestion of the antibiotic with the inoculum, modification of opsonization, release of activating substances and fragilization of the microorganism to oxygen-dependent or -independent killing mechanisms.ZusammenfassungAn neutrophilen Granulozyten des peripheren Blutes von freiwilligen Probanden wurde die intrazellulÃ¤re AktivitÃ¤t verschiedener Antibiotika gegen zwei StÃ¤mme vonStaphylococcus aureus, einem in die Phagolysosomen sequestrierten Erreger, untersucht. Dies wurde mit der AktivitÃ¤t der zellassoziierten Substanz verglichen, die auchin vitro gemessen wurde. Es fanden sich Unterschiede wie hohe zellulÃ¤re Assoziation und geringe BioaktivitÃ¤t bei Coumermycin, Glykopeptiden, Erythromycin und Clindamycin, die auf die Bindung der Substanz an bestimmte Zellorganellen, auf intrazellulÃ¤rer Metabolisierung oder Inaktivierung, ungÃ¼nstigen Bedingungen im Phagolysosom (Absinken des pH) oder toxischen Wirkungen der Substanz auf Granulozytenfunktionen beruhen kÃ¶nnte.

Penerapan Group Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator sebagai Metode Alternatif dalam Menangani Data Berdimensi Tinggi.,"HAIFA MARDHOTILLAH. The Application of Group Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator as an Alternative Method for Handling High Dimensional Data. Supervised by BAGUS SARTONO and YENNI ANGRAINI. Coefficients regression can be estimated by using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Method. However, LSM can not be applied to high-dimensional data (HDD). HDD is the data that the number of explanatory variables is more than the number of observations. This can be happened due to the singularity of matrix X'X so it does not have inverse. One of the method to handle that problem is Group of Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Group LASSO). Group LASSO is selecting groups of explanatory variables by shrinking the value of the coefficient to zero or close to zero to get a simple model. The data used in this study is the content of Curcuma in a simplicia measured using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR). Grouping was done by information about the nature of chemical properties and sequence of wave numbers. Grouping which provides the simplest models with high accuracy values were grouping that based on FTIR spectrum plot which was divided into 23 groups. This group gave 166 explanatory variables. The accuracy of the model value by 0.98.",2015,
Fish stable isotope community structure of a Bahamian coral reef,"Stable isotopes have provided important insight into the trophic structure and interaction in many ecosystems, but to date have scarcely been applied to the complex food webs of coral reefs. We sampled white muscle tissues from the fish species composing 80% of the biomass in the 4â€“512Â g body mass range at Cape Eleuthera (the Bahamas) in order to examine isotopic niches characterised by Î´13C and Î´15N data and explore whether fish body size is a driver of trophic position based on Î´15N. We found the planktivore isotopic niche was distinct from those of the other trophic guilds suggesting the unique isotopic baseline of pelagic production sources. Other trophic guilds showed some level of overlap among them especially in the Î´13C value which is attributable to source omnivory. Surprising features of the isotopic niches included the benthivore Halichoeres pictus, herbivores Acanthurus coeruleus and Coryphopterus personatus and omnivore Thalassoma bifasciatum being close to the planktivore guild, while the piscivore Aulostomus maculatus came within the omnivore and herbivore ellipses. These characterisations contradicted the simple trophic categories normally assigned to these species. Î´15N tended to increase with body mass in most species, and at community level, the linear Î´15Nâ€“log2 body mass relationship pointing to a mean predatorâ€“prey mass ratio of 1047:1 and a relatively long food chain compared with studies in other aquatic systems. This first demonstration of a positive Î´15Nâ€“body mass relationship in a coral reef fish community suggested that the Cape Eleuthera coral reef food web was likely supported by one main pathway and bigger reef fishes tended to feed at higher trophic position. Such finding is similar to other marine ecosystems (e.g. North Sea).",2019,Marine Biology

Insecticidal efficacy of natural diatomaceous earth deposits from Greece and Romania against four stored grain beetles: the effect of temperature and relative humidity.,"In two separate experimental bioassays, the efficacy of diatomaceous earth (DE) deposits from Greece and Romania, as well as two DE commercial formulations were evaluated against four stored-product beetle species. In the 1 experiment, four doses (100, 300, 500 and 900 ppm) of two Greek (Elassona 1 and Elassona 2), two Romanian (PatRom and AdRom) DEs and two commercial DEs (SilicoSec and PyriSec) were tested against adults of Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) (Coleoptera Tenebrionidae) and Oryzaephilus surinamensis (L.) (Coleoptera Silvanidae) in wheat and barley. In the 2 experiment, the effect of temperature (20, 25 and 30 Â°C) and relative humidity (RH) (55 and 75%) on the efficacy of DEs from Greece (Elassona 1), Romania (PatRom) and the commercial DE SilicoSec at three doses (300, 600 and 900 ppm) in wheat was investigated against adults of Sitophilus oryzae (L.) (Coleoptera Curculionidae) and Rhyzopertha dominica (F.) (Coleoptera Bostrychidae). Mortality of the exposed adults in both experiments was assessed after 7, 14 and 21 days of exposure. In the 1 experiment, the most effective DE was PyriSec which caused complete mortality of O. surinamensis adults at 300 ppm after 7 and 14 days of exposure in wheat and barley respectively. In both commodities, the Greek (Elassona 1) and Romanian (PatRom) DEs had the same performance with SilicoSec at 500 ppm. Complete mortality of T. castaneum adults was recorded after 21 days at the highest dose in both commodities treated with PyriSec. Greek and Romanian DEs caused low mortality (< 25%) even after 21 days of exposure at the highest dose. T. castaneum was less susceptible than O. surinamensis, especially to Greek and Romanian DEs. Results from the 2 experiment indicated that S. oryzae adults were more susceptible than R. dominica adults to the tested DEs. Mortality levels for both species were high, but only at 900 ppm. The increase of temperature, increased the efficacy of the tested DEs against adults of both species. Higher mortality levels were recorded in the low RH for both species. The Romanian DE PatRom was more effective compared with SilicoSec and the Greek DE Elassona 1 against S. oryzae and R. dominica adults at 900 ppm and 25 Â°C.",2016,Bulletin of Insectology
Trace chemical analysis of high-purity glass,"SummaryTrace-element impurities in high-purity silica (Corning Code 7940 fused silica and J. T. Baker Ultrex silicon dioxide), 96% silica glass (Corning Code 7913), borosilicate glasses (Corning Code 7740 and Owens-Illinois KG-33) and doped optical waveguide glass have been determined by spark-source mass-spectrometry, optical-emission spectrography, neutron-activation analysis, atomic-absorption and plasma emission spectrometry, spectrophotometry, voltammetry and chemical methods. Particular care was taken to prepare samples and carry out analyses in a clean environment with ultrapure reagents. In most cases some 30 elements as well as water were determined by two or more of the techniques indicated. The impurity level for many elements in the high-purity silica and optical waveguide glass is in the ng/g range and in theÎ¼g/g range for the other glasses. Spark-source mass-spectrometry and neutron-activation analyses were carried out not only on samples prepared by a hydrofluoric acid dissolution-evaporation procedure but also on undissolved samples for volatile elements such as B, P, S, As and Hg.

Triangular Simultaneous Equations Models in High-Dimensional Settings with Possibly Many Endogenous Regressors,"This paper explores the validity of the two-stage estimation procedures for triangular simultaneous linear equations models when the number(s) of the rst and/or second-stage regressors grow with and exceed the sample size n. In particular, the number of endogenous regressors in the main equation can also grow with and exceed n. The analysis concerns the sparsity case, i.e., k1(= k1n), the maximum number of non-zero components in the vectors of parameters in the rst-stage equations, and k2(= k2n), the number of non-zero components in the vector of parameters in the second-stage equation, are allowed to grow with n but small compared to n. I consider the high-dimensional version of the two-stage least square estimator where one obtains the tted regressors from the rst-stage regression by a least square estimator with l1regularization (Lasso or Dantzig selector) when the rst-stage regression concerns a large number of regressors relative to n, and then apply a Lasso technique with these tted regressors in the second-stage regression. I establish su cient conditions for estimation consistency in l2âˆ’norm and variable-selection consistency (i.e., the two-stage high-dimensional estimators correctly select the non-zero coe cients in the main equation with high probability). Depending on the underlying su cient conditions that are imposed, the rates of convergence in terms of the l2âˆ’error and the smallest sample size required to obtain these consistency results di er by factors involving k1 and/or k2. Simulations are conducted to gain insight on the nite sample performance of the two-stage high-dimensional estimator. âˆ—Haas School of Business, UC Berkeley, CA, 94720",2013,

Inversion of Chromophoric Dissolved Organic Matter Using Sparse Regression,"Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) retrieval remains to be a challenging task in water color remote sensing research due to its highly spatial and temporal variability. In this paper, we present a novel CDOM retrieval algorithm that takes advantage of the sparse learning, which can simultaneously perform feature selection and parameter estimation. More specifically, by incorporating the band interaction terms into the original spectral matrix and let it be the basis matrix, then the inversion task can be converted to a classical sparse regression problem, namely LASSO, which can be efficiently solved by the coordinate descend algorithm. Experimental results conducted on both simulated and in-situ datasets have demonstrated the efficiency and superiority of the proposed method over some conventional empirical algorithms.",2019,IGARSS 2019 - 2019 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium

Herbicides such as Dual (metolachlor), Lasso (alachlor), Eptam (EPTC), atrazine, Bladex (cyanazine) and RoÂ·Neet (cycloate) require higher rates to be effective in high organic matter soils. On the other hand, crop safety may be marginal on low organic matter soils.",1984,NDSu Extension Circular

Background Subtraction via generalized fused lasso foreground modeling,"Background Subtraction (BS) is one of the key steps in video analysis. Many background models have been proposed and achieved promising performance on public data sets. However, due to challenges such as illumination change, dynamic background etc. the resulted foreground segmentation often consists of holes as well as background noise. In this regard, we consider generalized fused lasso regularization to quest for intact structured foregrounds. Together with certain assumptions about the background, such as the low-rank assumption or the sparse-composition assumption (depending on whether pure background frames are provided), we formulate BS as a matrix decomposition problem using regularization terms for both the foreground and background matrices. Moreover, under the proposed formulation, the two generally distinctive background assumptions can be solved in a unified manner. The optimization was carried out via applying the augmented Lagrange multiplier (ALM) method in such a way that a fast parametric-flow algorithm is used for updating the foreground matrix. Experimental results on several popular BS data sets demonstrate the advantage of the proposed model compared to state-of-the-arts.",2015,2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)
A Novel Gene Signature-Based Model Predicts Biochemical Recurrence-Free Survival in Prostate Cancer Patients after Radical Prostatectomy,"Abstract: Currently, decision-making regarding biochemical recurrence (BCR) following prostatectomy relies solely on clinical parameters. We therefore attempted to develop an integrated prediction model based on a molecular signature and clinicopathological features, in order to forecast the risk for BCR and guide clinical decision-making for postoperative therapy. Using high-throughput screening and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) in the training set, a novel gene signature for biochemical recurrence-free survival (BCRFS) was established. Validation of the prognostic value was performed in five other independent datasets, including our patient cohort. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to evaluate the importance of risk for BCR. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (tROC) was used to evaluate the predictive power. In combination with relevant clinicopathological features, a decision tree was built to improve the risk stratification. The gene signature exhibited a strong capacity for identifying high-risk BCR patients, and multivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated that the gene signature consistently acted as a risk factor for BCR. The decision tree was successfully able to identify the high-risk subgroup. Overall, the gene signature established in the present study is a powerful predictor and risk factor for BCR after radical prostatectomy.",2019,Cancers

COL INF-04 VIH en Afrique subsaharienne : centraliser tous les efforts sur la premiÃ¨re ligne de traitement,"Contexte Le VIH en Afrique subsaharienne est caracterisee par une prevalence elevee, un acces aux antiretroviraux (ARV) encore limite, un grand nombre de perdus de vue (PdV) et une mortalite precoce importante a lâ€™initiation du traitement. Par ailleurs, les ARV sont encore trop souvent a la charge des patients. Methode Le CHU de Bobo Dioulasso (Burkina Faso) Å“uvre depuis plusieurs annees dans la prise en charge des patients VIH+ en partenariat avec ESTHER. Pour tenter de remedier aux difficultes sus-citees, nous avons mis en place certaines actions de sante que nous nous proposons de decrire et dâ€™evaluer. Resultats Depuis 2005, il a ete mis en place un protocole dâ€™observance systematique, une evaluation informatique systematique de lâ€™observance des patients sous traitement, un protocole de recherche active des PdV avec un systeme dâ€™alerte et enfin, un renforcement des exonerations des ARV.

Parallel coordinate descent methods for big data optimization,"In this work we show that randomized (block) coordinate descent methods can be accelerated by parallelization when applied to the problem of minimizing the sum of a partially separable smooth convex function and a simple separable convex function. The theoretical speedup, as compared to the serial method, and referring to the number of iterations needed to approximately solve the problem with high probability, is a simple expression depending on the number of parallel processors and a natural and easily computable measure of separability of the smooth component of the objective function. In the worst case, when no degree of separability is present, there may be no speedup; in the best case, when the problem is separable, the speedup is equal to the number of processors. Our analysis also works in the mode when the number of blocks being updated at each iteration is random, which allows for modeling situations with busy or unreliable processors. We show that our algorithm is able to solve a LASSO problem involving a matrix with 20 billion nonzeros in 2 h on a large memory node with 24 cores.",2016,Mathematical Programming
Thermochemistry of gas-phase and surface species via LASSO-assisted subgraph selection,"Graph theory-based regression techniques, such as group additivity, have widely been implemented for fast estimation of thermochemistry of large molecules. The essence of these techniques lies in graphs that molecules are decomposed to. These graphs are selected based on heuristics and as a result, they may not give optimal accuracy and are hard to choose for non-nearest-neighbor electronic effects such as ring strain, steric hindrance, and resonance structures. Here, we explore LASSO, a feature selection algorithm, to select the optimal set of graph descriptors for predicting the standard enthalpy of formation, Î”fHÂ°. We gather hydrocarbon gas-phase data from the NIST Webbook and the Burcat's databases. We find that models using LASSO-based graph descriptors from the exhaustively enumerated graph descriptor space predict Î”fHÂ° more accurately than the traditional group additivity. We compare our framework with state-of-the-art machine-learning models for the QM9 data set. The mean absolute error of 1.39 kcal molâˆ’1 is comparable to published machine learning models. To cope with the computational cost of complete enumeration, we present: (1) a semi-supervised LASSO learning method and (2) an adsorbate subgraph mining algorithm. The former prunes the graph descriptor space on-the-fly during the LASSO regression and is applied to a gas-phase hydrocarbon data set. The latter enumerates a truncated graph descriptor space from adsorbate graphs of surface science data. For lignin monomer adsorbates on Pt(111), considered here as an illustrative example, descriptors selected from the adsorbate subgraph space result in a mean absolute error and a root mean square error of 2.08 and 3.03 kcal molâˆ’1, respectively. We discuss a simple method that identifies outliers in descriptor space that result in large model errors so the accuracy can be improved with the addition of suitable data.",2018,Reaction Chemistry and Engineering
Contenuti e metodi dell'insegnamento della matematica tra il 1970 e il 1990,"Il lavoro di diploma presentato in questa sede si e posto come obiettivo quello di ricercare i contenuti e i metodi dellâ€™insegnamento della matematica tra il 1970 e il 1990. Si e scelto questo lasso di tempo perche esso e caratterizzato da numerosi cambiamenti in ambito scolastico. Il piu importante fra tutti e stato quello relativo alla nascita della scuola media unica ticinese nel 1974. Si sono confrontati i tre programmi delle scuole medie di quegli anni, concentrandosi sulla disciplina della matematica, mettendo in evidenza i contenuti insegnati e la metodologia usata dai docenti. Inoltre dalla ricerca, specialmente confrontando i suddetti programmi con quelli di altri ordini scolastici e altri decenni, sono scaturite anche altre caratteristiche legate allâ€™insegnamento della disciplina presa in esame. Ovvero il numero di ore assegnate a questâ€™ultima, come si chiamava nel passato (non si e sempre chiamata matematica), il prestigio che essa vanta nella societa, chi la insegnava, da quando si ha la separazione per livelli e le finalita dellâ€™insegnamento. 
Il dato piu sorprendente che e scaturito da questo lavoro e quello relativo ai programmi per le prime scuole medie del 1976. Infatti in essi gli esperti introdussero degli argomenti come i gruppi, i corpi e gli anelli, i quali sono insegnati allâ€™universita. La giustificazione di questo fenomeno e da ricondurre al fatto che gli esperti in quegli anni hanno voluto sperimentare un modello denominato matematica moderna. Relatore: Wolfgang Sahlfeld.

"Recursive $\ell_{1,\infty}$ Group Lasso","We introduce a recursive adaptive group lasso algorithm for real-time penalized least squares prediction that produces a time sequence of optimal sparse predictor coefficient vectors. At each time index the proposed algorithm computes an exact update of the optimal l1,âˆž-penalized recursive least squares (RLS) predictor. Each update minimizes a convex but nondifferentiable function optimization problem. We develop an on-line homotopy method to reduce the computational complexity. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the l1 regularized RLS algorithm for a group sparse system identification problem and has lower implementation complexity than direct group lasso solvers.",2012,IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing
Tensor Graphical Model: Non-convex Optimization and Statistical Inference.,"We consider estimation and inference of precision matrices in sparse tensor graphical models. To facilitate study, data is assumed to follow a tensor normal distribution whose covariance has a Kronecker product structure. A critical challenge in both estimation and inference of this model is that its penalized maximum likelihood estimation involves minimizing a non-convex objective function. To address it, this paper makes two contributions: (i) In spite of the non-convexity of estimation, we prove that an alternating minimization algorithm attains an estimator with the optimal statistical rate of convergence. Notably, such an estimator achieves estimation consistency with only one tensor sample, which was not observed in previous works. (ii) A novel de-biased statistical inference procedure with false discovery rate (FDR) control is proposed for testing true support of sparse precision matrices. Asymptotic normality of test statistic and consistency of FDR control are justified. These theoretical results are backed up by thorough simulations. We further illustrate the efficacy of our models through two real applications: neuroimaging studies of Autism spectrum disorder and users' clicking behavior analysis in online advertising. The proposed methods are encoded into a publicly available R package Tlasso.",2019,IEEE transactions on pattern analysis and machine intelligence
mi Decapod Crustacea from the International Indian Ocean Expedition,"Plankton collections from the Indian Ocean contain adults and larvae of three species of Thalassocaris: T. lucida (Dana), T. crinita (Dana) and T. obscura sp.n. The new species was previously confused with T. crinita by Borradaile and with T. lucida by Kemp. Larvae of Thalassocaris are described for the first time. In each species there are 10-13 zoeal stages. The cephalothorax is very broad and shallow, the maxilla has only one coxal endite, and exopods develop on legs 1-4. T. crinita is a shallow-water species with a wide distribution in the Indian Ocean and western Pacific. T. lucida and T. obscura are open ocean species. T. lucida is most common in the eastern Indian Ocean (and probably in the western Pacific) and is not recorded from the Arabian Sea. T. obscura is most common in the Arabian Sea and is not recorded from the south-eastern Indian Ocean or from the Pacific. Larval characters do not support the inclusion of Thalassocaris in the Pandalidae.

Network-based sparse Bayesian classification,"In some classification problems there is prior information about the joint relevance of groups of features. This knowledge can be encoded in a network whose nodes correspond to features and whose edges connect features that should be either both excluded or both included in the predictive model. In this paper, we introduce a novel network-based sparse Bayesian classifier (NBSBC) that makes use of the information about feature dependencies encoded in such a network to improve its prediction accuracy, especially in problems with a high-dimensional feature space and a limited amount of available training data. Approximate Bayesian inference is efficiently implemented in this model using expectation propagation. The NBSBC method is validated on four real-world classification problems from different domains of application: phonemes, handwritten digits, precipitation records and gene expression measurements. A comparison with state-of-the-art methods (support vector machine, network-based support vector machine and graph lasso) show that NBSBC has excellent predictive performance. It has the best accuracy in three of the four problems analyzed and ranks second in the modeling of the precipitation data. NBSBC also yields accurate and robust rankings of the individual features according to their relevance to the solution of the classification problem considered. The accuracy and stability of these estimates is an important factor in the good overall performance of this method.",2011,Pattern Recognit.
Sovereign co-risk measures in the Euro Area,"We propose a method to extract significant risk interactions between Countries adopting the Graphical Lasso algorithm, used in graph theory to sort out the spurious effect of common components.

Parametric and semi-parametric models for predicting genomic breeding values of complex traits in Nelore cattle,"Animal breeding aims to improve economic productivity of future generations of domestic species through selection. Most of the traits of economic interest in livestock have a complex and quantitative expression i.e. are influenced by a large number of genes and affected by environmental factors. Statistical analysis of phenotypes and pedigree information allows estimating the breeding values of the selection candidates based on infinitesimal model. A large amount of genomic data is now available for the identification and selection of genetically superior individuals with the potential to increase the accuracy of prediction of genetic values and thus, the efficiency of animal breeding programs. Numerous studies have been conducted in order to identify appropriate methodologies to specific breeds and traits, which will result in more accurate genomic estimated breeding values (GEBVs). Therefore, the objective of this study was to verify the possibility of applying semi-parametric models for genomic selection and to compare their ability of prediction with those of parametric models for real (carcass, meat quality, growth and reproductive traits) and simulated data. The phenotypic and pedigree information used were provided by farms belonging to four animal breeding programs which represent eleven farms. For carcass and meat quality traits, the data set contained 3,643 records for rib eye area (REA), 3,619 records for backfat thickness (BFT), 3,670 records for meat tenderness (TEN) and 3,378 observations for hot carcass weight (HCW). A total of 825,364 records for yearling weight (YW) and 166,398 for age at first calving (AFC) were used as growth and reproductive traits of Nelore cattle. Genotypes of 2,710, 2,656, 2,749, 2,495, 4,455 and 1,760 animals were available for REA, BFT, TEN, HCW, YW and AFC, respectively. After quality control, approximately 450,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) remained. Methods of analysis were genomic BLUP (GBLUP), single-step GBLUP (ssGBLUP), Bayesian LASSO (BL) and the semi-parametric approaches Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS) regression and Kernel Averaging (KA). A five-fold cross-validation with thirty random replicates was carried out and models were compared in terms of their prediction mean squared error (MSE) and accuracy of prediction (ACC). The ACC ranged from 0.39 to 0.40 (REA), 0.38 to 0.41 (BFT), 0.23 to 0.28 (TEN), 0.33 to 0.35 (HCW), 0.36 to 0.51 (YW) and 0.49 to 0.56 (AFC). For all traits, the GBLUP and BL models showed very similar prediction accuracies. For REA, BFT and HCW, models provided similar prediction accuracies, however RKHS regression had the best fit across traits considering multiple-step models and compared to KA. For traits which have a higher number of animals with phenotypes compared to the number of those with genotypes (YW and AFC), the ssGBLUP is indicated. Judged by overall performance, across all traits, the RKHS regression is particularly appealing for application in genomic selection, especially for low heritability traits. Simulated genotypes, pedigree, and phenotypes for four traits A, B, C and D were obtained using heritabilities based on real data (0.09, 0.12, 0.36 and 0.39 for each trait, respectively).

Psoralen plus UV-A-associated skin cancer: a likely role for human papillomavirus type 16?,"Weinstock et al 1 found human papillomavirus (HPV) (type 16 or a closely related type) in 22 of 30 skin lesions in a single patient in whom multiple skin cancers developed after prolonged therapy with psoralen plus UV-A (PUVA). Although this is an interesting observation, the question remains whether HPV-16 had a functional role in the development of these tumors. Several lines of evidence suggest that HPV-16 is unlikely to play a role in the development of skin cancer in most patients, immunosuppressed or not. The HPVs are highly host specific and show a remarkable degree of tissue specificity. Common mucosalassociated HPV types, including 16 and 18, are rarely found in keratinizing epithelia, even in chronically immunosuppressed renal transplant recipients, and, similarly, cutaneous HPV types are not found in the genital tract. Instead, recent studies implicate novel epidermodysplasia verruciformisâ€”related cutaneous HPVs in the development of transplant-associated skin cancers 2,3 found",1996,Archives of dermatology

Der Schalldampfer ist als ein langliches Rohr mit nicht perforierten Seitenwanden und Einlass- und Auslassstirnwanden ausgebildet. Die Auslassstirnwand besitzt eine Offnung, die so bemessen ist, um eine Steuerabgasstromung durch den Schalldampfer zu liefern, wahrend die Einlassstirnwand zumindest zwei Offnungen mit unterschiedlichen Grosen besitzt. Die Einlassoffnungen dienen dazu, die gesteuerte Gasstromung durchzulassen und eine destruktive Welleninterferenz zwischen den Durchflussstromen durch den Schalldampfer zu erzeugen, um ein durch turbulente Stromung erzeugtes Gerausch zu minimieren. Es sind auch verschiedene optionale Merkmale des Schalldampferaufbaus offenbart.",2003,
Infra-red multiphoton dissociation in focused Gaussian beams,"SummaryFor in-cell irradiation and focused beams, withE being the pulse energy, the dissociation yieldU obeys anE3/2-scale law only under definite conditions. A necessary (but not sufficient) condition is that, if Îµ0 > 0 is the threshold fluence of the process and Îµ the maximum of the local fluence, all points at which Îµ > Îµ0 fall into the reaction cell to exclude positively volume saturation of the dissociation due to the beam confinement. This is an important condition on the side of the high energies. On the side of the low energies, however, immediately above a threshold valueE0 ofE, under which dissociation does not occur, yield deviations from theE3/2-dependence are intrinsic to the beam structure in the waist (focal) region. Unlike other sources, no particular assumption is made as to the behaviourvs. Îµ of the local dissociation probabilityP from above Îµ0 up to the breakdown (P=1), but that it does not decrease with increasing Îµâ€²s. TheE3/2-dependence is, therefore, irrespective of the very particular Îµ-features ofP. These features indeed affect only the inferior limit ofE, E2, above which the yield may scale asE3/2. WhenE>E2 and the beam confinement allows it, geometrical optics can be adapted to produce the same results of the Gaussian propagation. Hence an immediate generalization of the results to focused laser outputs of any spatial structure is possible. Important parameters, such as the selectivity factors, have a definite meaning only in theE3/2-region. In the discussion of SF6 systems, the importance of parameters pointing out volume saturation, which may help to avoid misleading interpretations, is conveniently emphasized.RiassuntoPer irraggiamenti in cella con fasci focalizzati, indicando conE l'energia dell'impulso, la resa della dissociazioneU risulta proporzionale adE3/2 solo in determinate condizioni. Una condizione necessaria (ma non sufficiente) Ã¨ che, se Îµ0 > 0 Ã¨ la fluenza di soglia del processo ed Îµ Ã¨ il massimo della fluenza locale, tutti i punti con Îµ > Îµ0 cadano all'interno della cella di reazione affinchÃ© si possa escludere ogni saturazione di volume per la dissociazione, dovuta al confinamento del fascio. Questa Ã¨ una condizione importante dalla parte delle energie elevate. In quella invece delle basse energieâ€”immediatamente al di sopra di un valore di sogliaE0 diE, al di sotto del quale non avviene alcuna dissociazioneâ€”le deviazioni diU dalla menzionata legge di proporzionalitÃ  sono intrinseche alla struttura del fascio nella regione focale. A differenza di altri studi, nessuna particolare ipotesi Ã¨ fatta circa il comportamento della probabilitÃ  di dissociazione localeP nei riguardi di Îµ, da sopra Îµ0 fino al collasso (P=1), eccetto cheP Ã¨ una funzione non decrescente di Îµ. La leggeE3/2 risulta perciÃ² indifferente alla particolare natura diP. Questa infatti fissa solo il limite inferiore diE, E2, al di sopra del qualeU puÃ² variare comeE3/2. QuandoE>E2, ed il confinamento del fascio lo consente, l'ottica geometrica puÃ² essere adattata per ottenere gli stessi risultati dalla propagazione gaussiana. Da qui Ã¨ possibile una immediata generalizzazione dei risultati a fasci laser focalizzati di ogni struttura spaziale. Parametri importanti, quali i fattori di selettivitÃ , hanno un preciso significato solo nella regioneE3/2. Nella discussione di sistemi SF6 Ã¨ opportunamente sottolineata l'importanza di parametri indicativi della saturazione di volume che possono essere d'aiuto nell'evitare interpretazioni fuorvianti.Ð ÐµÐ·ÑŽÐ¼ÐµÐŸÑ€Ð¸ Ð¾Ð±Ð»ÑƒÑ‡ÐµÐ½Ð¸Ð¸ Ð² ÑÑ‡ÐµÐ¹ÐºÐµ Ñ„Ð¾ÐºÑƒÑÐ¸Ñ€Ð¾Ð²Ð°Ð½Ð½Ñ‹Ð¼ Ð¿ÑƒÑ‡ÐºÐ¾Ð¼ Ð²Ñ‹Ñ…Ð¾Ð´ Ð´Ð¸ÑÑÐ¾Ñ†Ð¸Ð°Ñ†Ð¸Ð¸U Ð¿Ð¾Ð´Ñ‡Ð¸Ð½ÑÐµÑ‚ÑÑ Ð·Ð°ÐºÐ¾Ð½ÑƒE3/2 Ñ‚Ð¾Ð»ÑŒÐºÐ¾ Ð¿Ñ€Ð¸ Ð¾Ð¿Ñ€ÐµÐ´ÐµÐ»ÐµÐ½Ð½Ñ‹Ñ… ÑƒÑÐ»Ð¾Ð²Ð¸ÑÑ…, Ð³Ð´ÐµE ÐµÑÑ‚ÑŒ ÑÐ½ÐµÑ€Ð³Ð¸Ñ Ð¸Ð¼Ð¿ÑƒÐ»ÑŒÑÐ°.

Model Selection with Piecewise Regular Gauges,"Regularization plays a pivotal role when facing the challenge of solving ill-posed inverse problems, where the number of observations is smaller than the ambient dimension of the object to be estimated. A line of recent work has studied regularization models with various types of low-dimensional structures. In such settings, the general approach is to solve a regularized optimization problem, which combines a data fidelity term and some regularization penalty that promotes the assumed low-dimensional/simple structure. This paper provides a general framework to capture this low-dimensional structure through what we coin piecewise regular gauges. These are convex, non-negative, closed, bounded and positively homogenous functions that will promote objects living on low-dimensional subspaces. This class of regularizers encompasses many popular examples such as the L^1 norm, L^1-L^2 norm (group sparsity), nuclear norm, as well as several others including the L^inf norm. We will show that the set of piecewise regular gauges is closed under addition and pre-composition by a linear operator, which allows to cover mixed regularization (e.g. sparse+low-rank), and the so-called analysis-type priors (e.g. total variation, fused Lasso, trace Lasso, bounded polyhedral gauges). Our main result presents a unified sharp analysis of exact and robust recovery of the low-dimensional subspace model associated to the object to recover from partial measurements. This analysis is illustrated on a number of special and previously studied cases.",2013,ArXiv

"European music, 1520-1640","The sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries - the so-called Golden Age of Polyphony - represent a time of great change and development in European music, with the flourishing of Orlando di Lasso, Palestrina, Byrd, Victoria, Monteverdi and Schutz among others. The thirty chapters of this book, contributed by established scholars on subjects within their fields of expertise, deal with polyphonic music - sacred and secular, vocal and instrumental - during this period. The volume offers chronological surveys of national musical cultures (in Italy, France, the Netherlands, Germany, England, and Spain); genre studies (Mass, motet, madrigal, chanson, instrumental music, opera); and is completed with essays on intellectual and cultural developments and concepts relevant to music (music theory, printing, the Protestant Reformation and the corresponding Catholic movement, humanism, concepts of 'Renaissance' and 'Baroque'). It thus provides a complete overview of the music and its context. The contributors include: Gary Tomlinson, James Haar, Tim Carter, Giulio Ongaro, Noel O'regan, Allan Atlas, Anthony Cummings, Richard Freedman, Jeanice Brooks, David Tunley, Kate Van Orden, Kristine Forney, Iain Fenlon, Karol Berger, Peter Bergquist, David Crook, Robin Leaver, Craig Monson, Todd Borgerding, Louise K.

Exploring bacterial community composition in Mediterranean deep-sea sediments and their role in heavy metal accumulation.,"The role of microbial processes in bioaccumulation of major and trace elements has been broadly demonstrated. However, microbial communities from marine sediments have been poorly investigated to this regard. In marine environments, particularly under high anthropogenic pressure, heavy metal accumulation increases constantly, which may lead to significant environmental issues. A better knowledge of bacterial diversity and its capability to bioaccumulate metals is essential to face environmental quality assessment. The oligotrophic westernmost Mediterranean, which is highly sensitive to environmental changes and subjected to increasing anthropogenic pressure, was selected for this study. A sediment core spanning the last two millennia was sampled at two intervals, with ages corresponding to 140 (S1) and 1400 (S2) yr BP. High-throughput sequencing showed an abundance of Bacillus, Micrococcus, unclassified members of Planococcaceae, Anaerolineaceae, Planctomycetaceae, Microlunatus, and Microbacterium in both intervals, with slight differences in their abundance, along with newly detected ones in S2, i.e., Propionibacterium, Fictibacillus, Thalassobacillus, and Bacteroides. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and co-occurrence patterns confirmed strong correlations among the taxa and the environmental parameters, suggesting either shared and preferred environmental conditions, or the performance of functions similar to or complementary to each other. These results were further confirmed using culture-dependent methods. The diversity of the culturable bacterial community revealed a predominance of Bacillus, and Micrococcus or Kocuria. The interaction of these bacterial communities with selected heavy metals (Cu, Cr, Zn and Pb) was also investigated, and their capacity of bioaccumulating metals within the cells and/or in the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) is demonstrated. Interestingly, biomineralization of Pb resulted in the precipitation of Pb phosphates (pyromorphite). Our study supports that remnants of marine bacterial communities can survive in deep-sea sediments over thousands of years. This is extremely important in terms of bioremediation, in particular when considering possible environmentally friendly strategies to bioremediate inorganic contaminants.",2019,The Science of the total environment
Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator as a Multivariate Calibration Tool for Simultaneous Determination of Diphenylamine and its Nitro Derivatives in Propellants,"Determination of diphenylamine (DPA) and its nitro derivatives received great attention for storing, deposition and on-time usage of propellants. Herein, we present a novel and simple method for simultaneous determination of DPA and its nitro derivatives in solid propellants using UV-Vis spectroscopy and chemometrics techniques. The UV-Vis spectra of the analytes revealed strong overlap and it was difficult to determine them individually in their mixture without any separation and purification. To tackle the overlapping problem in collected spectra, analysis of first-order UV-Vis data was performed using multivariate calibration techniques. In this way, principle component regression (PCR), different modes of partial least square (PLS) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) have been used for correlating the collected spectra to the concentration of DPAs in synthetic and real samples. The important variables were selected by confining the L1-norm of the regression coefficients in multivariate model via the shrinkage and selection operator in LASSO approach. The results obtained by LASSO regression technique in this work were superior to those obtained by different modes of PLS algorithm. Moreover, it is shown that LASSO can be used as a reliable variable selection and modeling technique in multivariate calibration studies. Generally, the proposed strategy in this work is simple, non-destructive, low-cost and rapid and can be effectively applied for simultaneous determination of DPA and its nitro derivatives in solid propellants.",2018,"Propellants, Explosives, Pyrotechnics"
"An Algorithmic Theory of Dependent Regularizers, Part 1: Submodular Structure","We present an exploration of the rich theoretical connections between several classes of regularized models, network flows, and recent results in submodular function theory. This work unifies key aspects of these problems under a common theory, leading to novel methods for working with several important models of interest in statistics, machine learning and computer vision. 
In Part 1, we review the concepts of network flows and submodular function optimization theory foundational to our results. We then examine the connections between network flows and the minimum-norm algorithm from submodular optimization, extending and improving several current results. This leads to a concise representation of the structure of a large class of pairwise regularized models important in machine learning, statistics and computer vision. 
In Part 2, we describe the full regularization path of a class of penalized regression problems with dependent variables that includes the graph-guided LASSO and total variation constrained models. This description also motivates a practical algorithm. This allows us to efficiently find the regularization path of the discretized version of TV penalized models. Ultimately, our new algorithms scale up to high-dimensional problems with millions of variables.",2013,arXiv: Machine Learning
"Molecular phylogeny of trigonostomine turbellarians (Platyhelminthes: Rhabdocoela: Trigonostomidae), including four new species from the Northeast Pacific Ocean","Rhabdocoels comprise a species-rich group of microturbellarians in marine habitats around the globe. Knowledge of their species diversity in the Northeast Pacific Ocean is limited to a few studies. Here we present nine species within Trigonostominae and one species within Brinkmanniellinae associated with intertidal algae, sandy beaches and mudflats from the coast of British Columbia and Washington. Four species, Trigonostomum tillicum sp. nov., Ceratopera cascadiensis sp. nov., Ceratopera complicata sp. nov. and Ptychopera unicornis sp. nov., are new to science and are established based on molecular data and distinctive traits associated with the stylet and bursal appendage. Furthermore, we report on the occurrence of Trigonostomum tori, Ceratopera axi, Ceratopera pilifera, Ceratopera pacifica comb. nov., Ptychopera japonica and Tvaerminnea karlingi and provide new data on their morphology. A molecular phylogenetic analysis of Trigonostominae and other Thalassotyphloplanida using 18S rRNA and partial 28S rRNA sequences from 42 species demonstrates the phylogenetic positions of the four new species in addition to other interand intrageneric relationships within Trigonostominae (e.g. Messoplana is embedded within Ceratopera). This molecular phylogenetic context enables us to reassess homology statements about stylet morphology and the organization of the afferent system within Trigonostominae.",2018,Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society

An empirical Bayes method for estimating epistatic effects of quantitative trait loci.,"The genetic variance of a quantitative trait is often controlled by the segregation of multiple interacting loci. Linear model regression analysis is usually applied to estimating and testing effects of these quantitative trait loci (QTL). Including all the main effects and the effects of interaction (epistatic effects), the dimension of the linear model can be extremely high. Variable selection via stepwise regression or stochastic search variable selection (SSVS) is the common procedure for epistatic effect QTL analysis. These methods are computationally intensive, yet they may not be optimal. The LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) method is computationally more efficient than the above methods. As a result, it has been widely used in regression analysis for large models. However, LASSO has never been applied to genetic mapping for epistatic QTL, where the number of model effects is typically many times larger than the sample size. In this study, we developed an empirical Bayes method (E-BAYES) to map epistatic QTL under the mixed model framework. We also tested the feasibility of using LASSO to estimate epistatic effects, examined the fully Bayesian SSVS, and reevaluated the penalized likelihood (PENAL) methods in mapping epistatic QTL. Simulation studies showed that all the above methods performed satisfactorily well. However, E-BAYES appears to outperform all other methods in terms of minimizing the mean-squared error (MSE) with relatively short computing time. Application of the new method to real data was demonstrated using a barley dataset.",2007,Biometrics
Helping Naive Users to Reuse Ontology Design Patterns,"The decisive launching of the Semantic Web depends on two key factors: the design of sound methodologies for guiding users in the reuse of available knowledge resources that speed up the ontology development, and the suitability of those methodologies for an average user. In this paper we propose a method for the reuse of ontology design patterns aimed at users with little expertise in ontology development, i.e. naive users. The method workflow is explained in the light of some examples of reuse of logical ontology design patterns: the SubClassOf relation, Exhaustive Classes and Disjoint Classes patterns.",2008,
