Additive Models for Quantile Regression: An Analysis of Risk Factors for Malnutrition in India,"This brief report describes some recent developments of the R quantreg package to incorporate methods for additive models. The methods are illustrated with an application to modeling childhood malnutrition in India. Models with additive nonparametric effects offer a valuable dimension re- duction device throughout applied statistics. In this paper we describe some recent developments of additive models for quantile regression. These meth- ods employ the total variation smoothing penalties introduced in (9) for uni- variate components and (7) for bivariate components. We focus on selection of smoothing parameters including lasso-type selection of parametric compo- nents, and on post selection inference methods. Additive models have received considerable attention since their intro- duction by Hastie and Tibshirani (1986, 1990). They provide a pragmatic approach to nonparametric regression modeling; by restricting nonparamet- ric components to be composed of low-dimensional additive pieces we can circumvent some of the worst aspects of the notorious curse of dimension- ality. It should be emphasized that we use the word ""circumvent"" advisedly, in full recognition that we have only swept difficulties under the rug by the assumption of additivity. When conditions for additivity are violated there will obviously be a price to pay.",2010,
Predicting disability progression in multiple sclerosis: Insights from advanced statistical modeling.,"BACKGROUND
There is an unmet need for precise methods estimating disease prognosis in multiple sclerosis (MS).


OBJECTIVE
Using advanced statistical modeling, we assessed the prognostic value of various clinical measures for disability progression.


METHODS
Advanced models to assess baseline prognostic factors for disability progression over 2â€‰years were applied to a pooled sample of patients from placebo arms in four different phase III clinical trials. least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and ridge regression, elastic nets, support vector machines, and unconditional and conditional random forests were applied to model time to clinical disability progression confirmed at 24â€‰weeks. Sensitivity analyses for different definitions of a combined endpoint were carried out, and bootstrap was used to assess prediction model performance.


RESULTS
A total of 1582 patients were included, of which 434 (27.4%) had disability progression in a combined endpoint over 2â€‰years. Overall model discrimination performance was relatively poor (all C-indicesâ€‰â©½â€‰0.65) across all models and across different definitions of progression.


CONCLUSION
Inconsistency of prognostic factor importance ranking confirmed the relatively poor prediction ability of baseline factors in modeling disease progression in MS. Our findings underline the importance to explore alternative predictors as well as alternative definitions of commonly used endpoints.",2019,Multiple sclerosis

New Records of Fishes from the Hawaiian Islands,"The following fishes represent new records for the Hawaiian Islands: the moray eel Lycodontis javanicus (Bleeker), the frogfish Antennarius nummifer (Cuvier), the jack Carangoides ferdau (Forssk::U), the grouper Cromileptes altivelis (Cuvier) (probably an aquarium release), the chubs Kyphosus cinerascens (Forsskal) and K. vaigiensis (Quoy and Gaimard), the armorhead Pentaceros richardsoni Smith, the goatfish Upeneus vittatus (Forsskal) (a probable unintentional introduction by the Division of Fish and Game, State of Hawaii), the wrasse Halichoeres marginatus Ruppell,' the gobies Nemateleotris magnifica Fowler and Discordipinna griessingeri Hoese and Fourmanoir, the angelfish Centropyge multicolor Randall and Wass, the surgeonfish Acanthurus lineatus (Linnaeus), the oceanic cutlassfish Assurger anzac (Alexander), and the driftfish Hyperoglyphe japonica (Doderlein). In addition, the snapper Pristipomoides auricilla (Jordan, Evermann, and Tanaka) and the wrasse Thalassoma quinquevittatum (Lay and Bennett), both overlooked in recent compilations, are shown to be valid species for the Hawaiian region.

Randall (1976) reviewed the additions to, and alterations in, the nomenclature of the Hawaiian fish fauna to 1975. Papers are cited that add 25 species of fishes to the Hawaiian fauna as new species, new records, or species overlooked by Gosline and Brock or regarded erroneously as junior synonyms. Randall (1976) does not mention the first record of the muraenid eel Lycodontis javanicus (Bleeker) from the Hawaiian Islands cited by Brock (1972) in his M.S. thesis, because the author believed that this would be published by Brock. Since it has not been, this record is given here (though still attributed to Brock). Brock had two Hawaiian specimens. One is BPBM 13318, 143 mm total length, collected off Waikiki, Oahu, by W. A. Gosline and ichthyology class on 27 September 1962. The other, 2160 mm total length and weighing 29 kg, was not retained (though it is illustrated in Brock 1972). The Bernice P.

Series No . 238 Liquid Geographies : India in the Oceanic Imaginary,"In the construction of national space, is there a contrast between continental and oceanic determinants? I consider this question by looking at how India was conceptualized, conceived, imaged, and imagined in the first half of the 20th century, before it became independent. More specifically, how did the idea of India came to be articulated from two ends of the Indian Ocean, by M. K. Gandhi in South Africa, and, later, by Subhas Chandra Bose in Singapore? Gandhi was the author of the seminal anti-colonial and, some might add, anti-modern text, Hind Swaraj (1909). Bose became the commander of the Azad Hind Fauj also known as the Indian National Army. Though these leaders belong to two different ideological and discursive traditions, what united them was anti-imperialism and â€œcolourfulâ€ cosmopolitanism. I argue that their work as not just normatively constitutive of the Indian nation, but that it might more fruitfully be seen as part of an older, looser, and more fluid Indian Oceanic cross-currents of cultural formation and circulation. These networks are today almost forgotten, with the end of empire and the rise of independent nations in the Indian Ocean system. Yet, it is of vital importance to reconsider, if not resurrect, them if we wish to arrive at a better understanding not just of the Indian Ocean but of Asia. This presentation, with the help of both textual and visual sources, illustrates how the national space was shaped by geo-critical politics, by oceanic hybridity, and by a special type of anti-imperial, colourful cosmopolitanism. The space which gave rise to such discourses constitutes a vital link between world shaped by Western imperialism and the post-national world which we might regard as coming into being before our very eyes and one of whose key constituents is signified by the â€œshifterâ€ term, â€œthe Global South.â€ ARI Working Paper No. 238 Asia Research Institute â— Singapore 4 As a part of what Markus P. M. Vink wink called â€œIndian Ocean Studies and the â€˜New Thalassology,â€™â€ I wish to ask if there a contrast between continental and oceanic perspectives, especially in the way in which nations are imagined? I propose to raise this question by looking at how India was conceptualized, conceived, imaged, and imagined from two ends of the Indian Ocean, M. K. Gandhi in South Africa and Subhas Chandra Bose in Singapore. Gandhi was the author of the seminal anticolonial and, some might add, anti-modern text, Hind Swaraj (1909). Bose became the commander of the Azad Hind Fauj also known as the Indian National Army, announcing the provincial government of free India from Singapore in October 1943. Though these leaders belong to two different ideological and discursive traditions, what united them was anti-imperialism and â€œcolourfulâ€ cosmopolitanism. The term â€œcolourful cosmopolitanismâ€ itself is of recent coinage, first used by Sugata Bose â€œto evoke a kind of cosmopolitanism that springs from vernacular roots and is compatible with the best traditions of anti-colonial nationalismâ€ (â€œRabindranath Tagore and Asian Universalismâ€ 18). Nico Slateâ€™s Colored Cosmopolitanism: The Shared Struggle for Freedom in the United States and India (2012) is a valuable contribution in this regard, showing transnational and trans-continental connections and alliances among blacks and Indians against colonialism. Such an idea of cosmopolitanism is quite at variance with Martha Nussbaumâ€™s 1994 essay in which she claimed that â€œCosmopolitanism ... offers only reason and the love of humanity, which may seem at times less colorful than other sources of belongingâ€ (161). Both Gandhi and Bose, eventually, constituted not so much discordant, but interconnected strands in Indiaâ€™s freedom struggle. I argue that their work as not just normatively constitutive of the Indian nation, but that it might more fruitfully be seen as part of an older, looser, and more fluid Indian Oceanic cross-currents of cultural formation and circulation. These networks are today almost forgotten, with the end of empire and the rise of independent nations in the Indian Ocean system. Yet, it is of vital importance to reconsider, if not resurrect, them if we wish to arrive at a better understanding not just of the Indian Ocean but of Asia. I am also concerned with the dialogical relationship between imaging and imagining, specifically with how images contributed to national imaginaries in the first half of the 20 century, before it became independent. This paper, with the help of visual sources, illustrates how texts and activities by leaders like Gandhi and Bose helped to fashion the nation that India became. This nation was shaped not only by an oceanic hybridity, but by a special type of anti-imperial, colourful cosmopolitanism. The space which gave rise to such discourses constitutes a vital link between a world before Western imperialism and the globalized world of the future which we might regard as coming into being before our very eyes after Western hegemony. 1 I develop this idea at greater length in my book, â€œCultural Politics in Modern India: Postcolonial Prospects, Colourful Cosmopolitanism, Global Proximitiesâ€ (New Delhi and London: Routledge, forthcoming). I am deeply grateful to Professor John D. Kelly for his wide-ranging and detailed comments on this paper. 2 Throughout this paper, I use â€œoceanicâ€ both as a cognitive metaphor and as an actual geo-spatial site, with the relation between the two left multivalent. See George Lakoff and Mark Johnso, whose opening observation in â€œThe Metaphorical Structure of the Human Conceptual System,â€ is worth recalling: â€œthe human conceptual system ... is fundamentally metaphorical in characterâ€ (195). ARI Working Paper No. 238 Asia Research Institute â— Singapore 5 The Indian Ocean has been characterized as â€œthe ocean of notionsâ€ and â€œcradle of globalization.â€ As it begins to reveal its own stories to us, we start seeing it not only as a geo-political, but cultural and conceptual space. It allows, even invites us, to evolve an alternative paradigm of area studies from the perspective of post-colonial societies so as to promote a holistic understanding of Asia, a vast and complex continent, which demands a multi-disciplinary, multi-cultural, and multi-lingual methodology to understand it. It would be useful to invoke here a note circulated by the late svarajist scholar-researcher, Dharampal, several years back, but revised in September 2003. Dharampal argued that Indiaâ€™s relations with its large neighbourhood both to its West and East constitute what might be termed as an enduring Indian Ocean oecumene. He advocated a reorienation of Indian scholarship so that this region could be studied more seriously, with a view to understanding the the social, cultural, political, and economic structure of this region. According to Dharampal: Such a recovery of knowledge and self-awareness requires a major scholarly effort to work on this past in all its manifestations and detail, say from 1500 AD backwards to 600 BC. Regaining of such knowledge would require search of original sources not only in India, but initially perhaps much more in China, Korea, Japan, S.E. Asia, etc, where such sources seem to be more known and perused by scholars in recent times. In this ambitious, even daunting project, scholars from several countries would need to work together. It is such a spirit of cooperation that will create a new, non-Western and truly â€œAsianâ€ Asian Studies. As much recent work in a variety of disciplines shows, region-making is comprised of multiscalar networks, marked by coalitional and conflictual webbing. Prasenjit Duara, for instance, observes, â€œNetworks in this sense are effective carriers of circulatory histories not only because they can cross various boundaries of territories, institutions and ideologies but also because their effects ... can produce unexpected coalitional resultsâ€ (242). He goes on to speak more specifically of how networks in maritime Asia produced space. When capitalism and imperialism triumphed over the vast breadth of the continent, these older networks were coopted and harnessed to the new â€œterritorial organizational systemsâ€; even so, â€œsome of these networks continued to maintain their transborder and multiscalar character, and in the current era of hyperconnectivity, networks have become a new force to be reckoned withâ€ (242-243). Thus, Dharampalâ€™s older call, with its antiimperalistic overtones, resonates with scholarly trends in recent times, trying to emphasize circulatory, global histories over nationalistically confined narratives. Apart from attending more closely to oceanic rather than continental stories, my second major thrust in this exercise is that I wish to incline to visual in additional to textual sources. Such a move follows another strand of scholarship which examines the manner in which visual histories sometimes compliment, sometimes contradict, but always inflect the more official textual accounts. It would therefore be useful to see how the optical archives of the Indian Ocean impact the more authoritative and familiar textual histories. In Photographyâ€™s Other Histories (2003), Christopher Pinney and Nicholas Peterson offer a useful starting point that signals, to use Arjun Appaduraiâ€™s phrase, â€œvisual decolonization.â€ What is implied is a way of reading visual images so that they 3 Shanti Moorthy and Ashraf Jamal adapt the phrase â€œocean of notionsâ€ from Salman Rushdieâ€™s Haroun and the Sea of Stories in their Introduction to Indian Ocean Studies: Cultural, Social, and Political Perspectives (2010); like Rashid in Rushdieâ€™s story, the Indian Ocean too â€œbecomes its own storytellerâ€ (3, 20). â€œCradle of globalizationâ€ is used in Lee Cassanelli et al., â€œIndian Ocean: Cradle of Globalization,â€ http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/indianocean (Moorthy and Jamal 25).

Machine Learning based Performance Modeling of Flash SSDs,"Flash memory based solid state drives(SSDs) have alleviated the I/O bottleneck by exploiting its data parallel design. In an enterprise environment, Flash SSD used in the form of a hybrid storage architecture to achieve the better performance with lower cost. In this architecture, I/O load balancing is one of the important factors. However, the internal parallelism distorts the performance measures of the flash SSDs. Despite the criticality of load balancing on I/O intensive environments, these studies have rarely been addressed. In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of applying classification method using machine learning techniques to the I/O saturation estimation by using Linux kernel I/O statistics instead of the utilization measure that is currently used for HDDs. We conclude that machine learning techniques that we employed (Support Vector Machine and LASSO Generalized Linear Model) performs well compared to the existing utilization measure even we cannot collect the internal information of the flash SSDs.",2017,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management

51â€…Does degree of low amplitude atrial voltage correlate with poor left atrial function in atrial fibrillation?,"Background Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) frequently have atrial scarring characterised by discrete regions of low voltage. Pre-existing left atrial scarring is an independent predictor of pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) failure. Novel mapping algorithms have also been developed to assess the degree of atrial fibrosis. This may be expressed as a percentage of the total left atrial (LA) volume mapped. In addition to the electrical remodelling seen, structural remodelling occurs, with dilatation and reduced function. The most accurate determinant of LA function is debated, but the most frequently used method is transmitral A Wave velocity on pulsed-wave Doppler. The relationship between LA function and electrical changes seen in AF has not been defined. Methods This was a single centre observational study. Left atrial voltage maps were created in patients undergoing PVI for the first time in the Mater Private Hospital between August 2016 and April 2017. LA voltage maps were initially created with a Lasso catheter with some further points taken with a Smarttouch ablation catheter (both Biosense Webster, Diamond Bar, California). Voltage greater than 0.5 mV was accepted as normal tissue and voltages < 0.2 mV scar. After creation of the voltage maps, the percentage scar was assessed using a novel computer algorithm (Biosense Webster). Pre-ablation echocardiograms were studied and the LA function was assessed by measuring the trans-mitral pulse wave Doppler. Assessments were only made in sinus rhythm. Results Out of 96 patients who had undergone PVI, only 24 were found to have had sinus rhythm on pre-procedural echo. The mean age was 63.5 (standard deviation or SD 10.6) years. 66% of the group were men. 58% had paroxysmal AF. The mean amplitude of the A-wave in the study was 0.61 (SD 0.16) ms-1. An average of 1269.7 (SD 857.0) mapping points were taken. The mean LA percentage scar was 25.1 (SD 20.3) %. Using linear regression, adjusted for age at time of procedure, there was a significant negative association between a wave (in ms-1) and % LA scar (Beta coefficient -72.44, 95% CI -122.99 to -21.88, p=0.007). Using pairwise correlation, the correlation coefficient between LA scar and A wave was -0.38, p=0.06. Abstract 51 Figure 1 Two-way scatterplot with fitted regression line between left atrial scar and transmitral A wave velocity. A wave measure in ms-1, LA scar expressed as a percentage Conclusion Our study found an inverse correlation between transmitral A wave and degree of left atrial scarring when LA function was adjusted for patient age, indicating that LA electrical remodelling as measure by percentage scar is associated with decreased LA function in patients with AF. However, there were only 24 patients in this study and ongoing research with more patients is warranted to further substantiate this.",2017,Heart
Meta-analytic framework for sparse K-means to identify disease subtypes in multiple transcriptomic studies.,"Disease phenotyping by omics data has become a popular approach that potentially can lead to better personalized treatment. Identifying disease subtypes via unsupervised machine learning is the first step towards this goal. In this paper, we extend a sparse K-means method towards a meta-analytic framework to identify novel disease subtypes when expression profiles of multiple cohorts are available. The lasso regularization and meta-analysis identify a unique set of gene features for subtype characterization. An additional pattern matching reward function guarantees consistent subtype signatures across studies. The method was evaluated by simulations and leukemia and breast cancer data sets. The identified disease subtypes from meta-analysis were characterized with improved accuracy and stability compared to single study analysis. The breast cancer model was applied to an independent METABRIC dataset and generated improved survival difference between subtypes. These results provide a basis for diagnosis and development of targeted treatments for disease subgroups.",2016,Journal of the American Statistical Association

"A maritime cultural landscape of Cochinchina: The South China Sea, maritime routes, navigation, and boats in pre colonial central Vietnam","This thesis depicts aspects of maritime life along the coast of central Vietnam, Cochinchina, between the 16th and the 19th centuries. The aim of the thesis is to provide a general understanding of the traditional use of boats, and in doing so, the thesis examines from several vantage points maritime routes, the characteristics of the South China Sea and its navigation, various maritime activities, Cochinchinese seafaring and seamanship, and finally, the boats themselves. 
 
Between the 16th and the 19th centuries, maritime activity along the coast of Cochinchina was bustling. Boats were central to the development of the region under the reign of the Nguyá»…n Lords (1558-1776) up to the early years of the Nguyá»…n Dynasty (1802-1945), for defence and expansion, for trade, and for sustaining daily life. Concurrently, Europeans in the age of sail followed the traditional maritime route to China that hugged the coast of Cochinchina, and often sailed into its harbours. 
 
In this thesis, the maritime aspect is the component that links these various topics together. As such, it uses a framework initiated by the Annales School, and deepened by the New Thalassology. Within that framework, the sea is considered as a fundamental force that shaped life along the coast, and the South China Sea is thus central to this thesis. At the same time, the methodology relies on a multi-disciplinary approach that draws upon a range of sources, in order to address a particular region of Vietnam over the longue duree. The thesis therefore draws upon archival documents, including travellersâ€™ accounts, missionariesâ€™ letters, and embassiesâ€™ reports from the French, the Spanish, the Portuguese, the Dutch and the English, to reconstruct a sense of the navigation conditions on the South China Sea, along the coast of central Vietnam, and to shed light on the boats and mariners that sailed there. It also draws upon ethnography, from the 19th century to the present, to address the continuity of navigation, boat use, and Cochinchinese specific boatbuilding features over time. 
 
As such, this thesis illuminates the maritime past of Cochinchina from a maritime perspective, and by making the multi-disciplinary study of boat use its centrepiece, it stands at the cross-roads of maritime archaeology, nautical technology and maritime history.",2016,

With the generalized-screen (GS)approach, theaccuracy of thephase-screen methodis extendedto larger-contrast,wider-angle,andback-scattering. We proposehereto extend the GS methodfurther to anisotropic media,in particularto transverselyisotropicmediawith a vertical symmetryaxis (VTI media).The enhancedaccuracy accomplishedby theGSapproachbecomesanecessityin theapplicationto VTI media. Our approachaccounts for the first class of multiple scatteringthrough use of the generalizedBremmer series (De Hoop, 1996), and for the secondclass of multipathingby meansof theGSpropagation(DeHoopetal., 1999; Le Rousseau& De Hoop,1999).Examplesof implementation of theBremmerserieswith theone-waywaveoperatorapproximatedwith theGSmethodcanbe found in Le Rousseauand De Hoop (1999).Here,we only considerthe first term of the Bremmerseriesassociatedwith theone-waywaveoperatorthat modelstransversescattering.

Development and Validation of a Prediction Pneumothorax Model in CT-Guided Transthoracic Needle Biopsy for Solitary Pulmonary,"Computed tomography-guided transthoracic needle biopsy (CT-TNB) is widely used in the diagnosis of solitary pulmonary nodule (SPN). However, CT-TNB-induced pneumothorax occurs frequently. This study aimed to establish a predictive model for pneumothorax following CT-TNB for SPN. The prediction model was developed in a cohort that consisted of 311 patients with SPN who underwent CT-TNB. An independent external validation cohort contained 227 consecutive patients. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) regression analysis was used for data dimension reduction and predictors selection. Multivariable logistic regression was used to develop the predictive model, which was presented with a nomogram. Area under the curve (AUC) was used to determine the discrimination of the proposed model. The calibration was used to test the goodnessof-fit of themodel, and decision curve analysis (DCA)was used for evaluating its clinical usefulness. Five variables (age, diagnosis of nodule, puncture times, puncture distance, and puncture position) were filtered by Lasso regression. AUC of the predictive model and the validation were 0.801 (95%CI, 0.738-0.865) and 0.738 (95%CI, 0.656-0.820), respectively.Themodel was well-calibrated (P > 0.05), and DCA demonstrated its clinical usefulness. Thus, this predictive model might facilitate the individualized preoperative prediction of pneumothorax in CT-TNB for SPN.",2019,
Quantile universal threshold for model selection,"Efficient recovery of a low-dimensional structure from high-dimensional data has been pursued in various settings including wavelet denoising, generalized linear models and low-rank matrix estimation. By thresholding some parameters to zero, estimators such as lasso, elastic net and subset selection allow to perform not only parameter estimation but also variable selection, leading to sparsity. Yet one crucial step challenges all these estimators: the choice of the threshold parameter~$\lambda$. If too large, important features are missing; if too small, incorrect features are included. 
Within a unified framework, we propose a new selection of $\lambda$ at the detection edge under the null model. To that aim, we introduce the concept of a zero-thresholding function and a null-thresholding statistic, that we explicitly derive for a large class of estimators. The new approach has the great advantage of transforming the selection of $\lambda$ from an unknown scale to a probabilistic scale with the simple selection of a probability level. Numerical results show the effectiveness of our approach in terms of model selection and prediction.",2015,arXiv: Methodology
Fixation of the coronoid process in elbow fracture-dislocations.,"BACKGROUND
Terrible triad injuries consist of a posterior dislocation of the elbow, a coronoid fracture, and a radial head fracture. The coronoid plays a pivotal role as an anterior buttress, yet the optimal management of the coronoid fracture remains unknown. We hypothesize that suture lasso fixation of the coronoid fracture leads to fewer complications and improved outcomes compared with screw or suture anchor fixation techniques.


METHODS
A retrospective chart review performed at three tertiary care centers identified forty consecutive patients treated for terrible triad injuries of the elbow with a minimum follow-up of eighteen months (mean, twenty-four months; range, eighteen to fifty-three months). All patients were managed with a standard approach consisting of: (1) repair or replacement of the radial head; (2) repair of the lateral ulnar collateral ligament (LUCL) of the elbow; and (3) repair of the coronoid fracture with one of two techniques: Group I (n = 28) consisted of the ""lasso"" technique and Group II (n = 12) consisted of open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) with screws or suture anchors.


RESULTS
For the study population, the mean postoperative arc of elbow motion was 115Â° (range, 75Â° to 140Â°), the average Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score was 16 (range, 0 to 43), and the average Broberg-Morrey score was 90 (range, 64 to 100). For repair of the coronoid fracture, the suture lasso technique was more stable than the other techniques intraoperatively, both before (p < 0.05) and after (p < 0.05) LUCL repair, and at the final follow-up (p < 0.05). ORIF was associated with a higher prevalence of implant failure (p < 0.05), and suture anchors were associated with a higher prevalence of malunion and nonunion (p < 0.05).


CONCLUSIONS
For terrible triad injuries, greater stability with fewer complications was achieved with use of the suture lasso technique for coronoid fracture fixation.",2011,The Journal of bone and joint surgery. American volume
"Birds observed at Scott Island, Ross Sea, Antarctica","The island is surrounded by precipitous cliffs and over half the area above the cliffs is ice-capped. There are small coves with beaches on the northeastern coast and opposite Haggits Pillar on the western coast of the island. Both beaches are probably covered by ice for much of the year and wave-washed by storms when ice free. Two hundred and fifty metres west of the island is Haggits Pillar, which rises to 62 m. We report on two visits to Scott Island. The first on 2 February 1967 when P.C.H. circled the island about 750 m offshore aboard the USNS Eltanin and approached to within 300 m by dory but was unable to go ashore. The second on 7 January 1982 when we were both part of a team of New Zealand and USA scientists who spent two hours (09h00â€“11h00 NZST) ashore. In 1982 we visited both beaches and searched for birds along the entire coastline during low-level helicopter circuits. In 1967 six birds (two Antarctic Petrels Thalassoica antarctica, two Antarctic Prions Pachyptila desolata and two Wilsonâ€™s Storm Petrels Oceanites oceanicus) were collected from a dory about 300 m from Scott Island. All six birds had brood patches and active gonads. These specimens are now held at the Museum of New Zealand, Wellington.",1996,Marine ornithology
Confidence Regions in Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Estimation,"Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization (DRO) estimators are obtained as solutions of min-max problems in which the statistician selects a parameter minimizing the worst-case loss among all probability models within a certain distance (in a Wasserstein sense) from the underlying empirical measure. While motivated by the need to identify model parameters (or) decision choices that are robust to model uncertainties and misspecification, the Wasserstein DRO estimators recover a wide range of regularized estimators, including square-root LASSO and support vector machines, among others, as particular cases. This paper studies the asymptotic normality of underlying DRO estimators as well as the properties of an optimal (in a suitable sense) confidence region induced by the Wasserstein DRO formulation.",2019,arXiv: Statistics Theory
"Citrus Gummosis disease severity classification using participatory sensing, remote sensing and weather data","Phythophthora disease, Gummosis, in Citrus crop results in huge yield losses every year. The purpose of this study is to detect the Gummosis disease infested fields using remote sensing and meteorological data. We present the use of participatory sensing framework to collect the reliable ground truth data about the disease incidences. Various vegetation, soil and water indices have been derived from Landsat-8 data and morphometric parameters of watershed from ASTER DEM. These parameters along with meteorological data are used as a large feature set which is then reduced using the LASSO and Elastic Net regularization techniques. We evaluate SVM, Naive Bayes and ANN based classifiers for three class classification between healthy, low and high disease infested fields. Results depicts that a combination of LASSO regularization with ANN classifier outscores the other approaches considered in this paper.",2016,2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
"Elassoma zonatum, E. okefenokee, and E. evergladei: Habitats and Comparative Observations","The species in the genus Elassoma include fishes with a maximum length of 4.5 cm, and which occur only in the southeastern USA. All species have a well-developed sexual dimorphism, in which the males at the time of courtship have iridescent blue markings on a weak black background color. The females always have a camouflaging coloration of beiges and browns. Besides the brilliant colors of the males and the small sizes of these species, it is primarily the â€flutteringâ€ movements during courtship that makes these fishes such appealing and interesting aquarium fishes. The most well-known representative is E. evergladei, which in Germany has excited a small circle of enthusiasts for over 60 years. In the meantime, six species in the genus have become known (E. evergladei, E. okefenokee, E. zonatum, E. okatie, E. boehlkei, E. sp. â€œSpring Pygmy Sunfishâ€), which have been separated from the sunfish family and raised to the level of their own family, the Elassomatidae (for example, Rohde and Arndt 1987, Avise et al. 1977, Johnson 1983). Since the previously used reference â€œpygmy sunfishesâ€ is misleading, it should in the future be replaced by â€œpygmy black perches.â€ Three of the named species (E. evergladei, E. okefenokee, E. zonatum) were found by the authors in their natural habitat and brought to Germany. Here we present observations of them in the wild and their behavior and rearing in the aquarium. Photos on p.17.",2016,
Scalable MCMC for Bayes Shrinkage Priors,"Gaussian scale mixture priors are frequently employed in Bayesian analysis of high-dimensional models, and a theoretical literature exists showing optimal risk properties of several members of this family in $p \gg n$ settings when the truth is sparse. However, while implementations of frequentist methods such as the Lasso can scale to dimension in the hundreds of thousands, corresponding Bayesian methods that use MCMC for computation are often limited to problems at least an order of magnitude smaller. This is in large part due to convergence toward unity of the spectral gap of the associated Markov kernel as the dimension grows. Here we propose an MCMC algorithm for computation in these models that combines blocked Gibbs, Metropolis-Hastings, and slice sampling. Our algorithm has computational cost per step comparable to the best existing alternatives, but superior convergence properties, giving effective sample sizes of 50 to 100 fold larger for identical computation time. Moreover, the convergence rate of our algorithm deteriorates much more slowly than alternatives as the dimension grows. We illustrate the scalability of the algorithm in simulations with up to 20,000 predictors.",2017,arXiv: Computation
Juvenile fish in Cystoseira forests: influence of habitat complexity and depth on fish behaviour and assemblage composition,"The sublittoral forests formed by the fucoid algae Cystoseira spp. are important juvenile habitats for many Mediterranean fish species. However, the spatial variability of juvenile fish assemblages within the forests and the potential environmental drivers, such as depth and habitat complexity, remain poorly understood. We estimated densities, sizes and behaviours of juvenile fish assemblages in subtidal (0-15 meters) Cystoseira brachycarpa var. balearica forests in north Minorca Island (North-western Mediterranean Sea) over two consecutive autumns (2012 and 2013). Depth and forest complexity, here measured as canopy volume, had both a significant and independent effect on the juvenile fish assemblages in terms of species abundance composition and body size. Assemblages found in the shallowest depth range (3-4m) were characterized by greater densities of the ornate wrasse Thalassoma pavo, while those deeper (10-12m) had higher densities of the rainbow wrasse Coris julis , independently of its size composition. Juveniles of both species were more abundant in less complex forests; conversely juveniles of wrasses of the genus Symphodus were more abundant in more complex forests. The smallest sizes of T. pavo occurred in the most complex forests. On the other hand, our results demonstrated that juvenile fish behaviours were unrelated to the complexity of the Cystoseira forests but mainly related to the body length. The effects of body length on behaviour were however species dependent. Cryptic and transitory behaviours were mostly observed in the smallest and largest juveniles of T. pavo and C. julis , respectively, while the behaviour of Symphodus spp. was unrelated to their body length. Our study emphasises the importance of preserving healthy Cystoseira forests and their intrinsic patchy nature, as this habitat, with its mosaic of different complexity degrees and bathymetrical variability, enable the presence of different fish species at various life stages.",2019,Mediterranean Marine Science
A clinical-radiomic model for improved prognostication of surgical candidates with colorectal liver metastases.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
Colorectal cancer with liver metastases is potentially curable with surgical resection however clinical prognostic factors can insufficiently stratify patients. This study aims to assess whether radiomic features are prognostic and can inform clinical decision making.


METHODS
This single-site retrospective study included 102 patients who underwent colorectal liver metastases resection with preoperative computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with gadoxetic acid (EOB) and clinical covariates. A lasso-regularized multivariate Cox proportional hazards model was applied to 114 features (10 clinical, 104 radiomic) to determine association with disease-free survival (DFS). A prognostic index was derived using the significant Cox regression coefficients and their corresponding input features and a threshold was determined to classify patients into high- and low-risk groups, and DFS compared using log-rank tests.


RESULTS
Four covariates were significantly associated with DFS; bilobar disease (hazard ratio [HR]=â€‰1.56; Pâ€‰=â€‰.0043), complete pathological response (HR=â€‰0.67; Pâ€‰=â€‰.025), minimum pixel value (HR=â€‰1.66; Pâ€‰=â€‰.00016), and small area emphasis (HR=â€‰0.62; Pâ€‰=â€‰.0013) from the EOB-MRI data. Radiomic CT features were not prognostic. The prognostic index strongly stratified high- and low-risk prognostic groups (HRâ€‰=â€‰0.31; Pâ€‰=â€‰.00068).


CONCLUSION
Radiomic MRI features provided meaningful prognostic information above clinical covariates alone. This merits further validation for potential clinical implementation to inform management.",2019,Journal of surgical oncology
Assessment of the cardiovascular adverse effects of drug-drug interactions through a combined analysis of spontaneous reports and predicted drug-target interactions,"Adverse drug effects (ADEs) are one of the leading causes of death in developed countries and are the main reason for drug recalls from the market, whereas the ADEs that are associated with action on the cardiovascular system are the most dangerous and widespread. The treatment of human diseases often requires the intake of several drugs, which can lead to undesirable drug-drug interactions (DDIs), thus causing an increase in the frequency and severity of ADEs. An evaluation of DDI-induced ADEs is a nontrivial task and requires numerous experimental and clinical studies. Therefore, we developed a computational approach to assess the cardiovascular ADEs of DDIs. This approach is based on the combined analysis of spontaneous reports (SRs) and predicted drug-target interactions to estimate the five cardiovascular ADEs that are induced by DDIs, namely, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, ventricular tachycardia, cardiac failure, and arterial hypertension. We applied a method based on least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression to SRs for the identification of interacting pairs of drugs causing corresponding ADEs, as well as noninteracting pairs of drugs. As a result, five datasets containing, on average, 3100 potentially ADE-causing and non-ADE-causing drug pairs were created. The obtained data, along with information on the interaction of drugs with 1553 human targets predicted by PASS Targets software, were used to create five classification models using the Random Forest method. The average area under the ROC curve of the obtained models, sensitivity, specificity and balanced accuracy were 0.837, 0.764, 0.754 and 0.759, respectively. The predicted drug targets were also used to hypothesize the potential mechanisms of DDI-induced ventricular tachycardia for the top-scoring drug pairs. The created five classification models can be used for the identification of drug combinations that are potentially the most or least dangerous for the cardiovascular system.",2019,PLoS Computational Biology
[Analysis of the genetic factors controlling malarial infection in man].,"Genetic factors have clearly been shown to play a role in controlling malarial infection in animal models. There is now also increasing evidence for the genetic control of malaria in man. We carried out a segregation analysis based on blood parasite load phenotype for a population of the town of Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina-Faso). This analysis demonstrated a strong genetic effect. Our results were not consistent with the segregation of a major gene and thus suggest that parasite load is under the control of minor genes. The genetic effect was stronger in children than in adults. We carried out a regression analysis in children and found that there was an association between the phenotype for blood parasite load and the q31-33 region of chromosome 5. We identified a gene in this region, Pfil1 (Plasmodium falciparum infection levels 1), which accounted for almost 50% of the variance in blood parasite load and which played a fundamental role in the control of infection. The 5q31-33 region contains several genes encoding cytokines that regulate T lymphocytes. The identification of genes controlling malarial infection opens up new possibilities for preventive and treatment strategies. It should be possible in the near future to identify individuals at risk of malaria, who would derive the greatest benefit from preventive and therapeutic measures. Finally, a deeper understanding of these genes controlling protective immune responses could be of value for the development of vaccines.",1999,Sante
SNAP: A semismooth Newton algorithm for pathwise optimization with optimal local convergence rate and oracle properties,"We propose a semismooth Newton algorithm for pathwise optimization (SNAP) for the LASSO and Enet in sparse, high-dimensional linear regression. SNAP is derived from a suitable formulation of the KKT conditions based on Newton derivatives. It solves the semismooth KKT equations efficiently by actively and continuously seeking the support of the regression coefficients along the solution path with warm start. At each knot in the path, SNAP converges locally superlinearly for the Enet criterion and achieves an optimal local convergence rate for the LASSO criterion, i.e., SNAP converges in one step at the cost of two matrix-vector multiplication per iteration. Under certain regularity conditions on the design matrix and the minimum magnitude of the nonzero elements of the target regression coefficients, we show that SNAP hits a solution with the same signs as the regression coefficients and achieves a sharp estimation error bound in finite steps with high probability. The computational complexity of SNAP is shown to be the same as that of LARS and coordinate descent algorithms per iteration. Simulation studies and real data analysis support our theoretical results and demonstrate that SNAP is faster and accurate than LARS and coordinate descent algorithms.",2018,ArXiv
Four-Week Fluoxetine (SSRI) Exposure Diminishes Aggressive Behaviour of Male Siamese Fighting Fish (Betta splendens),"Aggression, especially territorial is a serious problem in farmed and ornamental fish. Especially the tropical species like Siamese fighting fish Betta splendens or marine species like blu head Thalassoma bifasciatum. Also farmed species of Salmoniformes (Coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch, rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss) exhibit territorial aggression which is correlated with growth rate of the fish. In these species native territorial aggression occurs, and in ethology it is called stereotypical agonistic behaviour or conspecific aggression. In this type modulation of aggression serotonin (5-HT) plays a main role. A decrease of 5-HT in brain intensifies these type of aggression and in opposite an increase of 5-HT reduces it. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of different doses of fluoxetine on male aggressive behaviors of Betta splendens fish. It was concluded that fluoxetine added to aquarium water in the doses of 4, 40 and/or 100 Î¼gÂ·gaâ€“1 BW during 14 - 28 days increased synaptic levels of 5-HT what in turn resulted in the reduction of the specific aggressive behaviors. Fluoxetine caused periodic, and sometimes even total weakening of male-male type fight, which is a standard trial applied in ethological research on Siamese fighting fish. In current study, the most effective was the dose of 40 Î¼gÂ·gâ€“1 BW. The mechanism of this antiaggressivity depended on an increase of serotonergic system activity in animal brain (especially, in raphe nuclei), however synaptic levels of 5-HT in brain were not measured in this experiment. Thus, the hypothesis that exposure from day 1 - 21 would reduce aggression was rejected; as was the hypothesis that exposure on fluoxetine from day 10 (16) - 14 - 28 would rapidly reduce aggression in teleost fishes. The results obtained suggests that a complex role of serotonin in the expression of aggression in teleost fish because acute treatment with 5-HT1A receptor agonist WAY-100635 did not increase aggression in fish [1]. We emphasize the physiological concepts that can be addressed with this experiment, including the role of the serotonergic system in regulation of aggression, and the interplay of environmental contaminants and physiology in regulating the expression of behavior of fishes.",2012,Journal of Behavioral and Brain Science
A Holistic Clustering Methodology for Liver Transplantation Survival,"Background Liver transplants account for a high number of procedures with major investments from all stakeholders involved; however, limited studies address liver transplant population heterogeneity pretransplant predictive of posttransplant survival. Objective The aim of the study was to identify novel and meaningful patient clusters predictive of mortality that explains the heterogeneity of liver transplant population, taking a holistic approach. Methods A retrospective cohort study of 344 adult patients who underwent liver transplantation between 2008 through 2014. Predictors were summarized severity scores for comorbidities and other suboptimal health states grouped into 11 body systems, the primary reason for transplantation, demographics/environmental factors, and Model for End Liver Disease score. Logistic regression was used to compute the severity scores, hierarchical clustering with weighted Euclidean distance for clustering, Lasso-penalized regression for characterizing the clusters, and Kaplanâ€“Meier analysis to compare survival across the clusters. Results Cluster 1 included patients with more severe circulatory problems. Cluster 2 represented older patients with more severe primary disease, whereas Cluster 3 contained healthiest patients. Clusters 4 and 5 represented patients with musculoskeletal (e.g., pain) and endocrine problems (e.g., malnutrition), respectively. There was a statistically significant difference for mortality between clusters (p < .001). Conclusions This study developed a novel methodology to address heterogeneous and high-dimensional liver transplant population characteristics in a single study predictive of survival. A holistic approach for data modeling and additional psychosocial risk factors has the potential to address holistically nursing challenges on liver transplant care and research.",2018,Nursing Research
Robust change point detection method via adaptive LAD-LASSO,"Change point problem is one of the hot issues in statistics, econometrics, signal processing and so on. LAD estimator is more robust than OLS estimator, especially when datasets subject to heavy tailed errors or outliers. LASSO is a popular choice for shrinkage estimation. In the paper, we combine the two classical ideas together to put forward a robust detection method via adaptive LAD-LASSO to estimate change points in the mean-shift model. The basic idea is converting the change point estimation problem into variable selection problem with penalty. An enhanced two-step procedure is proposed. Simulation and a real example show that the novel method is really feasible and the fast and effective computation algorithm is easier to realize.",2017,Statistical Papers

Evaluating the Potential of Sentinel-2 for Low Severity Mites Infestation Detection in Grapes,"The Mite is one of the major sucking pests in grape which goes undetected in its initial phase as the symptoms are not easily visible to the naked eyes. In this paper, we address the problem of mites infestation detection using temporal hyperspectral data and also evaluate the potential of using Sentinel-2 data for mites infestation detection. The reflectance data from grape leaves with healthy and low infestations of mites have been collected using spectroradiometer. The hyperspectral remote sensing data is collected from 213 bands with wavelength ranging from 350 nm to 1052 nm during 15th Jan â€“ 18th Feb 2017. Variations observed in the spectral reflectance over time makes the detection based on multitemporal data difficult. Data in 213 narrow contiguous bands is used as feature set for hyperspectral data analysis but this large feature set may cause the over-fitting problem and also poses the requirement of large storage and greater processing time. To avoid this, feature selection using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) has been carried out to get the optimum band set. Features selected by LASSO were fed to classifiers such as Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Logistic Regression (LR) to evaluate their performance. Results suggest that LR based model provides maximum accuracy of 93.24%. In addition to this, to investigate the potential of using Sentinel-2, data in 213 narrow bands were simulated to Sentinel-2. Data has been simulated to 10 and 20m spatial resolution bands available in 350â€“1050nm range. This simulated 8 band feature set has been fed to the same set of classifiers to evaluate their performance. Results suggests that LR provides maximum classification accuracy of 89.12% using simulated Sentinel-2 bands. Further to validate the algorithm using actual ground observations from the field, we have implemented simulated Sentinel-2 based algorithm on two Sentinel-2 images available during the study period and results are compared with actual ground observations about mites infestation. Results suggest mites detection accuracy of 83.33% which shows the good agreement and potential of Sentinel-2 for mites infestation detection.",2018,IGARSS 2018 - 2018 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium
Sleep/wake classification using cardiorespiratory features extracted from photoplethysmogram,"Human sleep cyclically alternates between wakefulness and different sleep stages. There are various physiological changes that occur during wakefulness and sleep transitions. In particular, fluctuations occur in cardiorespiratory activity, mainly determined by the autonomic nervous system. The purpose of this study was to implement a multivariate logistic regression model to classify 30-second epochs of an overnight sleep dataset into awake and sleep states using the features extracted from the photoplethysmogram (PPG). The extracted features provided information about heart rate variability, respiratory activity, vascular tone and body movement. Overnight PPG signals were collected using a smartphone-based pulse oximeter, simultaneously with standard polysomnography from 160 children at the British Columbia Children's hospital. The sleep technician scored all wake/sleep epochs throughout the PSG study. We divided the dataset into training data, used to develop the model using LASSO, and test data, used to validate the model. The developed model was assessed epoch-by-epoch for each subject individually, andfor the complete test dataset. The performance of the model on the full test dataset showed a median accuracy of 77%, sensitivity of 80%, and specificity of 70%. Thus, providing a detailed epoch-by-epoch analysis with at-home pulse oximetry alone is feasible with accuracy, sensitivity and specificity values above 70%. However, the performance of the model might decrease when analyzing subjects with a high number epochs of wakefulness.",2016,2016 Computing in Cardiology Conference (CinC)
Selecting Spatial Scale of Area-Level Covariates in Regression Models,"SELECTING SPATIAL SCALE OF AREA-LEVEL COVARIATES IN REGRESSION MODELS By Lauren P. Grant, Ph.D. A dissertation submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at Virginia Commonwealth University. Virginia Commonwealth University, 2016 Director: David C. Wheeler, Ph.D., MPH Assistant Professor, Department of Biostatistics Director: Chris Gennings, Ph.D. Research Professor, Department of Preventive Medicine Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai In epidemiological and environmental studies, investigators are often interested in the contextual or area-level effects that are associated with a specific health outcome. Area-based covariates are typically available at multiple spatial scales (i.e., areal units or buffer distances). Studies have found that the level of association between an area-level covariate and an outcome can vary depending on the spatial scale (SS) of a particular covariate. However, covariates used in regression models are customarily modeled at the same spatial unit. In this dissertation, we developed four SS model selection algorithms that select the best spatial scale for each area-level covariate. The SS forward stepwise, SS incremental forward stagewise, SS least angle regression (LARS), and SS lasso algorithms allow for the selection of different area-level",2016,
Bednets and malaria.,"
 Studies across Africa have shown that insecticide-treated materials (ITMs) such as bednets can substantially reduce levels of child mortality through the prevention of malaria. However, while the results of efficacy trials may dictate the need to use ITMs, people in malaria-endemic areas may not recognize and comply with the need. If one wishes to get people to use health technology such as insecticide-impregnated bednets, one must learn about the end-users through clear, simple, formative research, identifying their habits, needs, and wants. Whichever strategy is employed to get ITMs to people in need, the end-users must be committed to obtaining them, caring for them, and using them. All populations in sub-Saharan Africa go to considerable lengths to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes, and see mosquitoes as nuisances rather than as the vectors of a potentially deadly disease. These populations therefore want bednets more to counter mosquitoes as a nuisance than for use as a health technology. In accordance with the population's desires, the authors in Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso, no longer stress the health benefits of using insecticide-impregnated bednets. They instead promote ITMs as devices capable of giving families peace from mosquitoes and their bites. To repel not only Anopheles gambiae, the vector of malaria-causing parasites, but also Culex, the main nuisance biter in the area, a higher dose of insecticide is now being used to ensure the broad-spectrum repulsion of mosquitoes by ITM users.

Variable selection for inhomogeneous spatial point process models,"In this work, we consider variable selection when modelling the intensity and clustering of inhomogeneous spatial point processes, integrating well-known procedures in the respective fields of variable selection and spatial point process modelling to introduce a simple procedure for variable selection in spatial point process modelling. Specifically, we consider modelling spatial point data with Poisson, pairwise interaction and Neymanâ€“Scott cluster models, and incorporate LASSO, adaptive LASSO, and elastic net regularization methods into the generalized linear model framework for fitting these point models. We perform simulation studies to explore the effectiveness of using each of the three-regularization methods in our procedure. We then use the procedure in two applications, modelling the intensity and clustering of rainforest trees with soil and geographical covariates using a Neymanâ€“Scott model, and of fast food restaurant locations in New York City with Census variables and school locations using a pairwise interaction model.

A GPS spoofing detection and classification correlator-based technique using the LASSO,"ï€  Abstractâ€”This work proposes a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) spoofing detection and classification technique for single antenna receivers. We formulate an optimization problem at the baseband correlator domain by using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO). We model correlator tap outputs of the received signal to form a dictionary of triangleshaped functions and leverage sparse signal processing to choose a decomposition of shifted matching triangles from said dictionary. The optimal solution of this minimization problem discriminates the presence of a potential spoofing attack peak by observing a decomposition of two different code-phase values (authentic and spoofed) in a sparse vector output. We use a threshold to mitigate false alarms. Furthermore, we present a variation of the minimization problem by enhancing the dictionary to a higherresolution of shifted triangles. The proposed technique can be implemented as an advanced fine-acquisition monitoring tool to aid in the tracking loops for spoofing mitigation. In our experiments, we are able to distinguish authentic and spoofer peaks from synthetic data simulations and from a real dataset, namely, the Texas Spoofing Test Battery (TEXBAT). The proposed method achieves 0.3% detection error rate (DER) for a spoofer attack in nominal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions for an authentic-over-spoofer power of 3 dB.",2020,ArXiv
"Sulfur variability and element geochemistry of the No. 11 coal seam from the Antaibao mining district, China","Abstract The roof, bottom and 24 coal ply samples were collected by finely partitioning No. 11 coal seam from Antaibao mining district, Shanxi, China in terms of lithotypes. Proximate and sulfur analyses, ICP-AES, ICP-MS, AFS, XRD, SEMâ€“EDX techniques were used on these samples, in order to investigate the vertical variability and origin of sulfur and also the geochemistry of major and trace elements in the seam. The weighted mean content of total sulfur of the 24 coal plies is 2.4Â wt%, belonging to the medium-sulfur coal, but there are great differences in the contents of total sulfur and forms of sulfur between the 24 plies: total sulfur content >3.0Â wt% for 5 plies, organic sulfur content >1.0Â wt% for 13 plies and pyritic sulfur content >2.0Â wt% for 4 plies. It is found that the differences were mainly caused by the degree of marine influences and the contents of clay minerals as well as the organic matter. The ply 21 has an abnormal high content of inorganic sulfur (pyritic sulfur 9.45Â wt% and sulfate sulfur 5.97Â wt%). This was caused by the presence of bauxite minerals-bearing kaolinite in the underlying ply 22 blocking the further infiltration of sulfate from the overlying plies during the deposition. The seam is dominated in kaolinite and, to a lesser extent, in pyrite, and there also exist minor amounts of szomolnokite, diaspore, boehmite, calcite, siderite, dolomite, magnesite, feldspar, gypsum. Szomolnokite and gypsum possibly resulted from the oxidation of pyrite. The seam is greatly characterized by finely-grained pyrite concentrating in cutinite. Hazardous trace elements Hg, Pb and As are mainly concentrated in pyrite, so that they can be partially removed by physical coal cleaning with an aim of removal of sulfur, while thalassophile elements Br,Â Ca,Â Cl,Â Mg and Sr, are clearly associated with the organic sulfur, reflecting that their contents can be decreased by coal blending means due to a partial organic affinity.",2007,Fuel
Promising key genes associated with tumor microenvironments and prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma,"Abstract Background Despite significant advances in multimodality treatments, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains one of the common malignant tumors. Tumor microenvironments play an important role in progress of HCC. The study aimed to identify potential key genes associated with tumor microenvironments and prognosis of HCC. Methods The infiltration level of immune cells and stromal cells were calculated and quantified based on the ESTIMATE algorithm. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between high and low groups according to immune or stromal scores were screened using the gene expression profile of HCC pateitns in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and were further linked to prognosis of HCC. These genes were validated in four independent HCC cohorts. Survival-related key genes were identified by LASSO Cox regression model. Results HCC patients with high immune/stromal score had better survival benefits than patients with low score. A total of 899 DEGs were identified and involved in immune responses and extracellular matrices, 147 of which were associated with overall survival. Subsequently, 52 of 147 survival-related DEGs were valided in additional cohorts. Finally, 10â€‰key genes were selected (STSL2, TMC5, DOK5, RASGRP2, NLRC3, KLRB1, CD5L, CFHR3, ADH1C and UGT2B15) and used to construct a prognostic gene signature, presenting good performance in predicting overall survival. Conclusions This study extracted a list of genes associated with tumor microenvironments and the prognosis of HCC and would provide several valuable directions for the prognostic prediction and molecular targeted therapy of HCC in the future.

Learning Microbial Interaction Networks from Metagenomic Count Data,"Many microbes associate with higher eukaryotes and impact their vitality. To engineer microbiomes for host benefit, we must understand the rules of community assembly and maintenance that, in large part, demand an understanding of the direct interactions among community members. Toward this end, we have developed a Poisson-multivariate normal hierarchical model to learn direct interactions from the count-based output of standard metagenomics sequencing experiments. Our model controls for confounding predictors at the Poisson layer and captures direct taxon-taxon interactions at the multivariate normal layer using an â„“1 penalized precision matrix. We show in a synthetic experiment that our method handily outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as SparCC and the graphical lasso (glasso). In a real in planta perturbation experiment of a nine-member bacterial community, we show our model, but not SparCC or glasso, correctly resolves a direct interaction structure among three community members that associates with Arabidopsis thaliana roots. We conclude that our method provides a structured, accurate, and distributionally reasonable way of modeling correlated count-based random variables and capturing direct interactions among them.",2016,Journal of computational biology : a journal of computational molecular cell biology
Chronology andKey Steps in Plastid Evolution : From the Archaeplastidal Ancestor of Plastids to Plastid Diversification in Seed Plants,"Key steps in evolution are often singularities. The emergence of land plants is one such case and it is not immediately apparent why. A recent analysis found that the zygnematophycean algae represent the closest relative to embryophytes. Intriguingly, many exaptations thought essential to conquer land are common among various streptophytes, but zygnematophycean algae share with land plants the transfer of a few plastid genes to the nucleus. Considering the contribution of the chloroplast to terrestrialization highlights potentially novel exaptations that currently remain unexplored. We discuss how the streptophyte chloroplast evolved into what we refer to as the embryoplast, and argue this was as important for terrestrialization by freshwater algae as the host cellassociated exaptations that are usually focused upon.",2016,
Molecular Characteristics and Pathogenicity of a Novel Transplacental Rat Cytomegalovirus,"Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a species-specific betaherpesvirus which causes acute, 
persistent and latent infections in both humans and animals. CMV is the most frequent 
congenital infection in humans. RCMV strain ALL-03 was the first CMV ever isolated 
from the placenta and uterus of the house rat (Rattus rattus diardii). As such, 
hypothetically, this RCMV should be a distinct strain from the existing isolates that is 
capable to cross placenta and infect the fetus. The objectives of the study were (i) to 
identify the novelty of the RCMV strain ALL-03, (ii) to characterize its immediateearly 
(IE) genes, and (iii) to determine its pathogenicity by developing the in utero 
transmission and neonatal infection models in rats. Overall, the present study signifies 
the virological and molecular detection of the RCMV antigen, DNA and mRNA in 
addition to the serological demonstration of the RCMV-specific immune response. 
Other than the traditional diagnostic methods, the study had also used advanced 
techniques, for examples, double antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
iv 
assay (DAS-ELISA), quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain 
reaction (RT-PCR) and real-time PCR. The study was commenced by characterizing the 
strain ALL-03. Upon infection, the virus showed delayed cytopathology, cellassociation, 
low maximum titres, the presence of herpesviral inclusion bodies and 
herpesvirus related particles in infected rat embryonic fibroblast (REF) cells; specific 
antigen-antibody reaction with RCMV strain Maastricht; and rat-specific are all in 
accord with a RCMV. The genetic difference at the genome level with that of 
Maastricht, English, UPM/Sg and UPM/Kn strains had confirmed its novelty. The first 
recognized genes expressed during CMV infection, the IE genes were studied by 
analyzing the mRNA transcripts of infected-REF cells. The cDNA libraries were cloned 
into plasmids for sequencing. Each sequence was then probed towards the databanks for 
an identity search. Following the PCR and hybridization techniques, two distinct 
transcripts of unknown identities within the databanks were confirmed to be of the 
strain ALL-03 origin. These two IE transcripts were found considerably different to the 
IE genes of RCMV strains Maastricht and English. Meanwhile, a real-time RT-PCR 
assay was developed specifically to quantify the in vitro transcription levels of the two 
RCMV IE mRNAs. The kinetic transcription profiles and the bioinformatics analyses 
suggested them as exon 4 or IE1 and exon 5 or IE2. An in utero infection model 
demonstrated the clinical signs, pathological changes and anatomical virus distribution 
to the uterus, placenta, embryo, fetus, lung, kidney, spleen, liver and salivary gland of 
rats. The placenta was observed to be involved in the maternofetal RCMV infection. 
The maternal viremia leading to uterine infection which subsequently transmitting to 
the fetus through the placenta is the most likely phenomenon of congenital CMV 
v 
infection in the model. The study has established a useful rat model that mimics the 
neonatal CMV infection in humans especially for the virus dissemination in different 
organs, viremia and immune response. The kinetic quantitation of the viral antigen, 
DNA and antibody was assessed by DAS-ELISA, real-time PCR and ELISA 
respectively. This neonatal rat model demonstrated a characteristic splenomegaly and 
acute virus dissemination in blood, spleen, liver, lung and kidney. The salivary gland 
infection is suggested to augment the antibody response that may be responsible for a 
reduction of viremia. The study has provided important new insights of CMV disease 
particularly for a congenital infection in humans. The exploitation of the major IE 
regions has permitted greatest advances as a candidate of viral-vectored 
immunocontraception for rat control and generation of eukaryotic expression vectors.",2005,
Model Selection and Estimation in Generalized Additive Models and Generalized Additive Mixed Models.,"WANG, DONG. Model Selection and Estimation in Generalized Additive Models and Generalized Additive Mixed Models. (Under the direction of Dr. Daowen Zhang.) In this dissertation, we propose a method of model selection and estimation in generalized additive models (GAMs) for data from a distribution in the exponential family. The linear mixed model representation of the smoothing spline estimators of the nonparametric functions is constructed, where the inverse of the smoothing parameters are treated as extra variance components and the importance of these nonparametric functions is controlled by the induced variance components. By maximizing the penalized quasi-likelihood with the adaptive LASSO, we could effectively select the important nonparametric functions. Approximate EM algorithms are applied to achieve the goal of model selection and estimation. In addition, we also calculate the approximate pointwise frequentist and Bayesian confidence intervals for selected functions. The eigenvalueeigenvector decomposition approach is used to approximate the induced random effects from the nonparametric functions in order to reduce the dimensions of matrices and speed up the computation. In the case of longitudinal data, we apply the generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) to model the relationship. The subject-specific random effects are introduced to accommodate the correlation among the responses. Similarly, we propose the adaptive LASSO for generalized additive mixed models to perform model selection and estimation. To evaluate the method, we investigate simulation studies and provide real data applications. c âƒ Copyright 2013 by Dong Wang All Rights Reserved Model Selection and Estimation in Generalized Additive Models and Generalized Additive Mixed Models",2012,
Severity of Bulimia Nervosa,"Aims: In order to identify the most important components of the severity of bulimia nervosa (as well as identifying clinical cases), we explored the relation between dimensional and categorical assessment. This was achieved by studying the performance of variables from standard instruments (measuring specific and general psychopathology) in predicting an expert rating of overall syndrome severity. Method: In total, 213 cases were selected (across the whole range of severity). We applied regression with optimal scaling to model nonlinear relations in the data, and the lasso method with bootstrapping for predictor selection. The best model contained 2 scales of the Eating Disorders Inventory (â€˜bulimiaâ€™ and â€˜drive for thinnessâ€™) and the frequency of the binges. The sensitivity and specificity of case classification using the obtained model was determined. Results: The model can predict the probability of being a clinical case at a rate of 88%. The presented statistical methods are innovative and promising approaches that can help researchers and clinicians to better define sets of variables for treatment evaluation and outcome studies. Conclusion: The results indicate that severity and outcome in bulimia nervosa should be determined by measuring both cognitive and behavioral aspects of the symptoms.",2008,Psychopathology
DNA Methylation and All-Cause Mortality in Middle-Aged and Elderly Danish Twins,"Several studies have linked DNA methylation at individual CpG sites to aging and various diseases. Recent studies have also identified single CpGs whose methylation levels are associated with all-cause mortality. In this study, we perform an epigenome-wide study of the association between CpG methylation and mortality in a population of 435 monozygotic twin pairs from three Danish twin studies. The participants were aged 55-90 at the time of blood sampling and were followed for up to 20 years. We validated our results by comparison with results from a British and a Swedish cohort, as well as results from the literature. We identified 2806 CpG sites associated with mortality (false discovery rate ( FDR ) < 0.05 ), of which 24 had an association p-value below 10 - 7 . This was confirmed by intra-pair comparison controlling for confounding effects. Eight of the 24 top sites could be validated in independent datasets or confirmed by previous studies. For all these eight sites, hypomethylation was associated with poor survival prognosis, and seven showed monozygotic correlations above 35%, indicating a potential moderate to strong heritability, but leaving room for substantial shared or unique environmental effects. We also set up a predictor for mortality using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. The predictor showed good performance on the Danish data under cross-validation, but did not perform very well in independent samples.",2018,Genes
On the use of multi-step cost functions for generating forecasts,"Accurate forecasts are of principal importance for operations. Exponential smoothing is widely used due to its simplicity, relatively good forecast accuracy, ease of implementation and automation. The literature has continuously improved upon many of its initial limitations, yet novel applications of exponential smoothing have brought new forecasting challenges that have revealed additional pitfalls in its use. In this work, we examine potential reasons for these issues and argue that special attention should be drawn to the cost function used to estimate model parameters. Conventional cost functions assume that the postulated model is an accurate reflection of underlying demand, which is not the case for the majority of real applications. We propose the use of alternative cost functions based on multi-step ahead predictions and trace forecasts. We show that these are univariate shrinkage estimators. We describe the nature of shrinkage and show that it differs from established shrinkage approaches, such as ridge and LASSO regression, offering new modelling capabilities. Using retailing sales, we construct forecasts and empirically demonstrate this shrinkage, validate our theoretical understanding, and provide evidence of both economic and forecast accuracy gains. We discuss implications for practice and limitations of the shrinkage caused by the multi-step cost functions.",2018,
"Penalized regression, standard errors, and Bayesian lassos","Penalized regression methods for simultaneous variable selection and coe-cient estimation, especially those based on the lasso of Tibshirani (1996), have received a great deal of attention in recent years, mostly through frequen- tist models. Properties such as consistency have been studied, and are achieved by difierent lasso variations. Here we look at a fully Bayesian formulation of the problem, which is âˆžexible enough to encompass most versions of the lasso that have been previously considered. The advantages of the hierarchical Bayesian for- mulations are many. In addition to the usual ease-of-interpretation of hierarchical models, the Bayesian formulation produces valid standard errors (which can be problematic for the frequentist lasso), and is based on a geometrically ergodic Markov chain. We compare the performance of the Bayesian lassos to their fre- quentist counterparts using simulations, data sets that previous lasso papers have used, and a di-cult modeling problem for predicting the collapse of governments around the world. In terms of prediction mean squared error, the Bayesian lasso performance is similar to and, in some cases, better than, the frequentist lasso.",2010,Bayesian Analysis
Variable Selection for Regression Models with Missing Data.,"We consider the variable selection problem for a class of statistical models with missing data, including missing covariate and/or response data. We investigate the smoothly clipped absolute deviation penalty (SCAD) and adaptive LASSO and propose a unified model selection and estimation procedure for use in the presence of missing data. We develop a computationally attractive algorithm for simultaneously optimizing the penalized likelihood function and estimating the penalty parameters. Particularly, we propose to use a model selection criterion, called the IC(Q) statistic, for selecting the penalty parameters. We show that the variable selection procedure based on IC(Q) automatically and consistently selects the important covariates and leads to efficient estimates with oracle properties. The methodology is very general and can be applied to numerous situations involving missing data, from covariates missing at random in arbitrary regression models to nonignorably missing longitudinal responses and/or covariates. Simulations are given to demonstrate the methodology and examine the finite sample performance of the variable selection procedures. Melanoma data from a cancer clinical trial is presented to illustrate the proposed methodology.",2010,Statistica Sinica

"[Positive impact on the Expanded Program on Immunization when sending call-back SMS through a Computerized Immunization Register, Bobo Dioulasso (Burkina Faso)].","The impact of a Computerized Immunization Register (CIR) on Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI), with sending SMS to parents before immunization sessions, has never been studied in sub-Saharan Africa. The objective of this study is to measure EPI quickness and completeness of vaccinations after sending call-back SMS to parents through CIR put in place in a health center. In a health center, chosen at random (Colma 1) in the city of Bobo Dioulasso, Burkina Faso, West Africa, mothers, at first EPI session, if they had a mobile phone available at hand or in her surrounding, were randomized for receiving, or not, a call-back SMS before following EPI sessions, after child registration on a Francophone CIR (Siloxane's Intervax Â©). Mothers, which were sent SMS and did not correctly followed sessions were asked through mobile phone why their child was late for EPI. 523 newborns were included in the study, with 253 whose parents were sent SMS, and 268 being informed of sessions only by ordinary methods. At second EPI session at 2 months of age, there was a statistical significant increase of coverage for children whose parents received SMS (p<0.001). Quickness to come also to this session was significantly shorter when parents received SMS (p=0.03). At third EPI session at 3 months of age, attendance to EPI for children whose parents were sent SMS was significantly better (p<0.001). Quickness to come to this session was shorter for children with SMS (p=0.02). At fourth EPI session at 4 months of age, attendance for children with SMS was significantly better for children whose parents were sent SMS (p<0.001). Quickness to come to this session was better but not significantly different (p=0.49). Out of 101 children registered as late for EPI sessions in Colma 1 CIR, even with call-back SMS, 19 (19%) parents could not be reached on the telephone. 31/82 (38%) mothers had shifted for EPI to a more proximate vaccination center (Colma 2), and 5 (6%) to private or civil servants clinic. 14/82 (17%) mothers had been travelling far from health center. Ten (12%) admitted neglect of EPI sessions. Two (2%) children had deceased, and one mother did not come back to Colma 1 after her child's AEFI. One child has been dismissed two times of vaccination following recommendation not to open a measles multi-dose vial for a single child, and did not come back. Of 523 children registered in CIR, 77 (14.7%) could not be found in the paper registers of Colma 1. Quickness and completeness for EPI is increased by sending SMS with help of CIR. An official number should be given for each child registered in CIR, consulted by health staff admitting children in urgency, allowing EPI vaccinations completion. With CIR safeguards, CIR should replace paper registers and should be used to send EPI reports by internet at central levels, helping MOH coverage determination and MAPI surveillance. The fall of coverage due to restriction policy not to open a multidose vial for a single child is low. Health staff should institute telephone call-back for badly immunized children registered on CIR and incorporate in it, with SMS call-back, pregnant women, to better complete prenatal sessions and tetanus vaccination.",2015,Bulletin de la Societe de pathologie exotique
An Examination of the Relationship Between the Temporal and Spatial Organization of a Student's Handwritten Statics Solution and Its Correctness,"Author(s): Van Arsdale, Timothy | Advisor(s): Stahovich, Thomas | Abstract: The purpose of this project is to understand how the organization of a student's solution to a problem relates to the correctness of that work. Understanding this relationship will enable software to provide early warnings and targeted feedback to students who are struggling in a course. In this study, students in an undergraduate statics course completed their work, including homework, quizzes, and exams, using LivescribeTM Smartpens. These devices record the handwritten solutions as time-stamped pen strokes, enabling the examination of not only the final ink on the page, but also the order in which it was written. This unique database of student work was used to examine how the history of the solution construction process correlates with the correctness of the work. Solution histories were characterized by a number of quantitative features describing the temporal and spatial organization of the work. For example, some features describe the order in which various problem-solving activities, such as the construction of free body diagrams and equilibrium equations, are performed and others describe the amount of time spent on each activity. The spatial organization of the work is characterized by the extent to which a student revisits earlier parts of a solution to revise his/her work. Cross-validated regression models were constructed using the relaxed lasso method to determine the correlation between these features and student performance. On average, the models explained 43% of the variance in performance. This is a surprising result in that the features do not actually consider the semantic content of the writing. The relaxed lasso method also identified which features were most predictive of problem correctness, thus giving insights into which student behaviors are indicative of high or low performance. For example, revising work long after it was written indicates low performance. While our work has focused on engineering statics, we expect that these techniques will generalize to other domains for which problem solutions include both diagrams and equations.",2012,
Pooling optimal combinations of energy thresholds in spectroscopic CT,"Photon counting detectors used in spectroscopic CT are often based on small pixels and therefore offer only limited space to include energy discriminators and their associated counters in each pixel cell. For this reason, it is important to make efficient use of the available energy discriminators in order to achieve an optimized material contrast at a radiation dose as low as possible. Unfortunately, the complexity of evaluating every possible combination of energy thresholds, given a fixed number of counters, rapidly increases with the resolution at which this search is performed, and makes brute-force approaches to this problem infeasible. In this work, we introduce methods from machine learning, in particular sparse regression, to perform a feature selection to determine optimal combinations of energy thresholds. We will demonstrate how methods enforcing row-sparsity on a linear regressionâ€™s coefficient matrix can be applied to the multiple response problem in spectroscopic CT, i.e. the case in which a single set of energy thresholds is sought to simultaneously retrieve concentrations pertaining to a multitude of materials in an optimal way. These methods are applied to CT images experimentally obtained with a Medipix3RX detector operated in charge summing mode and with a CdTe sensor at a pixel pitch of 110Î¼m. We show that the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso), generalized to the multiple response case, chooses four out of 20 possible threshold positions that allow discriminating PMMA, iodine and gadolinium in a contrast agent phantom at a higher accuracy than with equally spaced thresholds. Finally, we illustrate why it might be unwise to use a higher number of energy thresholds than absolutely necessary.",2014,
Penalized expectile regression: an alternative to penalized quantile regression,"This paper concerns the study of the entire conditional distribution of a response given predictors in a heterogeneous regression setting. A common approach to address heterogeneous data is quantile regression, which utilizes the minimization of the $$L_1$$L1 norm. As an alternative to quantile regression, we consider expectile regression, which relies on the minimization of the asymmetric $$L_2$$L2 norm and detects heteroscedasticity effectively. We assume that only a small set of predictors is relevant to the response and develop penalized expectile regression with SCAD and adaptive LASSO penalties. With properly chosen tuning parameters, we show that the proposed estimators display oracle properties. A numerical study using simulated and real examples demonstrates the competitive performance of the proposed penalized expectile regression, and its combined use with penalized quantile regression would be helpful and recommended for practitioners.",2019,Annals of the Institute of Statistical Mathematics
Food and Bioprt?ducts Processing sChemE,"Searching for the ways to process waste has become very topical today. Biotechnology is one of the most environments!ly attractive methods, which has the ability to solve the problem of waste utilization and to produce the valuable microbial products, for example biosurfactants.

HLA system and therapy of psoriasis.,"In 192 patients with psoriasis an increased frequency of the antigens HLA-B13 (19.79%, X2 = 32.79, p less than 0.001), HLA-B17 (24.47%, X2 = 64,84, p less than 0.001), and HLA-B27 (19.27%, X2 = 11.07, p less than 0.001) in comparison with the control group of 1,085 clinically healthy persons, was established. After 4 weeks of thalassotherapy 3 groups of patients could be distinguished: (1) those with full clinical remission - 50 (26.8%), (2) those with great or moderate improvement - 116 (60.4%), and (3) those with no improvement - 26 patients (13.6%). In the first two groups there is a statistically significant association with the HLA antigens B13 and B17. In the third group (no improvement) there is no such association with HLA-B13 (p less than 0.01). Consequently, patients in whom psoriasis is associated with HLA-B13 were better influenced by the thalassotherapy. The variability in the therapeutic efficiency means that perhaps there is a genetic heterogenicity in the group of common psoriasis.",1983,Dermatologica

Screening and Identification of Potential Prognostic Biomarkers in Adrenocortical Carcinoma,"Objective: Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare but aggressive malignant cancer that has been attracting growing attention over recent decades. This study aims to integrate protein interaction networks with gene expression profiles to identify potential biomarkers with prognostic value in silico. Methods: Three microarray data sets were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) according to the normalization annotation information. Enrichment analyses were utilized to describe biological functions. A protein-protein interaction network (PPI) of the DEGs was developed, and the modules were analyzed using STRING and Cytoscape. LASSO Cox regression was used to identify independent prognostic factors. The Kaplan-Meier method for the integrated expression score was applied to analyze survival outcomes. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed with area under curve (AUC) analysis to determine the diagnostic ability of the candidate biomarkers. Results: A total of 150 DEGs and 24 significant hub genes with functional enrichment were identified as candidate prognostic biomarkers. LASSO Cox regression suggested that ZWINT, PRC1, CDKN3, CDK1 and CCNA2 were independent prognostic factors in ACC. In multivariate Cox analysis, the integrated expression scores of the modules showed statistical significance in predicting disease-free survival (DFS, P = 0.019) and overall survival (OS, P < 0.001). Meanwhile, ROC curves were generated to validate the ability of the Cox model to predict prognosis. The AUC index for the integrated genes scores was 0.861 (P < 0.0001). Conclusion: In conclusion, the present study identifies DEGs and hub genes that may be involved in poor prognosis and early recurrence of ACC. The expression levels of ZWINT, PRC1, CDKN3, CDK1 and CCNA2 are of high prognostic value, and may help us understand better the underlying carcinogenesis or progression of ACC. Further studies are required to elucidate molecular pathogenesis and alteration in signaling pathways for these genes in ACC.",2019,Frontiers in Genetics
Speech bottleneck feature extraction method based on overlapping group lasso sparse deep neural network,"Abstract In this paper, a novel speech bottleneck feature extraction method based on overlapping group lasso sparse deep neural network is proposed. This method extracts the speech bottleneck features which contain supervised class information and adjacent voice frames related information by changing the architecture of deep neural network (DNN), to improve of the performance speech recognition. Firstly, in order to construct the sparse deep neural network, the sparse regularization of the overlapping group lasso algorithm is added to the single DNN object function which is regarded as the penalty item. Second, the speech bottleneck features can be extracted from the bottleneck layer of the sparse bottleneck DNN (BN-DNN). Finally, the speech bottleneck features are used as the input features of the deep neural network-hidden Markov model (DNN-HMM) speech recognition system. The large vocabulary continuous speech recognition experiment results on the Switchboard database indicate that the algorithm proposed in this paper can extract the speech bottleneck features with priori information, and reduce the word error rate in continuous speech recognition.",2018,Speech Commun.
Graphical Models Concepts in Compressed Sensing,"This paper surveys recent work in applying ideas from graphical models and message passing algorithms to solve large scale regularized regression problems. In particular, the focus is on compressed sensing reconstruction via ell_1 penalized least-squares (known as LASSO or BPDN). We discuss how to derive fast approximate message passing algorithms to solve this problem. Surprisingly, the analysis of such algorithms allows to prove exact high-dimensional limit results for the LASSO risk.

Reconstruction of a chronically ruptured Achilles tendon using an internal brace: a case report,"BackgroundWe reconstructed a chronically ruptured Achilles tendon and the associated scar tissue using braided polyblend polyethylene sutures (FiberWire; Arthrex Inc.; Naples, FL, USA) and anchors.Case presentationA 68-year-old Japanese man, who was being treated for right Achilles tendinosis, felt pain in his Achilles tendon when walking and started to find plantar flexion of his ankle joint difficult. As his symptoms persisted, he visited us after 4 weeks. Surgery and orthotic therapy were recommended, but he did not want to undergo these treatments. However, he began to find walking difficult and so underwent surgery 6 months after suffering the injury. The interior of the tendon was curetted, and the ruptured region was subjected to plication using the surrounding scar tissue. Using the percutaneous Achilles repair system (Arthrex Inc.), FiberWire sutures were inserted, and two skin incisions were made on the medial and lateral sides of his calcaneus in the region surrounding the Achilles tendon attachment. SutureLasso (Arthrex Inc.) was passed through, and the proximal FiberWire suture was relayed and fixed with 4.75-mm SwiveLock (Arthrex Inc.). After surgery, his foot was fixed in plaster at 20Â° plantar flexion of his ankle joint. The plaster was removed 1 week after surgery, and after-treatment was initiated with active dorsiflexion training. No orthosis was used after surgery. As of 16 postoperative months, no re-rupture had occurred.ConclusionsThis method might allow post-treatment rehabilitation, and so on, to occur earlier, and, hence, could become an option for the reconstruction of chronically ruptured Achilles tendons.",2018,Journal of Medical Case Reports
Block HSIC Lasso: model-free biomarker detection for ultra-high dimensional data,"MOTIVATION
Finding non-linear relationships between biomolecules and a biological outcome is computationally expensive and statistically challenging. Existing methods have important drawbacks, including among others lack of parsimony, non-convexity and computational overhead. Here we propose block HSIC Lasso, a non-linear feature selector that does not present the previous drawbacks.


RESULTS
We compare block HSIC Lasso to other state-of-the-art feature selection techniques in both synthetic and real data, including experiments over three common types of genomic data: gene-expression microarrays, single-cell RNA sequencing and genome-wide association studies. In all cases, we observe that features selected by block HSIC Lasso retain more information about the underlying biology than those selected by other techniques. As a proof of concept, we applied block HSIC Lasso to a single-cell RNA sequencing experiment on mouse hippocampus. We discovered that many genes linked in the past to brain development and function are involved in the biological differences between the types of neurons.


AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION
Block HSIC Lasso is implemented in the Python 2/3 package pyHSICLasso, available on PyPI. Source code is available on GitHub (https://github.com/riken-aip/pyHSICLasso).

"Nail in the Coffin Elie Ayache : From the Hume-event to the 1987-event , through","rom the first part, we recall that the thought of the absolute is needed if thought is to regain its speculative capability, and yet speculative metaphysics has to be rejected because the absolute shouldnâ€™t repose on an absolute necessary being. In this respect, the young French philosopher Quentin Meillassoux seems to offer us the best of both worlds.1 According to him, thought can regain its speculative capacity; it can reach outside the circle of what is given to thought, that is to say, it can reach outside itself in order to establish contact with beings that have preceded it; it can reach behind the phenomena to the very place where it was decided that the world â€œphenomenalizesâ€ this way and not in another way and that it â€œfeelsâ€ this way to be thinking and not another way, but where all of this could have been decided differently; yet this reach is not really pointed because the absolute it is reaching for, independent as it may be of the co-relational circle,2 is nothing other than the re-circling of the co-relational circle. Not its re-circling for the sake of re-expressing its essential finitude and limitation (as if the limitation of thought were to become the absolute), but of expressing its absolute contingency. It is a fact, not a necessity, that the co-relational circle should be what it is. brand of speculative thought, yet it remains to explain how the world and the laws of nature are so stable (Humeâ€™s problem). How can we safely expect that the balls on the billiard table will not suddenly display erratic behavior due to a sudden change of the laws of dynamics, that the stars and planets in the heavens will not suddenly change their course due to a sudden change in gravitational law, etc.? Both Hume and Kant, of whom Meillassoux says that they never doubted the intrinsic necessity of laws and of the uniformity of the physical world,3 as well as the opposite camp of rationalist philosophers, have traditionally relied on a probabilistic, or frequentist, argument in order to ground the necessity of laws. The idea is that if this were not case and if the physical laws were contingent, then, given the infinitely many things that keep happening to the world, sooner or later our laws would fail",2008,
Riposte vaccinale et persistance d'un risque Ã©pidÃ©mique de fiÃ¨vre jaune dans la rÃ©gion de Gaoua au sud-ouest du Burkina Faso : intÃ©rÃªt d'une Ã©quipe pluridisciplinaire,"Le 8 octobre 1999, un cas de fievre jaune en provenance du sud-ouest du Burkina Faso est identifie par le laboratoire de virologie du centre Muraz a Bobo Dioulasso. Cette zone est consideree comme a risque intermediaire pour la fievre jaune. Les vecteurs potentiels Aedes sont presents. Le risque d'epidemisation est craint du fait des mouvements importants de population suite aux troubles observes en Cote d'Ivoire. Le 23 octobre, la direction regionale de la Sante de Gaoua vaccine 1 000 personnes, soit 70 % de la population theorique autour du village du cas et demande une investigation dans la zone. Objectifs : une equipe pluridisciplinaire (epidemio-entomo-virologique) est formee afin de repondre aux points suivants : 1) etudier l'origine du cas et deceler la presence d'autres cas ou de formes frustes ; 2) evaluer la persistance d'un risque epidemique ; 3) tester la fiabilite de la methode de dosage des IgM sur confettis ; 4) apprecier l'interet d'une equipe pluridisciplinaire d'investigation suite a un cas confirme de fievre jaune. Methode : l'etude sur place comprend l'analyse spatio-temporelle du cas, la recherche de cas frustes ou passes inapercus et de sujets n'ayant pas ete vaccines, completee d'une etude serologique par dosage des IgM (prelevement sanguin classique et sur confettis), des prospections entomologiques visant a determiner la presence des vecteurs potentiels. Resultats : l'anamnese du cas est en faveur d'une contamination locale. Deux cas possibles, gueris, ont eu lieu au domicile du malade. Cent dix personnes saines de l'entourage ont echappe a la vaccination. Parmi ces dernieres, 58 dont 26 enfants, ont ete prelevees. Quatre (15,3 %) prelevements sont positifs chez des moins de 18 ans, aucun chez les adultes, temoignant de formes passees inapercues et de l'absence de protection immunitaire des jeunes dans le village, realisant une micro-epidemie. Une concordance de 100 % est trouvee entre l'analyse des prelevements sanguins classiques et les confettis. Ae. luteocephalus, vecteur potentiel selvatique, a ete capture a de faibles densites sur des sujets humains dans le village mais aucun autre vecteur potentiel n'a ete retrouve, notamment les vecteurs domestiques (Ae. aegypti, Ae. vittatus). Conclusion : l'intervention d'une equipe pluridisciplinaire a permis de preciser la persistance d'un risque epidemique, avec une seroconversion chez les sujets jeunes, malgre une reponse vaccinale rapide, faussement rassurante. L'emergence successive de cas sporadiques dans le sud-ouest du Burkina Faso impose une surveillance accrue de la fievre jaune afin de limiter le risque d'epidemie majore par les actuels mouvements de population. Le prelevement sanguin par confettis pour le dosage des IgM pourrait faciliter la surveillance et devrait etre confirme lors d'investigations futures.",2002,
Nuclear management in manual small incision cataract surgery by snare technique,"Manual small incision cataract surgery has evolved into a popular method of cataract surgery in India. However, in supra hard cataract, bringing out the whole nucleus through the sclerocorneal flap valve incision becomes difficult. A bigger incision required in such cataracts loses its value action, as the internal incision and corneal valve slips beyond the limbus into sclera. Struggling with the supra hard cataracts through a regular small incision. Phacofracture in the anterior chamber becomes a useful option in these cases. In the snare technique, a stainless steel wire loop when lassoed around the nucleus in the anterior chamber constricts from the equator, easily dividing the hardest of the nuclei into two halves. The wire loop constricts in a controlled way when the second cannula of snare is pulled. The divided halves can easily be brought out by serrated crocodile forceps. This nuclear management can be safely performed through a smaller sclerocorneal flap valve incision where the corneal valve action is retained within the limbus without sutures, and the endothelium or the incision is not disturbed. However, the technique requires space in the anterior chamber to maneuver the wire loop and anterior chamber depth more than 2.5 mm is recommended. Much evidence to this wonderful technique is not available in literature, as its popularity grew through live surgical workshops and small interactive conferences.",2009,Indian Journal of Ophthalmology

Data driven discovery of nonlinear dynamics,"We demonstrate that sparse regression and compressive sensing techniques are capable of accurately determining a set of functions governing a nonlinear dynamical system. We analyze a technique introduced by Brunton, Proctor, and Kutz, 2016 [1] that builds a sparse representation of a dynamical system by computing sequential least squares fittings of the data to identify the governing equations. By computing the sparse regression in such a fashion, this method quickly identifies nonzero coefficients and allows them to converge to their respective weight. The result is a sparse representation of the dynamical system in the nonlinear function space. We look at the mechanics of the lasso, discuss the introduction of sparsity to a system by choice of the l1-norm, and investigate the algorithm used in sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics through a sequential least squares method.",2016,

Sequential Lasso Cum EBIC for Feature Selection With Ultra-High Dimensional Feature Space,"In this article, we propose a method called sequential Lasso (SLasso) for feature selection in sparse high-dimensional linear models. The SLasso selects features by sequentially solving partially penalized least squares problems where the features selected in earlier steps are not penalized. The SLasso uses extended BIC (EBIC) as the stopping rule. The procedure stops when EBIC reaches a minimum. The asymptotic properties of SLasso are considered when the dimension of the feature space is ultra high and the number of relevant feature diverges. We show that, with probability converging to 1, the SLasso first selects all the relevant features before any irrelevant features can be selected, and that the EBIC decreases until it attains the minimum at the model consisting of exactly all the relevant features and then begins to increase. These results establish the selection consistency of SLasso. The SLasso estimators of the final model are ordinary least squares estimators. The selection consistency implies the oracle property of SLasso. The asymptotic distribution of the SLasso estimators with diverging number of relevant features is provided. The SLasso is compared with other methods by simulation studies, which demonstrates that SLasso is a desirable approach having an edge over the other methods. The SLasso together with the other methods are applied to a microarray data for mapping disease genes.

bayesQR: A Bayesian Approach to Quantile Regression,"After its introduction by Koenker and Basset (1978), quantile regression has become an important and popular tool to investigate the conditional response distribution in regression. The R package bayesQR contains a number of routines to estimate quantile regression parameters using a Bayesian approach based on the asymmetric Laplace distribution. The package contains functions for the typical quantile regression with continuous dependent variable, but also supports quantile regression for binary dependent variables. For both types of dependent variables, an approach to variable selection using the adaptive lasso approach is provided. For the binary quantile regression model, the package also contains a routine that calculates the fitted probabilities for each vector of predictors. In addition, functions for summarizing the results, creating traceplots, posterior histograms and drawing quantile plots are included. This paper starts with a brief overview of the theoretical background of the models used in the bayesQR package. The main part of this paper discusses the computational problems that arise in the implementation of the procedure and illustrates the usefulness of the package through selected examples.",2017,Journal of Statistical Software
Bayesian sparse sensing of the Japanese 2011 earthquake,Sparse sensing is a technique for finding sparse signal representations to underdetermined linear measurement equations. We use sparse sensing to locate seismic sources during the rupture of the 2011 Mw9.0 earthquake in Japan from teleseismic P waves recorded by a seismic sensor array of stations in the United States. The location estimates of the seismic sources are obtained by minimizing the square of â„“2-norm of the difference between the observed and modeled waveforms penalized by the â„“1-norm of the seismic source vector. The resulting minimization problem is convex and can be solved efficiently using LASSO type optimization. The potential to track the rupture sequentially is demonstrated.,2012,"2012 Conference Record of the Forty Sixth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers (ASILOMAR)"
A comparison between compressed sensing algorithms in Electrical Impedance Tomography,"Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) calculates the internal conductivity distribution within a body using electrical contact measurements. Conventional EIT reconstruction methods solve a linear model by minimizing the least squares error, i.e., the Euclidian or L2-norm, with regularization. Compressed sensing provides unique advantages in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) [1] when the images are transformed to a sparse basis. EIT images are generally sparser than MRI images due to their lower spatial resolution. This leads us to investigate ability of compressed sensing algorithms currently applied to MRI in EIT without transformation to a new basis. In particular, we examine four new iterative algorithms for L1 and L0 minimization with applications to compressed sensing and compare these with current EIT inverse L1-norm regularization methods. The four compressed sensing methods are as follows: (1) an interior point method for solving L1-regularized least squares problems (L1-LS); (2) total variation using a Lagrangian multiplier method (TVAL3); (3) a two-step iterative shrinkage / thresholding method (TWIST) for solving the L0-regularized least squares problem; (4) The Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) with tracing the Pareto curve, which estimates the least squares parameters subject to a L1-norm constraint. In our investigation, using 1600 elements, we found all four CS algorithms provided an improvement over the best conventional EIT reconstruction method, Total Variation, in three important areas: robustness to noise, increased computational speed of at least 40x and a visually apparent improvement in spatial resolution. Out of the four CS algorithms we found TWIST was the fastest with at least a 100x speed increase.",2010,2010 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology
Assessing Fiscal Sustainability: A Review of Methods with a View to EMU,"Balassone and Franco review the literature on fiscal sustainability in order to examine the comparative advantages and disadvantages of different methodologies and indicators and to highlight the areas in which more research effort is still needed. They contrast the intuitive character of the concept of sustainability with the analytical and operational difficulties met with when trying to arrive at a rigorous definition. On the one hand, the literature has not produced a unique definition of sustainability; furthermore, the problem has only been dealt with in a partial equilibrium framework. On the other hand, the statistical definition of the main variables to be used for the assessment of sustainability is not uncontroversial; moreover, as the assessment is based on long-term projections, it is necessarily subject to wide margins of error.Balassone and Franco also point out that, theoretical issues notwithstanding, the Treaty of Maastricht and the Stability and Growth Pact set fiscal rules which, if complied with, ensure sustainability according to any definition adopted. Techniques developed for the analysis of sustainability can therefore be used for the assessment of prospective compliance with such rules, a crucial task for both policy evaluation and timely corrective intervention. In re-examining the pros and cons of available indicators, their paper categorises the studies on the assessment of sustainability into two main strands: those testing for the sustainability of past policies and those assessing prospective fiscal stances. Among the latter a distinction is drawn between works based on standard national accounting concepts and generational accounting exercises. The paper concludes by stressing the need for further efforts to guide budgetary policy more effectively.",2000,

Microbial community of the deep-sea brine Lake Kryos seawater-brine interface is active below the chaotropicity limit of life as revealed by recovery of mRNA.,"Within the complex of deep, hypersaline anoxic lakes (DHALs) of the Mediterranean Ridge, we identified a new, unexplored DHAL and named it 'Lake Kryos' after a nearby depression. This lake is filled with magnesium chloride (MgCl2 )-rich, athalassohaline brine (salinityâ€‰>â€‰470 practical salinity units), presumably formed by the dissolution of Messinian bischofite. Compared with the DHALâ€…Discovery, it contains elevated concentrations of kosmotropic sodium and sulfate ions, which are capable of reducing the net chaotropicily of MgCl2 -rich solutions. The brine of Lake Kryos may therefore be biologically permissive at MgCl2 concentrations previously considered incompatible with life. We characterized the microbiology of the seawater-Kryos brine interface and managed to recover mRNA from the 2.27-3.03â€‰M MgCl2 layer (equivalent to 0.747-0.631 water activity), thereby expanding the established chaotropicity window-for-life. The primary bacterial taxa present there were Kebrit Deep Bacteria 1 candidate division and DHAL-specific group of organisms, distantly related to Desulfohalobium. Two euryarchaeal candidate divisions, Mediterranean Sea Brine Lakes group 1 and halophilic cluster 1, accounted for >â€‰85% of the rRNA-containing archaeal clones derived from the 2.27-3.03â€‰M MgCl2 layer, but were minority community-members in the overlying interface-layers. These findings shed light on the plausibility of life in highly chaotropic environments, geochemical windows for microbial extremophiles, and have implications for habitability elsewhere in the Solar System.",2015,Environmental microbiology

Esta mejora esta modificando uno de los principios tradicionales del mercado de vacuno de leche como era la preferencia de uso de toros con altas fiabilidades frente a otros animales con valores geneticos a priori superiores. Esta tesis contiene seis capitulos en los cuales se estudian de las bases para la implementacion del programa de seleccion genomica en el vacuno de leche espanol. Para ello se realizaron estudios de simulacion y valoraciones genomicas con datos reales de la primera poblacion nacional de referencia. El objetivo principal de esta tesis es contribuir a la implementacion de la seleccion genomica en el vacuno de leche espanol. Los objetivos especificos son: (1) Estudiar alternativas de genotipado en poblaciones reducidas de vacuno lechero. (2) Desarrollar y validar metodologia para la evaluacion de grandes cantidades de genotipos. (3) Estudiar el efecto de los procesos de imputacion de genotipos en la capacidad predictiva de los genotipos resultantes. Las principales cuestiones relacionadas con la seleccion genomica en vacuno lechero fueron discutidas en el capitulo 1 incluyendo: aspectos estadisticos y geneticos en los que se basa la seleccion genomica, diseno de poblaciones de referencia, revision del estado del arte en cuanto a la metodologia desarrollada para evaluacion genomica, diseno y metodos de los algoritmos de imputacion, e implementacion de la seleccion genomica en vacuno de leche a nivel de programa de seleccion, centro de inseminacion y de granja comercial. En el capitulo 2 se realizo un estudio de simulacion comparando estrategias de genotipado selectivo en poblaciones de hembras frente al uso de seleccion tradicional o seleccion genomica con una poblacion de referencia de machos. La poblacion de referencia espanola estaba formada en principio por algo mas de 1,600 toros con prueba de progenie. Este tamano no es, en principio, suficiente para obtener predicciones genomicas de alta fiabilidad. Por tanto, debian evaluarse diferentes alternativas para incrementar la habilidad predictiva de las evaluaciones. Las estrategias que consisten en usar como poblacion de referencia los animales en los extremos de la distribucion fenotipica permitian mejorar la precision de la evaluacion. Los resultados usando 1,000 genotipos fueron 0.50 para el caracter de baja heredabilidad y 0.63 para el de heredabilidad media cuando la variable dependiente fue el fenotipo ajustado. Cuando se usaron valores geneticos como variable dependiente las correlaciones fueron 0.48 y 0.63 respectivamente. Para los mismos caracteres, una poblacion de 996 machos obtuvo correlaciones de 0.48 y 0.55 en las predicciones posteriores. El estudio concluye que la estrategia de genotipado que proporciona la mayor correlacion es la que incluye las hembras de ambas colas de la distribucion de fenotipos. Por otro lado se pone de manifiesto que la mera inclusion de las hembras elite que son las habitualmente genotipadas en las poblaciones reales produce resultados no satisfactorios en la prediccion de valores genomicos. En el capitulo 3, el Random Boosting (R-Boost) es comparado con otros metodos de evaluacion genomica como Bayes-A, LASSO Bayesiano y G-BLUP. La poblacion de referencia espanola y caracteres incluidos en las evaluaciones geneticas tradicionales de vacuno lechero fueron usados para comparar estos metodos en terminos de precision y sesgo. Las predicciones genomicas fueron mas precisas que el indice de pedigri tradicional a la hora de predecir los resultados de futuros test de progenie como era de esperar. Las ganancias en precision debidas al empleo de la seleccion genomica dependen del caracter evaluado y variaron entre 0.04 (Profundidad de ubre) y 0.42 (Porcentaje de grasa) unidades de correlacion de Pearson. Los resultados promediados entre caracteres mostraron que el LASSO Bayesiano obtuvo mayores correlaciones superando al R-Boost, Bayes-A y G-BLUP en 0.01, 0.03 y 0.03 unidades respectivamente. Las predicciones obtenidas con el LASSO Bayesiano tambien mostraron menos desviaciones en la media, 0.02, 0.03 y 0.10 menos que Bayes-A, R-Boost y G-BLUP, respectivamente. Las predicciones usando R-Boost obtuvieron coeficientes de regresion mas proximos a la unidad que el resto de metodos y los errores medios cuadraticos fueron un 2%, 10% y 12% inferiores a los obtenidos a partir del B-LASSO, Bayes-A y G-BLUP, respectivamente. El estudio concluye que R- Boost es una metodologia aplicable a seleccion genomica y competitiva en terminos de capacidad predictiva. En el capitulo 4, el algoritmo de machine learning R-Boost evaluado en el capitulo 3 es descrito e implementado para seleccion genomica adaptado a la evaluacion de grandes bases de datos de una forma eficiente. Tras la incorporacion en el consorcio Eurogenomics, el programa genomico espanol paso a disponer de mas de 22,000 toros probados como poblacion de referencia, por tanto era necesario implementar un metodo capaz de evaluar este gran conjunto de datos en un tiempo razonable. El nuevo algoritmo denominado R-Boost realiza de forma secuencial un muestreo aleatorio de SNPs en cada iteracion sobre los cuales se aplica un predictor debil. El algoritmo fue evaluado sobre datos reales de vacuno de leche empleados en el capitulo 3 estudiando mas en profundidad el comportamiento de los parametros de sintonizacion. Esta propuesta de modificacion del Boosting puede obtener predicciones sin perdida de precision o incrementos de sesgo empleando tan solo un 1% del tiempo de computacion original. En el capitulo 5 se evalua el efecto de usar genotipos de baja densidad imputados con el software Beagle en cuanto a su posterior habilidad predictiva cuando son incorporados a la poblacion de referencia. Para ello se emplearon dos metodos de evaluacion R-Boost y un BLUP con matriz genomica. Animales de los que se conocian los SNPs incluidos en los chips GoldenGate Bovine 3K y BovineLD BeadChip, fueron imputados hasta conocer los SNPs incluidos en el BovineSNP50v2 BeadChip. Posteriormente, un segundo proceso de imputacion obtuvo los SNPs incluidos en el BovineHD BeadChip. Tras imputatar desde dos genotipados a baja densidad, se obtuvo similar capacidad predictiva a la obtenida empleando los originales en densidad 50K. Sin embargo, solo se obtuvo una pequena mejora (0.002 unidades de Pearson) al imputar a HD. El mayor incremento se obtuvo para el caracter dias abiertos donde las correlaciones en el grupo de validacion aumentaron en 0.06 unidades de Pearson las correlaciones en el grupo de validacion cuando se emplearon los genotipos imputados a HD. En funcion de la densidad de genotipado, el algoritmo R-Boost mostro mayores diferencias que el G-BLUP. Ambos metodos obtuvieron resultados similares salvo en el caso de porcentaje de grasa, donde las predicciones obtenidas con el R-Boost fueron superiores a las del G-BLUP en 0.20 unidades de correlacion de Pearson. El estudio concluye que la capacidad predictiva para algunos caracteres puede mejorar imputando la poblacion de referencia a HD asi como empleando metodos de evaluacion capaces de adaptarse a las distintas arquitecturas geneticas posibles. Finalmente en el capitulo 6 se desarrolla una discusion general de los estudios presentados en los capitulos anteriores y se enlazan con la implementacion de la seleccion genomica en el vacuno lechero espanol, que se ha desarrollado en paralelo a esta tesis doctoral. La primera poblacion de referencia con unos 1.600 toros fue evaluada en el capitulo 4 y fue usada para comparar los distintos metodos y escenarios propuestos en los capitulos 3, 4 y 5. La primera evaluacion genomica obtenida para los caracteres incluidos en el capitulo 4 de esta tesis estuvo disponible para los centros de inseminacion incluidos en el programa en septiembre de 2011. La poblacion de Eurogenomics se incorporo en Noviembre de dicho ano, completandose la primera evaluacion para los caracteres incluidos en el indice de seleccion ICO en Febrero de 2012 empleando el R-Boost descrito en el capitulo 3. En mayo de 2012 las evaluaciones del caracter proteina fueron validadas por Interbull y finalmente el 30 de Noviembre del 2012 las primeras evaluaciones genomicas oficiales fueron publicadas on-line por la federacion de ganaderos CONAFE (http://www.conafe.com/noticias/20121130a.htm).",2013,
A hybrid quasi-Newton projected-gradient method with application to Lasso and basis-pursuit denoising,"We propose a new algorithm for the optimization of convex functions over a polyhedral set in $${\mathbb {R}}^n$$Rn. The algorithm extends the spectral projected-gradient method with limited-memory BFGS iterates restricted to the present face whenever possible. We prove convergence of the algorithm under suitable conditions and apply the algorithm to solve the Lasso problem, and consequently, the basis-pursuit denoise problem through the root-finding framework proposed by van den Berg and Friedlander (SIAM J Sci Comput 31(2):890â€“912, 2008). The algorithm is especially well suited to simple domains and could also be used to solve bound-constrained problems as well as problems restricted to the simplex.",2019,Mathematical Programming Computation

Estimating the Structure of Social Interactions Using Panel Data,"I consider settings where outcomes depend on own characteristics and on the characteristics of other individuals in the sample. I propose a method to identify individuals generating spillovers and their strength using panel data on outcomes and characteristics. This is in contrast to existing approaches, which require a priori knowledge of the structure of interactions. The method is suitable when the structure of interactions is stable over time and few individuals generate spillovers distinct in magnitude from the rest. To estimate the model, I introduce the Pooled Lasso estimator, a paneldata counterpart of the Lasso estimator and develop an iterative algorithm for computation that alternates between Lasso estimation and pooled panel regression. Average marginal spillover effects across individuals enjoy gains in the rate of convergence under independence of model selection noise. I apply this methodology to study technological spillovers in productivity in a panel of US firms. I find evidence that spillovers are asymmetric across firms, arising mostly from small, highly productive firms.",2013,
IPF-LASSO: Integrative L 1-Penalized Regression with Penalty Factors for Prediction Based on Multi-Omics Data,"As modern biotechnologies advance, it has become increasingly frequent that different modalities of high-dimensional molecular data (termed ""omics"" data in this paper), such as gene expression, methylation, and copy number, are collected from the same patient cohort to predict the clinical outcome. While prediction based on omics data has been widely studied in the last fifteen years, little has been done in the statistical literature on the integration of multiple omics modalities to select a subset of variables for prediction, which is a critical task in personalized medicine. In this paper, we propose a simple penalized regression method to address this problem by assigning different penalty factors to different data modalities for feature selection and prediction. The penalty factors can be chosen in a fully data-driven fashion by cross-validation or by taking practical considerations into account. In simulation studies, we compare the prediction performance of our approach, called IPF-LASSO (Integrative LASSO with Penalty Factors) and implemented in the R package ipflasso, with the standard LASSO and sparse group LASSO. The use of IPF-LASSO is also illustrated through applications to two real-life cancer datasets. All data and codes are available on the companion website to ensure reproducibility.",2017,Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine
"Thalassotalea montiporae sp. nov., isolated from the encrusting pore coral Montipora aequituberculata.","A bacterial strain, designated CL-22T, was isolated from an encrusting pore coral, Montipora aequituberculata, collected off the coast of Southern Taiwan. Its taxonomic position was investigated using a polyphasic approach. Cells of strain CL-22T were Gram-stain-negative, aerobic, motile by means of a single polar flagellum, rod-shaped and formed yellow colonies. Optimal growth occurred at 30â€‰Â°C, pH 6.5-7 and in 2â€‰% (w/v) NaCl. A neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree, based on 16S rRNA gene sequences, showed that strain CL-22T fell into the clade comprising the type strains of species of the genus Thalassotalea. Strain CL-22T exhibited 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity values of 94.7-97.1â€‰% to the type strains of species of the genus Thalassotalea. The major fatty acids (>10â€‰%) of strain CL-22T were summed feature 3 (C16â€‰:â€‰1Ï‰7c and/or C16â€‰:â€‰1Ï‰6c) and C16â€‰:â€‰0. The predominant isoprenoid quinone was Q-8. The major polar lipids were phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylglycerol. The genomic DNA G+C content of strain CL-22T was 41.2 mol%. The differential phenotypic properties, together with the phylogenetic inference, demonstrate that strain CL-22T should be classified as a novel species of the genus Thalassotalea; the name Thalassotalea montiporae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is CL-22T (=LMG 24827T=BCRC 17940T).",2016,International journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology
Clinical application of ICF key codes to evaluate patients with dysphagia following stroke,"AbstractThis study was aimed to identify and evaluate the International Classification of Functioning (ICF) key codes for dysphagia in stroke patients. Thirty patients with dysphagia after stroke were enrolled in our study. To evaluate the ICF dysphagia scale, 6 scales were used as comparisons, namely the Barthel Index (BI), Repetitive Saliva Swallowing Test (RSST), Kubota Water Swallowing Test (KWST), Frenchay Dysarthria Assessment, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Multiple regression analysis was performed to quantitate the relationship between the ICF scale and the other 7 scales. In addition, 60 ICF scales were analyzed by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method. A total of 21 ICF codes were identified, which were closely related with the other scales. These included 13 codes from Body Function, 1 from Body Structure, 3 from Activities and Participation, and 4 from Environmental Factors. A topographic network map with 30 ICF key codes was also generated to visualize their relationships. The number of ICF codes identified is in line with other well-established evaluation methods. The network topographic map generated here could be used as an instruction tool in future evaluations. We also found that attention functions and biting were critical codes of these scales, and could be used as treatment targets.",2016,Medicine
"Siphonophores (Cnidaria, Hydrozoa) collected during the ""Magga Dan"" Expedition (1966-67) from Africa to Antarctica",Nine species of siphonophores were collected during the Belgian?Magga Da? Expedition in a transect from South Africa to Antarctic waters between December 1966 and February 1967. Two species were recorded for the first time in Antarctic waters: Bargmannia elongata and Nanomia bijuga. The bracts of Thalassophyes crystallina were found and described from material collected during this expedition. Two substantial colonies of Mica micula allowed a redescription of species and its systematic position is discussed.,1989,Scientia Marina
The Effects of the AIDS Epidemic on the Safety of the Nation ' s Blood Supply,"The development of a safe and effective vaccine against infection by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is of paramount importance to the prevention of AIDS worldwide. Although a great deal has been learned about HIV in a few short years, the development of an AIDS vaccine has proved to be extremely difficult. The lack of an appropriate animal model for AIDS, the absence of a defined protective immune response in persons infected with HIV, the long latent period between initial infection and the development of symptoms, the existence of multiple strains of HIV, and the spread of HIV by way of cellassociated virus are issues that complicate the development of an effective AIDS vaccine.",2006,
"Community Structure of Seagrass Meadows In Mantehage Island Waters, North Sulawesi","Research on the structure of seagrass communities in the waters of the island Mantehage was conducted in September 2010. The purpose of this study is to collect data and information on the structure of seagrass communities. Observations includes the identification seagrass species, measuring the number of individual/stand, cover percentage of each type/species on the transect. 6 types of seagrass found, i.e. Enhalus acoroides, Halophila ovalis, Thalassia hemprichii, Thalassodendron ciliatum, Cymodocea rotundata and Syringodium isoetifolium. Seagrass species composition and distribution varies at each location and is dominated by the presence of Thalassia hemprichii (48.14%) with coverage percentage ranges between 15.91% to 35.11%. Diversity index values ranged from 0.79 to 1.69 ; evenness index between 0.57 to 0.94 and the index of dominance between 0.20 to 0.56. In conclusion, the condition of seagrass meadows in Mantehage island is relatively good and can support marine life adequately. Keywords : Structure communities, seagrass, Mantehage Island",2014,
Polychlorinated biphenyl-induced alterations of thyroid hormone homeostasis and brain development in the rat,"The metabolism and distribution of a single oral dose of 25 umol [C]-3,3',4,4'tetrachlorobiphenyl (TCB) were investigated in pregnant female Wistar rats and their fetuses. TCB was administered on day 13 of gestation and the elimination was followed for 7 days. Non-pregnant rats were treated similarly for comparison. Fecal elimination of [C]-TCB derived radioactivity was significantly lower in pregnant rats than in nonpregnant rats. The major metabolite found in adult liver and plasma, placental tissue, whole fetuses and fetal plasma was 3,3',4',5-tetrachloro-4-biphenylol (4-OH-tetraCB). Tissue levels (liver, abdominal fat, skin, skeletal muscle, kidney and plasma) of [C]TCB-derived radioactivity declined by 65 to 85% over a 7 day period following administration in the adult animals. However, [C]-TCB-derived radioactivity accumulated more than 100-fold in the fetuses over the same time period, and GC/MS analysis revealed that the fetal accumulation in radioactivity was due primarily to 4-OHtetraCB, and not the parent compound. On day 20 of gestation, concentrations of 4-OHtetraCB were 14 times greater in fetal plasma than maternal plasma. Treatment with [C]-TCB significantly reduced plasma thyroxine levels by at least 28% up to 7 days after administration in non-pregnant animals and up to 4 days after administration in pregnant rats (31% decrease). By 7 days after administration plasma thyroxine levels had returned to control levels in the TCB-treated pregnant rats. However, fetal plasma thyroxine levels were significantly decreased by 35% in fetuses from [C]-TCB-treated dams 7 days after TCB administration. Hepatic microsomal ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity was significantly induced in TCB-treated dams relative to controls at 4 and 7 days after administration, while no EROD activity was detected in hepatic microsomes from control or TCB treated fetal rats at day 20 of gestation. These data suggest that hydroxylated metabolites of polychlorinated biphenyls may play a role in the development toxicity of these compounds. Dennis C.

Important biological activities induced by Thalassophryne maculosa fish venom.,"The accidents caused by Thalassophryne maculosa fish venoms are frequent and represent a public health problem in some regions of Venezuela. Most accidents occur in the fishing communities and tourists. The clinical picture is characterized by severe pain, dizziness, fever, edema, and necrosis. Due to the lack of efficient therapy it may take weeks, or even months for complete recovery of the victims. The investigations presented here were undertaken to assess the eletrophoretical profile and principal biological properties of the T. maculosa venom. Venom obtained from fresh captured specimens of this fish was tested in vitro or in animal models for a better characterization of its toxic activities. In contrast to other fish venoms, T. maculosa venom showed relative low LD50. The injection of venom in the footpad of mice reproduced a local inflammatory lesion similar to that described in humans. Significant increase of the nociceptive and edematogenic responses was observed followed within 48 h by necrosis. Pronounced alterations on microvascular hemodynamics were visualized after venom application. These alterations were represented by fibrin depots and thrombus formation followed by complete venular stasis and transient arteriolar contraction. T. maculosa venom is devoid of phospholipase A2 activity, but the venom showed proteolytic and myotoxic activities. SDS-Page analysis of the crude venom showed important bands: one band located above 97 M(w), one band between 68 and 97 M(w), one major band between 29 and 43 M(w) and the last one located below 18.4 M(w) Then, the results presented here support that T. maculosa venom present a mixture of bioactive toxins involved in a local inflammatory lesion.",2005,Toxicon : official journal of the International Society on Toxinology
Evolution of coral reef fish Thalassoma spp. (Labridae). 2. Evolution of the eastern Atlantic species,"The genetic relationships within and among congeneric species of marine fish from the Atlantic and the Mediterranean are poorly known. Relationships among all five species of the wrasse genus Thalassoma present in the Atlantic and the Mediterranean were examined using sequence data from the mitochondrial control region. Sampling was focused on the mid-Atlantic T. sanctaehelenae (Valenciennes, 1839) and T. ascensionis (Quoy & Gaimard, 1834), the eastern Atlantic T. newtoni (OsÃ³rio, 1891) from Sao Tome, and the eastern Atlantic/Mediterranean T. pavo (Linnaeus, 1758). Two western Atlantic species T. bifasciatum (Bloch, 1791) from the Caribbean and T. noronhanum (Boulenger, 1890) from Brazil served as outgroups. Tissues from a total of 132Â individuals were sequenced. T. newtoni from Sao Tome preferentially grouped with the central Atlantic T. sanctaehelenae and T. ascensionis. T. pavo exhibits two distinct coloration patterns, one in the Cape Verde Islands and one in the eastern Atlantic Islands and Mediterranean. However, no genetic discontinuities between the Cape Verde Islands and the remaining samples or between Atlantic and Mediterranean individuals were found. Within Mediterranean populations of T. pavo, our data suggested the presence of a genetic break between eastern and western regions.",2004,Marine Biology
Erweiterung der Grenze des mikroskopischen AuflÃ¶sungsvermÃ¶gens mit Hilse des Ultraviolett-Mikrofkopes. Das Fluoreszenz-MikroSkop,"Wie aus der Formel fur die Grenze des Auflosungsvermogens fur das Mikroskop (S.44) folgt, gibt es zwei Wege, die Auflosungsfahig-keit der Mikroskopoptik zu Steigern. Der eine besteht in der Vergroserung der numerischen Apertur der Objektive, der andere in der Verwendung von Licht mit moglichst kleiner Wellenlange. Abbe hat in der Monobromnaphthalin-Immersion die Apertur bis an die Grenze gesteigert, welche mit den heutigen Glassorten zu erreichen ist. Eine weitere erhebliche Steigerung ist wohl fur langere Seiten schwerlich zu erwarten. Der andere Weg hat dagegen zu einer bedeutenden Steigerung des mikroskopischen Auflosungsvermogens uber die Grenze der Monobromnaphthalin-Immersion hinaus gefuhrt. Auserhalb des fichtbaren Spek-trums, jenfeits der Grenze des violetten Lichtes von etwa 400 Î¼Î¼ Wellenlange abwarts, existieren noch Atherschwingungen von kurzerer Wellenlange, das ultraviolette Licht.

Research on suspended sediment of upland small forest watershed in Japan,"With upland small forest watershed in Japan as the objective,the relationship between discharge and flood processes of suspended sediment were researched using automatic samplers(ISCO) and water-stage recorder.Results show that the major sources of sediment are forest paths,stream channels and the bare land beside stream channels.The concentration of suspended sediment is well interrelated with that of total sediment.The change of concentration of suspended sediment with the discharge processes follows a clockwise variable lasso.The discharge process of suspended sediment shows a wave-pattern.The maximum concentration of suspended sediment and peak discharge appear almost at the same time,which belong to the synchronic pattern.The discharge amount of suspended sediment is mainly decided by the maximum precipitation in 10 min,each rainfall also greatly contributes to suspended sediment discharge.Suspended sediment discharge from one storm accounts for about 5% of the total annual sediment discharge.A few storms contribute 30% of yearly suspended sediment discharge.",2005,Journal of Beijing Forestry University
"An Ecological Assessment Of Littoral Seagrass Communities In Diani And Galu Coastal Beaches, Kenya","Most studies along the Kenyan coast have concentrated on coral reefs and mangrove swamps. Limited studies have been carried out on seagrasses though they provide an important link between the mangroves and the coral reefs. Seagrass beds are located in intertidal lagoons which lie directly in front of coastal hotels, hence they are thought to be affected by hotel sewage through underground seepage particularly where the sewage disposal systems are located close to the shore. The aim of this study was to ascertain the effects of this on the marine life sustained by the seagrass community. The flora, fauna and physico-chemical parameters of the littoral seagrass community in Diani Beach, a tourist resort located in the south coast of Kenya, was compared to the one in Galu Beach, a relatively unexploited area in terms of beach hotel development. The mean biomass of seagrass was significantly higher in Diani Beach (H = 6.96, p < 0.05). Though the algal biomass was higher in Diani Beach, a comparison between the two areas revealed that the difference was not statistically significant. The epiphytic load on the stems of the seagrass Thalassodendron ciliatum (Forssk.) den Hartog was significantly different (H = 18.13, p < 0.05). However, the abundance of the epiphytes was governed by the availability of T. ciliatum stems in both Diani and Galu Beaches. The mean number of epibenthic fauna and infauna were higher in Diani Beach though (xxiv)",1995,
[Treatment of the old terrible triad of the elbow without operative history].,"OBJECTIVE
To introduce the surgical techniques and treating results of the old ""terrible triad"" of the elbow.


METHODS
A retrospective analysis of 11 cases of old ""terrible triad"" of the elbow treated by the author from March 2009 to February 2014 were performed, with 9 males and 2 females; mean age was (31.82Â±8.66) years (17-45 years). The average time after injury was (6.36Â±2.50) weeks (4-12 weeks), with 7 cases on the left and 4 right. The combined injury included 2 cases with distal radius fractures, 1 with ankle fractures, fractures of the distal radius and the head injury (minor epidural hematoma, no surgery), and 1 with Pilon fractures and L4 fractures (fixed at local hospital). All the patients had elbow stiffness and joint dislocation, and 2 patients had symptoms of ulnar nerve. Mason classification of radial head fractures: 2 cases were type I, 5 were type II, 4 were type III. Classification of the coronoid process: Regan & Morrey: 1 was type I, 10 were type II; according to O'Driscoll classification, all the fractures were tip fracture, one was the first subtype, 10 were the second subtype. The elbow were released, the coronoid process were fixed by lasso suture combined with Kirschner wires. Radial head fractures were resected in 1 case, and replaced in 1 case, 3 cases with no treatment, 6 cases with osteotomy and 3.0 mm headless compression screw (HCS) fixation. The lateral collateral ligament complex and the common extensor tendon were repaired to the humeral lateral epicondyles, No.2 Ethibon was used in 2 cases through bone holes, and suture anchorsin the other 9 cases. All the patients were fixed by Stryker DJD II hinged external fixator to protect the bone and soft tissue.


RESULTS
The average follow-up time was (38.36Â±21.92) months (19-77 months). All the patients had no obvious pain, instability and ulnar nerve symptoms in the last follow-up. The average elbow flexion was 134.09Â°Â±12.41Â° (100Â°-140Â°), average extension was -15.91Â°Â±14.46 Â° (-40Â°-0Â°), range of flexion and extension was 118.18Â°Â±23.80Â° (70Â°-140Â°). Average pronation was 70.91Â°Â±26.63Â° (20Â°-90Â°), supination was 70.91Â°Â±26.63Â° (20Â°-100 Â°). The range of motion (ROM) of forearm rotation was 150.91Â°Â±43.00Â° (40Â°-180Â°). Average Mayo elbow performance score (MEPS) was 96.36Â±5.04 (85- 100).X-ray showed that no degenerative changes. Five patients had heterotopic ossifications, according to Hastings and Graham grading: 1 case was grade I, 3 cases were grade IIA, 1 case was IIB.


CONCLUSION
The old ""terrible triad"" of elbow with no operative history is difficult to treat. The elbow's functions and stabilization can be recovered by thorough elbow release, repair of coronoid process and anterior capsule, radial head fractures, lateral collateral ligament and the common extensor tendon insertion, combined with hinged external fixator. Joint stiffness and heterotopic ossification are common complications.",2016,Beijing da xue xue bao. Yi xue ban = Journal of Peking University. Health sciences
"The Stratigraphic Classification and Correlation of Jurassic in Caohu Depression,Tarim Basin","The Jurassic of Caohu depression in the Tarim basin developed fully,with large thickness,but the precision of stratigraphic division and correlation is lower,which is one of the important reason that restrict the exploration of oil and gas in this aera.According to the fossil material collected from drilling hole,established three palynological assemblages,there are Cyathidites-Osmundacidites-Piceites,Cyathiditesâ€“Neoraistrickia-Disacciatrileti and CyathiditesClassopollis-Piceaepollenites,Aneuletes cucuma and A.stellerides-A.lufengensis,A.maxima-P.kucheensis.The Jurassic was divided into three series,five formations,From bottom to top are Ahe Formation and Yangxia Formation in lower seriesã€Kizilnur Formation and Qiakmak Formation in middle series and Qigu Formation in upper series(Kelazha Formation is lacuna).Lithological and logging characterastics are obvious in each member,the ""coal stratification""at the lower and ""black mudstone sagment"" at the top of the Yangxia Formation,the ""coal stratification"" in the kizilnur Formation and the ""red mudstone sagment"" were regarded as the key bed in this research area.There is sedimentic absence in the Ahe Formation and the lower parts in the Yangxia Formation,denuded absence from Qiakmak Formation to Kelazha Formation in most aera.Jurassic was divided into three second-order and five third-order sequences,relied on the seismic sequence stratigraphy and borehole sequence stratigraphy,the detailded classification and correlation of Jurassic in the aera has been achieved,which based on biostratum and combined litology,sequence and logging strata.Those discoveries made it possible to analyze the tectonic evolution,sedimentary facies and hydrocarbon accumulation in Caohu sag and neighbouring regions.",2012,Xinjiang Geology
Understanding Behavioral Differences Between Short and Long-Term Drinking Abstainers from Social Media,"Drinking alcohol has high cost on society. The journey from being a regular drinker to a successful quitter may be a long and hard journey, fraught with the risk to relapse. Research has shown that certain behavioral changes can be effective towards staying abstained. Traditional way to conduct research on drinking abstainers uses questionnaire based approach to collect data from a curated group of people. However, it is an expensive approach in both cost and time and often results in small data with less diversity. Recently, social media has emerged as a rich data source. Reddit is one such social media platform that has a community (â€˜subredditâ€™) with an interest to quit drinking. The discussions among the group dates back to year 2011 and contain more than 40,000 posts. This large scale data is generated by users themselves and without being limited by any survey questionnaires. The most predictive factors from the features (unigrams, topics and LIWC) associated with short-term and long-term abstinence are identified using Lasso. It is seen that many common patterns manifest in unigrams, topics and LIWC. Whilst topics provided much richer associations between a group of words and the outcome, unigrams and LIWC are found to be good at finding highly predictive solo and psycho linguistically important words. Combining them we have found that many interesting patterns that are associated with the successful attempt made by the long-term abstainer, at the same time finding many of the common issues faced during the initial period of abstinence.",2016,
L1 regularization method in electrical impedance tomography by using the L1-curve (Pareto frontier curve),"Abstract Electrical impedance tomography (EIT), as an inverse problem, aims to calculate the internal conductivity distribution at the interior of an object from currentâ€“voltage measurements on its boundary. Many inverse problems are ill-posed, since the measurement data are limited and imperfect. To overcome ill-posedness in EIT, two main types of regularization techniques are widely used. One is categorized as the projection methods, such as truncated singular value decomposition (SVD or TSVD). The other categorized as penalty methods, such as Tikhonov regularization, and total variation methods. For both of these methods, a good regularization parameter should yield a fair balance between the perturbation error and regularized solution. In this paper a new method combining the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and the basis pursuit denoising (BPDN) is introduced for EIT. For choosing the optimum regularization we use the L1-curve (Pareto frontier curve) which is similar to the L-curve used in optimising L2-norm problems. In the L1-curve we use the L1-norm of the solution instead of the L2 norm. The results are compared with the TSVD regularization method where the best regularization parameters are selected by observing the Picard condition and minimizing generalized cross validation (GCV) function. We show that this method yields a good regularization parameter corresponding to a regularized solution. Also, in situations where little is known about the noise level Ïƒ , it is also useful to visualize the L1-curve in order to understand the trade-offs between the norms of the residual and the solution. This method gives us a means to control the sparsity and filtering of the ill-posed EIT problem. Tracing this curve for the optimum solution can decrease the number of iterations by three times in comparison with using LASSO or BPDN separately.",2012,Applied Mathematical Modelling
The estimation performance of nonlinear least squares for phase retrieval,"Suppose that $\mathbf{y}=\lvert A\mathbf{x_0}\rvert+\eta$ where $\mathbf{x_0} \in \mathbb{R}^d$ is the target signal and $\eta\in \mathbb{R}^m$ is a noise vector. The aim of phase retrieval is to estimate $\mathbf{x_0}$ from $\mathbf{y}$. A popular model for estimating $\mathbf{x_0} $ is the nonlinear least square $ \widehat{\mathbf{x}}:={\rm argmin}_{\mathbf{x}} \| \lvert A \mathbf{x}\rvert-\mathbf{y}\|_2$. One already develops many efficient algorithms for solving the model, such as the seminal error reduction algorithm. In this paper, we present the estimation performance of the model with proving that $\|\widehat{\mathbf{x}}-\mathbf{x_0} \|\lesssim {\|\eta\|_2}/{\sqrt{m}}$ under the assumption of $A$ being a Gaussian random matrix. We also prove the reconstruction error ${\|\eta\|_2}/{\sqrt{m}}$ is sharp. For the case where $\mathbf{x_0}$ is sparse, we study the estimation performance of both the nonlinear Lasso of phase retrieval and its unconstrained version. Our results are non-asymptotic, and we do not assume any distribution on the noise $\eta$. To the best of our knowledge, our results represent the first theoretical guarantee for the nonlinear least square and for the nonlinear Lasso of phase retrieval.",2019,ArXiv
A Novel Predictive Model to Estimate the Number of Mature Oocytes Required for Obtaining at Least One Euploid Blastocyst for Transfer in Couples Undergoing in vitro Fertilization/Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection: The ART Calculator,"The POSEIDON group (Patient-Oriented Strategies Encompassing IndividualizeD Oocyte Number) has introduced ""the ability to retrieve the number of oocytes needed to achieve at least one euploid embryo for transfer"" as an intermediate marker of successful outcome in IVF/ICSI cycles. This study aimed to develop a novel calculator to predict the POSEIDON marker. We analyzed clinical and embryonic data of infertile couples who underwent IVF/ICSI with the intention to have trophectoderm biopsy for preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy. We used the negative binomial distribution to model the number of euploid blastocysts and the adaptive LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) method for variable selection. The fitted model selected female age, sperm source used for ICSI, and the number of mature (metaphase II) oocytes as predictors (p < 0.0001). Female age was the most important factor for predicting the probability of a blastocyst being euploid given each mature oocyte (loglikelihood of age [adjusted for sperm source]: 30.9; df = 2; p < 0.0001). The final predictive model was developed using logistic regression analysis, and internally validated by the holdout method. The predictive ability of the model was assessed by the ROC curve, which resulted in an area under the curve of 0.716. Using the final model and mathematical equations, we calculated the individualized probability of blastocyst euploidy per mature retrieved oocyte and the minimum number of mature oocytes required to obtain â‰¥1 euploid blastocyst-with their 95% confidence interval [CI]-for different probabilities of success. The estimated predicted probabilities of a mature oocyte turn into a euploid blastocyst decreased progressively with female age and was negatively modulated overall by use of testicular sperm across age (p < 0.001). A calculator was developed to make two types of predictions automatically, one using pretreatment information to estimate the minimum number of mature oocytes to achieve â‰¥1 euploid blastocyst, and another based on the actual number of mature oocytes collected/accumulated to estimate the chances of having a euploid blastocyst using that oocyte cohort for IVF/ICSI. The new ART calculator may assist in clinical counseling and individualized treatment planning regarding the number of oocytes required for at least one euploid blastocyst in IVF/ICSI procedures.",2019,Frontiers in Endocrinology
Pulmonary function in asthmatic children during thalassotherapy.,"In 39 asthmatic children, 5-14 years of age, sent to the Kinderkurheim SatteldÃ¼ne for a 6 week course of thalassotherapy, the following pulmonary function studies were tested serially: Vital capacity (VC), one-second forced expiratory volume (FEV1), maximal mid-expiratory flow rate (MMFR) and peak flow rate (PFR). Results expressed as mean values per week of the group as a whole, showed subnormal results at initial testing in all 4 parameters measured. Improvement followed rapidly with the final level generally achieved during week 2. However, statistical analysis showed the differences between the initial and each of the subsequent values to be insignificant with one exception in the FEV1 values. Thus the clinical improvement observed in most patients during thalassotherapy could not be substantiated by pulmonary function tests.",1975,Padiatrie und Padologie
Performance Analysis of Approximate Message Passing for Distributed Compressed Sensing,"Bayesian approximate message passing (BAMP) is an efficient method in compressed sensing that is nearly optimal in the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) sense. Multiple measurement vector (MMV)-BAMP performs joint recovery of multiple vectors with identical support and accounts for correlations in the signal of interest and in the noise. In this paper, we show how to reduce the complexity of vector BAMP via a simple joint decorrelation (diagonalization) transform of the signal and noise vectors, which also facilitates the subsequent performance analysis. We prove that the corresponding state evolution is equivariant with respect to the joint decorrelation transform and preserves diagonality of the residual noise covariance for the Bernoulliâ€“Gauss prior. We use these results to analyze the dynamics and the mean squared error (MSE) performance of BAMP via the replica method, and thereby understand the impact of signal correlation and number of jointly sparse signals. Finally, we evaluate an application of MMV-BAMP for single-pixel imaging with correlated color channels and thereby explore the performance gain of joint recovery compared to conventional BAMP reconstruction as well as group lasso.",2018,IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing

LASSOâ€Type Penalties for Covariate Selection and Forecasting in Time Series,"This paper studies some forms of LASSO-type penalties in time series to reduce the dimensionality of the parameter space as well as to improve out-of-sample forecasting performance. In particular, we propose a method that we call WLadaLASSO (weighted lag adaptive LASSO), which assigns not only different weights to each coefficient but also further penalizes coefficients of higher-lagged covariates. In our Monte Carlo implementation, the WLadaLASSO is superior in terms of covariate selection, parameter estimation precision and forecasting, when compared to both LASSO and adaLASSO, especially for a higher number of candidate lags and a stronger linear dependence between predictors. Empirical studies illustrate our approach for US risk premium and US inflation forecasting with good results. Copyright Â© 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",2016,Journal of Forecasting
"Thalassotalea atypica sp. nov., isolated from seawater, and emended description of Thalassotalea eurytherma.","A novel Gram-stain-negative, straight or slightly curved rod-shaped, non-spore-forming, non-flagellated, strictly aerobic strain, designated RZG4-3-1T, was isolated from coastal seawater of Rizhao, China (119.625Â° E 35.517Â° N). The organism grew optimally at 24-28â€‰Â°C, at pH 7.0 and in the presence of 2.0â€Š% (w/v) NaCl. The strain required seawater or artificial seawater for growth, and NaCl alone did not support growth. Strain RZG4-3-1T contained ubiquinone 8 (Q-8) as the major respiratory quinone and contained C16â€Š:â€Š1Ï‰7c and/or C16â€Š:â€Š1Ï‰6c and C16â€Š:â€Š0 as the dominant fatty acids. The polar lipids of strain RZG4-3-1T were phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol and one unidentified aminophospholipid. The DNA G+Câ€‰content of strain RZG4-3-1T was 40.1â€‰mol%. Strain RZG4-3-1T exhibited the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity value (96.0â€Š%) to Thalassotalea eurytherma JCM 18482T. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain RZG4-3-1T belonged to the genus Thalassotalea. On the basis of polyphasic analyses, strain RZG4-3-1T represents a novel species of the genus Thalassotalea, for which the name Thalassotalea atypica sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is RZG4-3-1T (=JCM 31894T=KCTC 52745T=MCCC 1K03276T).

The Frischâ€“Waughâ€“Lovell theorem for the lasso and the ridge regression,"ABSTRACT The Frischâ€“Waughâ€“Lovell (FWL) (partitioned regression) theorem is essential in regression analysis. This is partly because it is quite useful to derive theoretical results. The lasso regression and the ridge regression, both of which are penalized least-squares regressions, have become popular statistical techniques. This article describes that the FWL theorem remains valid for these penalized least-squares regressions. More precisely, we demonstrate that the covariates corresponding to unpenalized regression parameters in these penalized least-squares regression can be projected out. Some other results related to the FWL theorem in such penalized least-squares regressions are also presented.",2017,Communications in Statistics - Theory and Methods
Prediction of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer outcomes assessed by innovative multimarker prognostic models,"BackgroundWe adapted Bayesian statistical learning strategies to the prognosis field to investigate if genome-wide common SNP improve the prediction ability of clinico-pathological prognosticators and applied it to non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) patients.MethodsAdapted Bayesian sequential threshold models in combination with LASSO were applied to consider the time-to-event and the censoring nature of data. We studied 822 NMIBC patients followed-up >10Â years. The study outcomes were time-to-first-recurrence and time-to-progression. The predictive ability of the models including up to 171,304 SNP and/or 6 clinico-pathological prognosticators was evaluated using AUC-ROC and determination coefficient.ResultsClinico-pathological prognosticators explained a larger proportion of the time-to-first-recurrence (3.1Â %) and time-to-progression (5.4Â %) phenotypic variances than SNPs (1 and 0.01Â %, respectively). Adding SNPs to the clinico-pathological-parameters model slightly improved the prediction of time-to-first-recurrence (up to 4Â %). The prediction of time-to-progression using both clinico-pathological prognosticators and SNP did not improve. Heritability (Ä¥2) of both outcomes was <1Â % in NMIBC.ConclusionsWe adapted a Bayesian statistical learning method to deal with a large number of parameters in prognostic studies. Common SNPs showed a limited role in predicting NMIBC outcomes yielding a very low heritability for both outcomes. We report for the first time a heritability estimate for a disease outcome. Our method can be extended to other disease models.",2016,BMC Cancer
Semi-Smooth Second-order Type Methods for Composite Convex Programs,"The goal of this paper is to study approaches to bridge the gap between first-order and second-order type methods for composite convex programs. Our key observations are: i) Many well-known operator splitting methods, such as forward-backward splitting (FBS) and Douglas-Rachford splitting (DRS), actually define a possibly semi-smooth and monotone fixed-point mapping; ii) The optimal solutions of the composite convex program and the solutions of the system of nonlinear equations derived from the fixed-point mapping are equivalent. Solving the system of nonlinear equations rediscovers a paradigm on developing second-order methods. Although these fixed-point mappings may not be differentiable, they are often semi-smooth and its generalized Jacobian matrix is positive semidefinite due to monotonicity. By combining a regularization approach and a known hyperplane projection technique, we propose an adaptive semi-smooth Newton method and establish its convergence to global optimality. A semi-smooth Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) method in terms of handling the nonlinear least squares formulation is further presented. In practice, the second-order methods can be activated until the first-order type methods reach a good neighborhood of the global optimal solution. Preliminary numerical results on Lasso regression, logistic regression, basis pursuit, linear programming and quadratic programming demonstrate that our second-order type algorithms are able to achieve quadratic or superlinear convergence as long as the fixed-point residual of the initial point is small enough.",2016,arXiv: Optimization and Control
Hydrotherapeutic institutions in the Austro-Hungarian health resort Abbazia / Opatija owned by the South Railways Company.,"The South Railways Company built two hydrotherapeutic institutions Warm baths (Warmbade-Pavillion) and Hydrotherapeutic Institution (Hydropatische Anstalt) in the Angiolina Park in Opatija in 1884.

Manipulating the gut microbiota to combat alcoholic hepatitis,"Nature reviews | GastroenteroloGy & HepatoloGy Alcoholic hepatitis is a severe and lifethreatening form of alcoholassociated liver disease (ALD), but few effective therapies are available. Now, new research pinpoints the gut microbiota as an important therapeutic target for ALD, identifying Enterococcus faecalis and the exotoxin that it secretes, cytolysin, as important factors in the development and progression of ALD. Moreover, precise targeting of cytolysinpositive (cytolytic) E. faecalis with bacteriophage treatment attenuated ALD in a mouse model, and could be a promising novel therapeutic approach for patients with ALD. â€œThe number of people with chronic liver disease is increasing rapidly in Western countries,â€ explains author Bernd Schnabl. â€œLiver cirrhosis (endstage organ disease) is the twelfth leading cause of mortality worldwide; approximately half of these deaths are due to alcohol use disorder,â€ he adds. A link between the gut microbiota and ALD across the spectrum of disease (from alcoholic fatty liver to alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis) had already been demonstrated, but the underlying mechanisms and precise role of microorganisms were unknown. Previous work had shown that ALD could be transferred via faecal microbiota transplantation from patients with alcoholic hepatitis in germfree mice, and so Schnabl and colleagues wanted to investigate the bacteria and toxins responsible for this transmissible phenotype and their role in ALD development. First, the investigators examined the gut microbiota in different patient cohorts, and confirmed that chronic alcohol use (n = 44) and alcoholic hepatitis (n = 88) were associated with alterations in the composition of the faecal microbiota compared with individuals without alcoholuse disorders as controls (n = 26). One notable difference was the increased proportion of Enterococcus spp. in patients with alcoholic hepatitis (accounting for 5.59% of faecal bacteria versus almost none identified in faecal bacteria from controls). Moreover, faecal samples from patients with alcoholic hepatitis had ~2,700-fold more E. faecalis than controls, with ~80% of patients with alcoholic hepatitis positive for E. faecalis in faeces. Importantly, the presence of cytolytic E. faecalis correlated with both the severity of liver disease and with mortality in these patients; most cytolysinpositive patients with alcoholic hepatitis (89%) died within 180 days of admission. Next, the researchers used mouse models of ALD to demonstrate that cytolysin directly promoted disease development. Importantly, cytolysin directly induced hepatocyte death in vitro, and promoted liver injury in the context of ethanolinduced liver disease (chronicbinge ethanol diet) in mice. Mice colonized with cytolytic E. faecalis and then fed ethanol had more severe liver injury and increased hepatic steatosis than controls. The same trend in ALD severity was observed in germfree mice that received faecal transplants from cytolysinpositive patients with alcoholic hepatitis. Finally, the researchers developed a novel therapeutic approach using bacteriophages to target cytolytic E. faecalis specifically. In a humanized mouse model of ALD, bacteriophage treatment decreased cytolysin in the liver and abolished ethanolinduced liver injury and steatosis. â€œThis novel bacteriophage approach might be developed to alter the intestinal microbiomes of and treat patients with alcoholic hepatitis,â€ says Schnabl. â€œPhage therapy offers the opportunity to very precisely edit the gut microbiota and selectively target specific, toxin-producing bacterial strains.â€ The researchers call for more studies to validate their findings. â€œAn independent cohort of patients with alcoholic hepatitis is required to validate the human relevance of our findings and to test cytolysin as a predictive biomarker,â€ notes Schnabl, adding that a phase I clinical safety study using bacteriophage therapy in patients with alcoholic hepatitis is necessary to move forwards to the clinic.

Bed utilisation and increased risk of Clostridium difficile infections in acute hospitals in England in 2013/2014,"Background The study aimed to identify thresholds for hospital bed utilisation which are independently associated with significantly higher risks for Clostridium difficile infections (CDI) in acute hospitals in England. Method A retrospective analysis was carried out on reported data from the English National Health Service (NHS) for the financial year 2013/2014. Reported rates of CDI were used as a proxy for hospital infection rates in acute NHS hospital trusts. Multivariate linear regression was used to assess the relationship between bed utilisation values and CDI controlling for confounding factors. Hospitals were finally plotted in a Pabon Lasso graph according to their average bed occupancy rate (BOR) and bed turnover rate (BTR) per year to visualise the relationship between bed utilisation and CDI. Results Among English hospital NHS trusts, increasing BTR and decreasing BOR were associated with a decrease in CDI. However, this effect was not large, and patient mix had a larger impact on CDI rates than bed utilisation. Conclusions While policymakers and managers wishing to target healthcare providers with high CDI rates should look at bed utilisation measures, focusing on these alone is unlikely to have the desired impact. Instead, strategies to combat CDI must take a wider perspective on contributory factors at the institutional level.",2017,BMJ Quality & Safety in Health Care

Prediction and association mapping of agronomic traits in maize using multiple omic data,"Genomic selection holds a great promise to accelerate plant breeding via early selection before phenotypes are measured, and it offers major advantages over marker-assisted selection for highly polygenic traits. In addition to genomic data, metabolome and transcriptome are increasingly receiving attention as new data sources for phenotype prediction. We used data available from maize as a model to compare the predictive abilities of three different omic data sources using eight representative methods for six traits. We found that the best linear unbiased prediction overall performs better than other methods across different traits and different omic data, and genomic prediction performs better than transcriptomic and metabolomic predictions. For the same maize data, we also conducted genome-wide association study, transcriptome-wide association studies and metabolome-wide association studies for the six agronomic traits using both the genome-wide efficient mixed model association (GEMMA) method and a modified least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method. The new LASSO method has the ability to perform statistical tests.

Zika Virus: Infectious Process and Public Health Response,"The Zika virus has become a growing concern as a global pandemic. Since being identified in Uganda in 1947, the virus has spread around the world, recently emerging in South America with a great impact on Brazil. As of 2016, Zika has made its appearance in the United States and is now actively being transmitted in Florida. The virus is a mosquitovectored flavivirus primarily transmitted by the Aedes mosquito which infects a human through biting. Transmission through sexual intercourse is also possible as well as transmission from a pregnant woman to her fetus. This latter form of transmission presents the primary problem with the Zika virus; transmission to the fetus can cause microcephaly as well as other brain and developmental problems. Proper precautions should be taken based on these identified modes of transmission. Symptoms of Zika are similar to flu-like symptoms, such as low-grade fever, muscle pain and headache. About 20 percent of patients that come in contact with the Zika virus will originally present as asymptomatic and will not display symptoms until almost two weeks after initial contact with the virus. Zika virus can remain in the blood for about a week, but can remain in the semen for months. There are a number of methods used to detect the Zika virusurine, blood or semen samples may be used to assess if a patient is infected. Key Terms Aedes; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.); Diagnostic Tests; Fetus; Flavivirus; Florida; Microcephaly; Public Health; Sexual Partners; Vaccines; Zika Virus Introduction The Zika virus was originally identified in Uganda in 194 7. It has since spread around the world as two main strains, Asian and African, distinguishable by detailed analysis of the ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequence.1 This difference in sequence relates to a variation in availability for potential glycosylation sites in the virus. The Asian strain is responsible for the outbreaks seen in Brazil and the United States, after travelling through Pacific Island countries such as Malaysia (1969), Philippines (2012) and Easter Island (2014). In late 2014 and early 2015, reports to the Brazilian Ministry of Health of an ""acute exanthematic disease"" began following the 2014 Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) World Cup, and, in March 2015, the Zika virus was isolated in patients in various regions of BraziJ.2 By May, the Brazilian Ministry of Health recognized local transmission of the Zika virus. In September, reports of microcephaly began to surface, and on Oct. 23, 2015, the Brazilian Ministry of Health reported the occurrences to the World Health Organization. As the link between Zika virus and microcephaly became more apparent, the Brazilian Ministry of Health published guidelines for the management of microcephaly. There were an estimated 440,000 to 1,300,000 cases of Zika in Brazil in 2015 alone, and 508 cases of microcephaly were confirmed by February 2016. As of 2016, reports of Zika virus spread to the United States, significantly increasing awareness of the disease. On Jan. 15, 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a health alert warning travelers and health care providers to be vigilant for the signs and symptoms of the Zika virus as travel-associated cases had already been reported in travelers returning to the United States.3 Since then, there has been a rise in cases in the United States, most notably in California, Florida, New York and Texas, with 4,389 travelassociated cases reported as of Dec. 7, 2016.4 As of the same date, 185 locally acquired cases have been reported in the United States: 184 in Florida and one in Texas. The first reports of local transmission came in late July from Miami, Florida, where Zika virus was isolated in four patients, which was likely caused by local Aedes aegypti mosquito bites, as the patients had not recently traveled outside of the United States.5 Territories of the United States have also reported locally acquired cases: 32,848 cases in Puerto Rico, 57 cases in American Samoa and 807 cases in the Virgin Islands. 2 THE PHARMACY AND WELLNESS REVIEW Winter 2017 Volume 8, Issue 1 Zika Virus: Infectious Process and Public Health Response Infectious Disease Health care professionals and researchers have worked to gather as much information about the disease as possible, in order to inform the public about proper precautions.6 In addition, possible treatments and vaccines are currently in development. New information about the Zika virus is constantly being discovered, and the imperative task of keeping the public informed has become an emerging role of health care professionals. Etiology and Transmission The Zika virus is a mosquito-vectored flavivirus which uses several mechanisms to alter host cellular pathways to favor viral replication.7 Transmission of the Zika virus can occur through several mechanisms: receiving a bite from an infected mosquito, vertical transmission from mother to child and transmission through sexual activity.6 Less commonly, the Zika virus may be transmitted via blood transfusion or through laboratory exposure, though these are typically not a concern in the general population. There have not been any confirmed cases of transmission via blood transfusion in the United States, though there have been cases reported in Brazil. Additionally, the virus has been identified in blood donors in French Polynesia during several outbreaks. In one case study, spread of the virus through sweat and tears was also identified as a possible route oftransmission.s Transmission through the bite of a mosquito is the primary mode of transmission associated with the Zika virus. 6 Mosquitos of the Aedes genus may be infected with the virus, specifically the Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus species. These species of mosquito are primary reservoirs for the virus and can transmit other tropical diseases such as dengue fever and chikungunya. An infected mosquito can transmit the virus to a human through a bite. Likewise, a mosquito may also become infected after biting a human infected with the Zika virus. In turn, the newly infected mosquito may spread the virus to any other human it bites. These mosquitos are aggressive daytime biters, though biting, and therefore transmission, is also possible at night. Studies have been conducted that demonstrate vertical transmission as a possible mechanism of survival of the Zika virus in the Aedes aegypti mosquito.9 This is important when considering environments that act as potential breeding grounds for mosquitos. For instance, the Aedes mosquito often lays eggs in standing water. 6 This potential form of vertical transmission within the viral reservoir may attribute to disease survival. Vertical transmission in this manner is certainly possible in tropical climates which the mosquitos currently inhabit and may also be a concern in adverse conditions such as colder climates. 9 The mosquitos may lay eggs that will hatch once the environment becomes favorable.9,10 The Aedes mosquitos typically exist in tropical climates, but their range has extended to include the southern United States, possibly allowing for local transmission in this area.6 If a pregnant female becomes infected, she can pass the Zika virus to her fetus.6 Transmission may occur in utero or near the time of birth and may result in a wide range of health problems for the child. These could include microcephaly, decreased brain tissue, restricted joints, increased muscle tone or damage to the eyes. The Zika virus has been identified in breast milk; however, to date, there have not been any infections associated with breastfeeding. The proven benefits of breast milk currently outweigh the potential risk of Zika virus. Therefore, the CDC is still recommending breastfeeding in areas where the virus is prevalent. An individual may also transmit the Zika virus to any sexual partners.6 Sexual transmission can occur before, during or after the infected individual develops symptoms. It has also been hypothesized that an asymptomatic carrier can still transmit the Zika virus to a sexual partner. The Zika virus has been identified in the semen for up to six months after the dissipation of symptoms, much longer than in the blood, urine and vaginal fluids. For this reason, the CDC is currently recommending the use of condoms for at least six months after a man has returned from an area where Zika virus is endemic or six months after he has received a positive diagnosis of Zika. Signs, Symptoms and Diagnosis The Zika virus can manifest itself in many ways once it infects a host. A majority of those infected are asymptomatic or display mild symptoms such as low-grade fever, joint pain, maculopapular rash, arthralgia, nonpurulent conjunctivitis, headaches and myalgia.11,12 Approximately one in five patients initially asymptomatic will develop symptoms as late as 12 days after infection. In the asymptomatic population without detectable symptoms, the Zika virus can still be transmitted via blood primarily through blood transfusion and sexual intercourse.13 Typically, the Zika virus remains in the blood of an infected individual for about a week, but can remain in other fluids, such as semen, for much longer. If an individual suspects that he or she is infected with the Zika virus by displaying any of the above symptoms, he or she should immediately see their primary health care provider.12 A number of factors should be examined in order to give an accurate diagnosis. Factors such as the patient's travel history, symptoms and test results should be examined to determine if the patient is infected with Zika.14 Available diagnostic tests include a blood (serum) test and a urine test, which are used to confirm the presence of the Zika virus in an individuaJ.12 Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests are utilized to determine if a urine specimen is positive for Zika virus.

Bank Credit Risk Networks: Evidence from the Eurozone Crisis,The European nancial crisis has shown that the credit risk of large nancial institutions is highly interconnected as a results of a number of linkages between entities like exposure to common assets and interbank lending. In this work we propose a novel methodology to study credit risk interdependence in large panels of nancial institutions. We introduce a credit risk model in which bank defaults can be triggered both by systematic economy wide and idiosyncratic bank specic shocks. The idiosyncratic shocks are assumed to have a sparse conditional dependence structure that we call the bank credit risk network. An estimation strategy based on CDS data and Lasso-type regression allows to estimate the parameters of the model and to recover the bank credit risk network structure. We apply this technique to analyse the interdependence of large European nancial institutions between 2006 and 2013. Results show that the credit risk network captures a substantial amount of dependence on top of what can be explained by systematic,2014,
Comparative Study of Regression Techniques in the Estimation of UPDRS Score for Parkinsonâ€™s disease,"Studies have shown that instances of Parkinsonâ€™s disease have been on the rise over the past 30 years. A metric that measures the extremity of Parkinsonâ€™s disease in a person is their Unified Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) score. Thus, an algorithm that can predict the UPDRS score of a Parkinsonâ€™s patient will be effective in determining the severity of the patientâ€™s condition. This paper aims to forecast a patientâ€™s UPDRS score by inferring patterns from historical figures and other independent parameter values that affect the patientsâ€™ UPDRS score. Four regression techniques namely multilinear, ridge, robust and LASSO regression are being used to predict the UPDRS scores. This will be done using the R language and through the use of the MASS, glmnet packages.",2018,International journal of engineering and technology
"Historisieren und/oder Ã¼berwinden? Foucault im Kontext ""Neuer Materialismen""","In the course of recent calls for a new materialist or realist turn in the humanities, Foucault's contributions to our thinking of the present have come under scrutiny. Has Foucault paved the way for new approaches capable to grasp the complex materiality of our time? Or is he rather part of the anthropocentric baggage we need to leave behind, lulled into the 'Kantian sleep' that has worn out thinking for way too long? After sketching some critical points raised against Foucault, thereby focusing on Quentin Meillassoux, the author discusses the possible philosophical roots of Foucault's alleged anthropocentrism. The paper ends by re-examining what it would mean to historicize or even overcome Foucault in favor of a new materialism .",2015,
Automatic Scoring of Multiple Semantic Attributes With Multi-Task Feature Leverage: A Study on Pulmonary Nodules in CT Images.,"The gap between the computational and semantic features is the one of major factors that bottlenecks the computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) performance from clinical usage. To bridge this gap, we exploit three multi-task learning (MTL) schemes to leverage heterogeneous computational features derived from deep learning models of stacked denoising autoencoder (SDAE) and convolutional neural network (CNN), as well as hand-crafted Haar-like and HoG features, for the description of 9 semantic features for lung nodules in CT images. We regard that there may exist relations among the semantic features of ""spiculation"", ""texture"", ""margin"", etc., that can be explored with the MTL. The Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC) data is adopted in this study for the rich annotation resources. The LIDC nodules were quantitatively scored w.r.t. 9 semantic features from 12 radiologists of several institutes in U.S.A. By treating each semantic feature as an individual task, the MTL schemes select and map the heterogeneous computational features toward the radiologists' ratings with cross validation evaluation schemes on the randomly selected 2400 nodules from the LIDC dataset. The experimental results suggest that the predicted semantic scores from the three MTL schemes are closer to the radiologists' ratings than the scores from single-task LASSO and elastic net regression methods. The proposed semantic attribute scoring scheme may provide richer quantitative assessments of nodules for better support of diagnostic decision and management. Meanwhile, the capability of the automatic association of medical image contents with the clinical semantic terms by our method may also assist the development of medical search engine.",2017,IEEE transactions on medical imaging
Advances in Brain-Inspired Cognitive Systems,"This special issue focuses on recent advancements in the field of brain-inspired cognitive systems. It comprises 18 articles which are carefully selected, significantly revised versions of papers presented at the seventh International Conference on Brain-Inspired Cognitive Systems (BICS 2015) held at Hefei, China, on December 11â€“13, 2015. The aim of BICS 2015 was to bring together leading scientists, engineers, and educators who use analytic, syntactic, and computational methods both to understand the prodigious processing properties of biological systems and, specifically, of the brain, and to exploit such knowledge to advance computational methods toward higher levels of cognitive competence. The conference featured plenary speeches given by renowned scholars and a range of technical sessions focusing on timely topics of interest to the scientific community. Based on the recommendation of symposium organizers and reviewers, a number of authors were invited to submit revised versions of their contributions to this special issue. All articles went through a rigorous review procedure involving at least three independent experts before being accepted for publication. Chen et al. propose an efficient algorithm for actionbased pedestrian identification using hierarchical matching pursuit and order-preserving sparse coding to identify and classify features. Gepperth et al. present a novel system for performing multi-sensor fusion with experience-based learning. The authors demonstrate that near-optimal fusion can be learned and is a resource-efficient alternative to empirical estimation of joint probability distributions and Bayesian inference. They also show that their generative learning approach outperforms Bayesian optimum as it is capable of rejecting outliers through detection of systematic changes in input statistics. Mi et al. describe a novel system for occluded face recognition. They propose a new similarity matrix called â€˜averaged degree of aggregation of matched pixelsâ€™ and show that their system is very robust against occlusion and competitive in terms of recognition accuracy and computation time. Jiang et al. present a cognitively distributed simultaneous localization and tracking algorithm, with applications in Gaussian distributed wireless sensor networks, based on adaptive distributed filtering for target tracking and sensor localization. Their proposed system shows higher accuracy in parameter estimation, coupled with low computational complexity. Zhao et al. propose a new method called â€˜elastic matchingâ€™ for common visual pattern discovery, through inducing sparse solutions and conducting detection more robustly. Zhang et al. describe a discriminative Lasso in which sparsity and correlation are jointly considered. The method & Amir Hussain ahu@cs.stir.ac.uk",2016,Cognitive Computation
Transparencia y vacÃ­o. La intersecciÃ³n con la ciudad en la vivienda de lujo,"La importancia de la vivienda colectiva acomodada o â€œde lujoâ€ en la configuracion urbana es indudable. En 
Madrid, especialmente en las zonas del centro y de los ensanches, es uno de los tipos basicos, existiendo 
algunos barrios como Salamanca o Chamberi en los cuales constituye la tipologia mayoritaria. Sin embargo, se 
trata de un tema historicamente alejado del debate arquitectonico. 
El analisis de este tipo de viviendas ofrece diversas lecturas, que abarcan desde aspectos especificos del 
proyecto arquitectonico a otros relacionados con el patrimonio, la sostenibilidad o la construccion. Una de las 
lecturas mas interesantes y al tiempo poco estudiadas es la que aborda la interseccion de los bloques con la 
ciudad: los portales de los edificios. Elemento intermedio, el portal cumple en este tipo de viviendas una funcion 
utilitaria que es tambien simbolica. 
Frente a la obsesion por la seguridad propia de nuestros dias y la indiferencia, desprecio o temor hacia la ciudad 
industrial manifestada por las clases altas de la sociedad de principios de siglo, las propuestas de cinco 
arquitectos modernos, Julio Cano Lasso, Javier Carvajal, Antonio Lamela, Francesc Mitjans y Juan Manuel Ruiz 
de la Prada representan una via alternativa capaz de garantizar requerimientos divergentes como privacidad y 
representacion. 
Evitando los excesos resultado de un exhaustivo aprovechamiento inmobiliario pero sin caer en 
irresponsabilidades artisticas, los arquitectos mencionados fueron capaces de plantear en los espacios comunes 
de sus edificios de viviendas colectivas de lujo un atinado balance entre lo publico y lo privado, un punto 
intermedio entre la casa y la ciudad.

SMPFRAME : A Distributed Framework for Scheduled Model Parallel Machine Learning,"Machine learning (ML) problems commonly applied to big data by existing distributed systems share and update all ML model parameters at each machine using a partition of data â€” a strategy known as data-parallel. An alternative and complimentary strategy, model-parallel, partitions model parameters for non-shared parallel access and update, periodically repartitioning to facilitate communication. Model-parallelism is motivated by two challenges that data-parallelism does not usually address: (1) parameters may be dependent, thus naive concurrent updates can introduce errors that slow convergence or even cause algorithm failure; (2) model parameters converge at different rates, thus a small subset of parameters can bottleneck ML algorithm completion. We propose scheduled model parallellism (SMP), a programming approach where selection of parameters to be updated (the schedule) is explicitly separated from parameter update logic. The schedule can improve ML algorithm convergence speed by planning for parameter dependencies and uneven convergence. To support SMP at scale, we develop an archetype software framework SMPFRAME which optimizes the throughput of SMP programs, and benchmark four common ML applications written as SMP programs: LDA topic modeling, matrix factorization, sparse least-squares (Lasso) regression and sparse logistic regression. By improving ML progress per iteration through SMP programming whilst improving iteration throughput through SMPFRAME we show that SMP programs running on SMPFRAME outperform non-model-parallel ML implementations: for example, SMP LDA and SMP Lasso respectively achieve 10x and 5x faster convergence than recent, well-established baselines.",2015,
Prediction of major international soccer tournaments based on team-specific regularized Poisson regression: An application to the FIFA World Cup 2014,"Abstract In this article an approach for the analysis and prediction of international soccer match results is proposed. It is based on a regularized Poisson regression model that includes various potentially influential covariates describing the national teamsâ€™ success in previous FIFA World Cups. Additionally, within the generalized linear model (GLM) framework, also differences of team-specific effects are incorporated. In order to achieve variable selection and shrinkage, we use tailored Lasso approaches. Based on preceding FIFA World Cups, two models for the prediction of the FIFA World Cup 2014 are fitted and investigated. Based on the model estimates, the FIFA World Cup 2014 is simulated repeatedly and winning probabilities are obtained for all teams. Both models favor the actual FIFA World Champion Germany.",2015,Journal of Quantitative Analysis in Sports
