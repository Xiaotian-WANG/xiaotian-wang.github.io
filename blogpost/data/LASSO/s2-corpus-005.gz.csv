Learning and Estimation Applications of an Online Homotopy Algorithm for a Generalization of the Lasso,"The LASSO is a widely used shrinkage and selection method for linear regression. We propose a generalization of the LASSO in which the $l_1$ penalty is applied on a linear transformation of the regression parameters, allowing to input prior information on the structure of the problem and to improve interpretability of the results. We also study time varying system with an $l_1$-penalty on the variations of the state, leading to estimates that exhibit few ``jumps''. We propose a homotopy algorithm that updates the solution as additional measurements are available. The algorithm takes advantage of the sparsity of the solution for computational efficiency and is promising for mining large datasets. The algorithm is implemented on three experimental data sets representing applications to traffic estimation from sparsely sampled probe vehicles, flow estimation in tidal channels and text analysis of on-line news.",2013,Discrete and Continuous Dynamical Systems - Series S
Texture Analysis of Breast DCE-MRI Based on Intratumoral Subregions for Predicting HER2 2+ Status,"Background: Breast tumor heterogeneity is related to risk factors that lead to aggressive tumor growth; however, such heterogeneity has not been thoroughly investigated. Purpose: To evaluate the performance of texture features extracted from heterogeneity subregions on subtraction MRI images for identifying human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) 2+ status of breast cancers. Materials and Methods: Seventy-six patients with HER2 2+ breast cancer who underwent dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging were enrolled, including 42 HER2 positive and 34 negative cases confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The lesion area was delineated semi-automatically on the subtraction MRI images at the second, fourth, and sixth phases (P-1, P-2, and P-3). A regionalization method was used to segment the lesion area into three subregions (rapid, medium, and slow) according to peak arrival time of the contrast agent. We extracted 488 texture features from the whole lesion area and three subregions independently. Wrapper, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and stepwise methods were used to identify the optimal feature subsets. Univariate analysis was performed as well as support vector machine (SVM) with a leave-one-out-based cross-validation method. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated to evaluate the performance of the classifiers. Results: In univariate analysis, the variance from medium subregion at P-2 was the best-performing feature for distinguishing HER2 2+ status (AUC = 0.836); for the whole lesion region, the variance at P-2 achieved the best performance (AUC = 0.798). There was no significant difference between the two methods (P = 0.271). In the machine learning with SVM, the best performance (AUC = 0.929) was achieved with LASSO from rapid subregion at P-2; for the whole region, the highest AUC value was 0.847 obtained at P-2 with LASSO. The difference was significant between the two methods (P = 0.021). Conclusion: The texture analysis of heterogeneity subregions based on intratumoral regionalization method showed potential value for recognizing HER2 2+ status in breast cancer.",2020,

Ensembles of Regularized Linear Models,"We propose an approach for building ensembles of regularized linear models by optimizing a novel objective function, that encourages sparsity within each model and diversity among them. Our procedure works on top of a given penalized linear regression estimator (e.g., Lasso, Elastic Net, SCAD) by fitting it to possibly overlapping subsets of features, while at the same time encouraging diversity among the subsets, to reduce the correlation between the predictions that result from each fitted model. The predictions from the models are then aggregated. For the case of an Elastic Net penalty and orthogonal predictors, we give a closed form solution for the regression coefficients in each of the ensembled models. An extensive simulation study and real-data applications show that the proposed method systematically improves the prediction accuracy of the base linear estimators being ensembled. Extensions to GLMs and other models are discussed.",2017,
Structural determinants of health among women who started selling sex as minors in Burkina Faso.,"OBJECTIVES
To explore the prevalence of and factors associated with initiation of selling sex as a minor.


DESIGN
Data were drawn from cross-sectional studies of adult female sex workers (FSW) recruited through respondent-driven sampling in Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso.


METHODS
FSW completed a questionnaire that included a retrospective question regarding the age at which they started selling sex. Separate multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted for each city to examine associations with initiation of selling sex as a minor (<18 year old), controlling for current age.


RESULTS
Of study participants, 27.8% (194/698) reported selling sex as a minor, ranging from 24.4% (85/349) in Bobo-Dioulasso to 31.2% (85/349) in Ouagadougou. In Ouagadougou, early initiates were more than twice as likely to report someone ever forced them to have sex [age-adjusted odds ratio (aaOR): 2.54, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.53 to 4.23]. In Bobo-Dioulasso, those who started as minors were more likely to report someone ever tortured them (aaOR: 2.29, 95% CI: 1.28 to 4.10). In both cities, early initiates were more likely to not use a condom with a client if offered more money (Ouagadougou aaOR: 2.34, 95% CI: 1.23 to 4.47; Bobo-Dioulasso aaOR: 2.37, 95% CI: 1.29 to 4.36). In Ouagadougou, women who had started selling sex at a young age were half as likely to have been tested for HIV more than once ever (aaOR: 0.50, 95% CI: 0.26 to 0.94). In Bobo-Dioulasso, early initiates were less likely to attend HIV-related talks or meetings (aaOR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.33 to 0.97).


CONCLUSIONS
A substantial proportion of FSW in Burkina Faso started selling sex as minors. The findings show that there are heightened vulnerabilities associated with selling sex below age 18 years, including physical and sexual violence, client-related barriers to condom use, and lower access to HIV-related services.",2015,Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes

"ErnÃ¤hrung von sozial benachteiligten Menschen am Beispiel von Tafelkunden : Betrachtung des ErnÃ¤hrungs- und Gesundheitsverhaltens, der Verbreitung von ErnÃ¤hrungsarmut und des Obst- und GemÃ¼sekonsums","In industrialisierten Landern folgt die Verteilung der Mortalitat und Morbiditat einem sozialen Gradienten. Damit einhergehend weisen Personen mit einem niedrigen soziookonomischen Status (SES) eine ungesundere Ernahrung auf und konsumieren weniger Obst und Gemuse (OG) als Personen mit einem hoheren SES. Eine besonders gefahrdete Personengruppe sind sozial benachteiligte Menschen wie zum Beispiel Tafelkunden (TK). Unter diesen ist Ernahrungsarmut (EA) stark verbreitet. Tafeln existieren weltweit und verteilen Lebensmittel, die u.a. von Lebensmittelhandlern gespendet werden, an sozial benachteiligte Menschen. Allein in Deutschland werden etwa 1.5 Millionen Menschen von uber 900 Tafeln mit uberwiegend frischem OG versorgt. In Deutschland ist aber sehr wenig uber die Ernahrung von TK bekannt. Damit ergaben sich fur diese Arbeit folgende Fragestellungen: 
1. Unterscheiden sich TK aus verschiedenen Stadten in ihrem Gesundheitszustand und Ernahrungsverhalten untereinander und von der deutschen Bevolkerung mit einem niedrigen SES (2. Kapitel, erste Publikation)? 
2. Wie verbreitet ist EA unter TK und welche soziodemographischen, gesundheitlichen und tafelassoziierten Variablen korrelieren mit EA (3. Kapitel, zweite Publikation)? 
3. Unterscheiden sich mannliche TK von tafelnutzungsberechtigten mannlichen nicht-TK in ihrem OG-Konsum und kann der OG Konsum von sozial schwachen Mannern durch eine wochentliche kostenlose Bereitstellung (14 Portionen/ pro Woche) von selbstgewahlten OG uber einen Zeitraum von vier Wochen erhoht werden (4. Kapitel, dritte Publikation)? 
Fur die Publikationen dieser Arbeit wurden Daten zur Soziodemographie, zum Gesundheits- und Ernahrungsverhalten sowie zu EA in verschiedenen Stadten erhoben. Die Fragen fur die dabei verwendeten Fragebogen stammen aus den Erhebungsinstrumenten der nationalen Befragungen DEGS (Studie zur Gesundheit Erwachsener in Deutschland) und GEDA (Gesundheit in Deutschland aktuell) und der FIES (Food Insecurity and Experience Scale), wurden aber an die Zielgruppe adaptiert. Allen Publikationen liegt ein Querschnittstudiendesign zugrunde. In der dritten Publikation wurde auserdem fur den zweiten Teil der Fragestellung eine Interventionsstudie im Langsschnittstudiendesign durchgefuhrt. 
Die erste Publikation zeigt, dass es sich bei TK an den drei untersuchten Standorten (Berlin n=94, Ludwigsburg n=64, Fulda n=114) um keine homogene Gruppe handelt. TK schatzen TK ihre Gesundheit vermehrt schlechter ein (Anteil subjektive Einschatzung der Gesundheit als moderat, schlecht oder sehr schlecht: Manner 67.4% vs. 43.5%, Frauen 68.8% vs. 36.7%) im Vergleich zu der deutschen Bevolkerung mit einem niedrigen SES. Auserdem konsumieren weniger TK taglich Obst (Anteil taglicher Obstkonsum: Manner 39.8% vs. 43.5%, Frauen 56.2% vs. 62.4%). Die zweite Publikation offenbart mit 70.2% die weite Verbreitung von EA unter TK (Stuttgart n=510, Karlsruhe n=186, Berlin n=337). Insbesondere die Variablen Alter (r Ï„ = -0.224, p<0.000) und Rauchen (V=0.219, p<0.000) sind stark mit EA assoziiert. Die dritte Publikation verdeutlicht, dass sich mannliche TK (n=24) von tafelnutzungsberechtigten mannlichen nicht-TK (n=28) aus Stuttgart bezuglich der konsumierten OG-Menge (2.2 Portionen/Tag vs. 1.8 Portionen/Tag) und der OG-Sortenvielfalt (17 Sorten/Monat vs. 14.4 Sorten/Monat) nicht signifikant unterscheiden. Weiterhin wird aus der dritten Publikation ersichtlich, dass die wochentliche kostenlose Bereitstellung von OG uber einen Zeitraum von vier Wochen (14 Portionen/Woche) in der Interventionsgruppe (n=25) im Vergleich zur Kontrollgruppe (n=27) signifikant sowohl zu einer hoheren konsumierten OG-Menge (DifferenzIG 1.1 Portionen/Tag vs. DifferenzKG -0.2 Portionen/Tag) als auch zu einer Steigerung der Sortenvielfalt (DifferenzIG 2.6 Sorten/Monat vs. DifferenzKG -1.2 Sorten/Monat) fuhrt. Auffallig ist der hohe Anteil an Rauchern unter TK, sowohl in der ersten (46.9%) als auch in der dritten Publikation (66.7%). Die genannten Ergebnisse decken sich mit den Forschungsergebnissen aus dem Ausland. 
Die Aussagen der Publikationen sind durch methodische Einschrankungen der Standardisierung und Reprasentativitat (erste und zweite Publikation) sowie durch das Querschnittstudiendesign (erste und zweite Publikation sowie erste Fragestellung der dritten Publikation) limitiert. 
Zusammenfassend lasst sich schlussfolgern, dass Tafeln eine geeignete Moglichkeit darstellen, um sozial benachteiligte Menschen zu erreichen, aber auch, um deren Ernahrungs- und Gesundheitsverhalten sowie Interventionsmoglichkeiten zu erforschen. Das Ausmas der gesundheitlichen Ungleichheit wird vermutlich unterschatzt. EA ist unter TK stark verbreitet und Rauchen als Armutsfaktor unter TK sollte weiter erforscht werden. Die kostenlose Bereitstellung von OG scheint eine geeignete Moglichkeit zu sein, um den Konsum und die Sortenvielfalt von OG unter sozial benachteiligten Menschen zu erhohen. 
In industrialized countries the distribution of mortality of morbidity follows a social gradient. Hence, among people with a lower socioeconomic status (SES) the nutritional quality is poor and low fruit and vegetable consumption occur more frequently compared to people with a higher SES. A particularly vulnerable group are socially disadvantaged people such as food bank users. Food insecurity (FI) is also more common in this population group. Food banks exist worldwide and distribute donated groceries (e.g. from food retailers) to socially disadvantaged people. In Germany, 1.5 million users are supported by over 900 food banks providing mainly fresh fruits and vegetables (FV). In Germany, little is known about the diet of food bank users. The following research questions were developed for this thesis: 
1. Are there differences in health and nutrition status among people using food banks in different types of cities and can differences in these variables be found when comparing food bank users with the as low SES defined German population (chapter 2, first publication)? 
2. How widespread is FI among food bank users and which socio-demographic, food bank-related and health variables are associated with FI (chapter 3, second publication)? 
3. Are there differences in FV intake between male food bank users and male eligible non-food bank users and can FV intake among this study population be increased by an intervention providing weekly free and personally selected FV (14 portions/ per week) for four weeks (chapter 4, third publication)? 
For the publications of this thesis data of food bank users regarding socio-demographic, health- and nutrition-related variables were collected in different cities. The questions were taken from the questionnaire of the national study DEGS (German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Adults) and GEDA (German Health Update) and from the FIES (Food Insecurity and Experience Scale). Additionally, questionnaires were adapted to the study population. In all publications cross-sectional study designs were used. Except in the third publication for the second part of the research questions an intervention study using a longitudinal design was conducted. 
The first publication shows that food bank users from the three examined cities (Berlin n=94, Ludwigsburg n=64, Fulda n=114) are not a homogenous group. Food bank users assess their self-rated health mostly worse than people from the low SES German population (proportion self-rated health as moderate, bad or very bad: men 67.4% vs. 43.5%, women 68.8% vs. 36.7%). Additionally, they consume less fruit daily (proportion of daily fruit consumption: men 39.8% vs. 43.5%, women 56.2% vs. 62.4%). The second publication reveals with 70.2% a high rate of FI among food bank users (Stuttgart n=510, Karlsruhe n=186, Berlin n=337). Especially age (r Ï„ = -0.224, p<0.000) and smoking (V=0.219, p<0.000) are strongly associated with FI. The third publication clarifies that male food banks users (n=24) from Stuttgart did not differ in consumed FV amount (2.2 portions/day vs. 1.8 portions/day) and variety (17 types/month vs. 14.4 types/month) compared to non-food bank users (n=28). Besides, the weekly provision of free fruit and vegetables for four weeks (14 portions/ month) increases the consumed fruit and vegetable amount (difference-IG 1.1 portions/day vs. difference-CG -0.2 portions/day) and variety (difference-IG 2.6 types/month vs. difference-CG -1.2 types/month) among the intervention group (n=25) compared to the control group (n=27). It is important to note the high amount of smokers among food bank users both in the first (46.9%) and the third publication (66.7%). The reported results correspond to research from abroad. 
Results of the publications are limited by unbalanced standardization and representation procedures (first and second publication) and the cross-sectional design (first and second publication and first research question of the third publication). 
It can be concluded that food banks are a suitable option to target socially disadvantaged people and to explore their nutrition and health behavior as well as a suitable option to provide intervention opportunities. The extent of health inequality is probably underestimated. FI is widespread among food bank users and smoking as poverty factor among food bank users should be further examined. The free provision of fruit and vegetables seems to be an appropriate possibility to increase the consumption and variety of fruit and vegetables among socially disadvantaged people.",2018,
Sparse Approximations Of Protein Structure From Noisy Random Projections,"Single-particle electron microscopy is a modern technique that biophysicists employ to learn the structure of proteins. It yields data that consist of noisy random projections of the protein structure in random directions, with the added complication that the projection angles cannot be observed. In order to reconstruct a three-dimensional model, the projection directions need to be estimated by use of an ad-hoc starting estimate of the unknown particle. In this paper we propose a methodology that does not rely on knowledge of the projection angles, to construct an objective data-dependent low-resolution approximation of the unknown structure that can serve as such a starting estimate. The approach assumes that the protein admits a suitable sparse representation, and employs discrete L-1-regularization (LASSO) as well as notions from shape theory to tackle the peculiar challenges involved in the associated inverse problem. We illustrate the approach by application to the reconstruction of an E. coli protein component called the Klenow fragment.",2011,The Annals of Applied Statistics
The Shotgun Method 2.0 Estimating Population Numbers for Second-Century AD Sagalassos,"During the last 150 years archaeologists and historians attempted to estimate the population sizes of cities and regions in the past via the application of a large variety of formulae. Most of these formulae were, however, heavily criticised, or had to rely on guesstimates. In 2006, Mogens Herman Hansen presented the â€˜shotgun methodâ€™ as an alternative. Here, different calculation formulae were applied on the same context and the final result consisted of the total range of all the estimates. These ranges, however, are often too broad to make further inferences. Therefore, this paper aims â€” in the spirit of the â€˜shotgun methodâ€™ â€” at surveying the population estimates to come to distributions which make it possible to select a population range with a specific probability. This refined method makes it possible to calculate both the carrying capacity and the population of a specific region or city. Consequently, inferences can be made on the population pressure and relation between an urban centre and its territory. The ancient site of Sagalassos (SW Anatolia) during the second century AD is chosen as a case study to obtain an estimate for the urban and territorial population.",2018,Ancient Society
Mechanism of actin polymerization with yeast formin Bni1p: effect of the KCl concentration on the FH2 mediated actin nucleation,"Formin proteins are actin nucleators and elongators which can be found in most 
eukaryotic cells. In this work, structure-function relationships between yeast formin 
Bni1p and actin polymerization were studied. 
 
In the first part of this work, it was attempted to clone and express formin constructs 
derived from yeast Bni1p (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), including the key FH2 domain 
and a modified FH1 domain. Biomathematical models involving both diffusion and 
concentration-limited actin recruitment kinetics could be tested with such proteins. 
Cloning was mostly successful, but only the FH2 domain alone was expressed. 
 
In the second part of this work, a salt effect on FH2 mediated actin nucleation was 
discovered by means of pyrene assays and epifluorescence microscopy. Potassium 
chloride (KCl) is a downregulator of FH2 nucleation activity: a higher KCl 
concentration leads to a significantly lower actin polymerization speed (kp, m), to a 
bigger lag time (tlag) and to a bigger t1/2, with the respective actin filament length 
distributions. The salt effect was shown to be significant in a KCl concentration range 
from 10 mM to 90 mM at two different FH2 concentration, but not in absence of FH2. 
The critical KCl concentration is lowered in the presence of FH2. Some initial 
experiments with sodium chloride point to a non-specific nature of this salt. This is in 
agreement with the electrostatic nature of the salt effect, which was studied further 
by computational means: A decrease of the KCl concentration leads to lower binding 
free energies of the protein-protein interactions in the crystallographically 
characterized actin-FH2 complex 1Y64. This is especially the case for the electrostatic 
Coulomb interaction of a specific area (""lasso"" site). ANCHOR calculation results of 
solvent accessible surface areas (SASAs) corroborate the importance of this site. 
 
The experimentally found downregulation of FH2 
mediated actin nucleation by KCl can 
therefore be explained by reduced actin recruitment by the FH2 dimer: KCl diminishes 
the surface charge of FH2 and actin and thus weakens electrostatic Coulomb 
interactions. 
 
In future, this newly discovered salt effect should be considered in experiments on 
formins, for example when performing in vitro screens for FH2 inhibitors. The 
relevance of this new salt effect in vivo remains to be demonstrated.",2012,
Model Selection with Penalised Likelihood In a Multi-Dimensional Contingency Table,"In multi-dimensional contingency tables sparse data occur frequently. For example, with binary comorbidity data [1]; or genetic data, such as exons of spliced genes [2] or thresholded microarray data. We assume a log-linear model to analyse such tables, and use conditional Poisson likelihood (Birch, 1963), whence interactions between the variables measure dependence. In particular, we consider the class of hierarchical log-linear models. With sparse data, the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters may not exist (Agresti, 2002). Then, the natural focus is on low order interactions and we explore a multiple Lasso-based penalised likelihood approach, â€˜(Âµ), in this context. Like [2], we use penalised likelihood to analyse simulated contingency tables [1] in order to produce simpler hierarchical models. However, we extend the",2009,
Blade vibration study by spectral analysis of tip-timing signals with OMP algorithm,"Abstract Blades vibrations must be measured in operations to validate blade design. Tip-timing is one of the classical measurement methods but its main drawback is the generation of sub-sampled and non-uniform sampled signals. Consequently tip-timing signals cannot be processed with conventional methods. Assuming that blade vibration signals yield to line spectra, we introduced a sparse signal model that uses speed variation of the engine. The usual solutions of inverse problems are given with the LASSO method. This paper presents a new approach based on a l 0 -regularization. It is solved with the OMP algorithm adapted to our model. Results from synthetic and real signals are presented to illustrate the efficiency of this method, including a real blade crack test case. The main advantages of the proposed method are to provide accurate estimations with a computational cost drastically reduced with respect to existing methods. Besides, the method does not need to set up regularization parameters while taking into account the speed variation of the engines. Finally, results show that this approach greatly reduces frequency aliasings caused by the low sampling frequency of the measured signals.",2019,Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing
Scientists show how magnetic pulses change the brain in treatment for depressed patients: may open door to individualised treatment,"P.1.i.016 Fronto-insular network and prefrontal GABA levels following targeted transcranial thetaburst magnetic stimulation S.J. Iwabuchi1 Â°, D.P. Auer2, F. Raschke2, S. Lankappa3, L. Palaniyappan1 1The University of Nottingham, Division of Psychiatry and Applied Psychology, Nottingham, United Kingdom; 2The University of Nottingham, Division of Clinical Neuroscience, Nottingham, United Kingdom; 3Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust, Psychiatry, Nottingham, United Kingdom Background and Aims: Recent neuroimaging studies have identified the insula as a key brain region in the pathophysiology of depression and may be a crucial target for the treatment of depression [1]. The modulation of insular networks may have widespread effects on the connectivity of other disrupted networks, and ultimately reduce symptom burden in depression. In addition, patients with depression have also shown to have altered neurochemistry (e.g. glutamate and GABA) [2]. Neurostimulation approaches have demonstrated that modulation of both cortical connectivity [3] and neurochemistry [4] is possible, though the precise nature of these effects is uncertain. Using a connectivitybased approach, we sought proof of concept for the neuromodulation of the insula through transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and how these effects may be related to GABA changes in the frontal cortex. Our aim was to develop a connectivityinformed neuromodulation approach for TMS to reduce depressive symptom burden. To this end, we report a proof of concept study in healthy controls. Methods: In a sample of 27 healthy controls, we investigated the effects of intermittent theta-burst TMS (iTBS) on frontoinsular effective connectivity using resting-state functional MRI and Granger causal analysis (GCA). We also measured GABA levels in a voxel placed in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Images were acquired on a GE 3T MR750 scanner and preprocessed using standard procedures. For each subject, GCA was seeded from the right anterior insula (rAI) to locate the highest peak intensity within the left DLPFC, which was used as the neuronavigation target location for iTBS. We also ran an inverse GCA from each individualâ€™s DLPFC target region to the rAI to form a reciprocal fronto-insula network. The Granger coefficients were extracted from 6mm spherical regions of interest from both rAI and DLPFC target regions and compared between placebo and real iTBS. GABA (relative to creatine) levels were also compared between placebo and real iTBS and correlated with changes in Granger coefficients. Results: Results showed significant dampening of the putative negative influence of the DLPFC on the rAI following iTBS (p = 0.043). Levels of GABA were also significantly reduced following iTBS (p = 0.041). Furthermore, absolute changes in frontoinsular connectivity induced by iTBS were significantly correlated with absolute changes in GABA (p = 0.002). This suggests that iTBS has a direct effect on the effective connectivity between the DLPFC and rAI via an inhibitory mechanism on the influence of the DLPFC on the rAI, and this functional change may be mediated by changes in GABA levels in frontal regions. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that the application of a single session of targeted iTBS on the frontal cortex can modulate the effective connectivity of the rAI, a key target region in depression, and additionally produce changes in frontal GABA levels. Moreover, we showed that these changes were inter-related, suggesting that changes in both the fronto-insular circuitry and neurochemistry may underlie the therapeutic effects of iTBS. These findings raise the possibility of targeted Brain Network Modulation to optimise the outcomes of TMS treatment in patients with depression. References [1] Sliz, D., Hayley, S., 2012.

Adaptive LASSO for general transformation models with right censored data,"In this paper, we consider variable selection for general transformation models with right censored data and propose a unified procedure for both variable selection and estimation. We conduct the proposed procedure by maximizing penalized log-marginal likelihood function with Adaptive LASSO penalty (ALASSO) on regression coefficients. Two main advantages of this procedure are as follows: (i) the penalties can be assigned to regression coefficients adaptively by data according to the importance of corresponding covariates; (ii) it is free of baseline survival function and censoring distribution. Under some regular conditions, we show that the penalized estimates with ALASSO are n-consistent and enjoy oracle properties. Some simulation examples and Primary Biliary Cirrhosis Data application illustrate that our proposed procedure works very well for moderate sample size.",2012,Comput. Stat. Data Anal.
Une nouvelle endoprothÃ¨se branchÃ©e hypogastrique modifiÃ©e par le chirurgien pour prÃ©server la circulation pelvienne,"Introduction Nous decrivons la faisabilite et les resultats precoces dâ€™une nouvelle approche destinee a preserver la circulation pelvienne au cours du traitement endovasculaire des anevrysmes aortiques (EVAR) pour les patients presentant un anevrysme aorto-iliaque sâ€™etendant a la bifurcation iliaque. Methodes Trois patients a haut risque Ã¢ges de 70 Â± 7 ans, avec de larges anevrysmes aorto-iliaques (moyenne 6,7 Â± 0,5 cm) et presentant des zones de fixation iliaque commune inadequatesÂ etaient traites avec une endoprothese branchee hypogastrique modifiee par le chirurgien entre Juin 2007 et Juillet 2008. Lâ€™implant etait confectionne a partir dâ€™un jambage iliaque dâ€™endoprothese de 73 mm sur lequel etait cousue une branche prothetique laterale en polyesther de 6-8 mm. Lâ€™implant modifie etait remis en place dans une gaine 20 Fr, et la branche laterale etait pre-catheterisee a lâ€™aide dâ€™un guide et dâ€™un catheter. Lâ€™endoprothese remise ainsi dans sa gaine etait introduite au niveau de la bifurcation aortique a lâ€™aide dâ€™une gaine retractable 24 Fr, puis, en utilisant le catheter pre-charge, un guide long etait capture a lâ€™aide dâ€™un lasso, etablissant ainsi un double acces femoral. Une gaine femorale controlaterale 12 Fr etait avancee au niveau de la bifurcation aortique puis au-dela jusquâ€™a la branche laterale cousue. La reparation etait prolongee jusque dans lâ€™artere hypogastrique homolaterale grÃ¢ce a un stent couvert auto-expandable, ainsi que dans lâ€™artere iliaque externe en distalite, puis une endoprothese standard etait mise en place dans lâ€™aorte. Tous les patients etaient suivis cliniquement et beneficiaient dâ€™une tomodensitometrie injectee avant la sortie puis tous les trois mois. Resultats La duree moyenne dâ€™intervention etait de 172 Â± 23 min, dont 45 Â± 22 min pour modifier lâ€™endoprothese. La duree totale de scopie, la dose de contraste, et le rayonnement ionisant etaient de 78 Â± 17 min, 180 Â± 23 mL, et 3,890 Â± 1,034 mGy, respectivement. Un succes technique etait obtenu dans tous les cas. Il nâ€™y avait pas de rupture anevrysmale, de deces, de conversion, ou de complication. La duree moyenne dâ€™hospitalisation etait de 3,5 Â± 1 jours.

Evaluation of imputed genomic data in discrete traits using Random forest and Bayesian threshold methodsb,"The objectives of this study were (1) to quantify imputation accuracy and to assess the factors affecting it; and (2) to evaluate the accuracy of threshold BayesA (TBA), Bayesian threshold LASSO (BTL) and random forest (RF) algorithms to analyze discrete traits. Genomic data were simulated to reflect variations in heritability (h 2 = 0.30 and 0.10), number of QTL (QTL = 81 and 810), number of SNP (10 K and 50 K) and linkage disequilibrium (LD=low and high) for 27 chromosomes. For real condition simulating, we randomly masked markers with 90% missing rate for each scenario; afterwards, hidden markers were imputed using FImpute software. In imputed genotypes, a wide range of accuracy was observed for RF (0.164-0.512) compared to TBA (0.283-0.469) and BTL (0.272-0.504). Comparing to original genotypes, using imputed genotypes decreased the average accuracy of genomic prediction about 0.0273 (range of 0.024 to 0.036). Comparing to Bayesian threshold, using RF was improved rapidly accuracy of genomic prediction with increase in the marker density. Despite the higher accuracy of BTL and TBA at different levels of LD and heritability, the increase in accuracy was greater for RF. Furthermore, the best method for prediction of genomic accuracy depends on genomic architecture of population.",2018,Acta Scientiarum. Animal Sciences
Development of a multivariable normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) model for tube feeding dependence after curative radiotherapy/chemo-radiotherapy in head and neck cancer.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
Curative radiotherapy/chemo-radiotherapy for head and neck cancer (HNC) may result in severe acute and late side effects, including tube feeding dependence. The purpose of this prospective cohort study was to develop a multivariable normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) model for tube feeding dependence 6 months (TUBEM6) after definitive radiotherapy, radiotherapy plus cetuximab or concurrent chemoradiation based on pre-treatment and treatment characteristics.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
The study included 355 patients with HNC. TUBEM6 was scored prospectively in a standard follow-up program. To design the prediction model, the penalized learning method LASSO was used, with TUBEM6 as the endpoint.


RESULTS
The prevalence of TUBEM6 was 10.7%. The multivariable model with the best performance consisted of the variables: advanced T-stage, moderate to severe weight loss at baseline, accelerated radiotherapy, chemoradiation, radiotherapy plus cetuximab, the mean dose to the superior and inferior pharyngeal constrictor muscle, to the contralateral parotid gland and to the cricopharyngeal muscle.


CONCLUSIONS
We developed a multivariable NTCP model for TUBEM6 to identify patients at risk for tube feeding dependence. The dosimetric variables can be used to optimize radiotherapy treatment planning aiming at prevention of tube feeding dependence and to estimate the benefit of new radiation technologies.",2014,Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology

Efficient First Order Methods for Linear Composite Regularizers,"A wide class of regularization problems in machine learning and statistics employ a regularization term which is obtained by composing a simple convex function \omega with a linear transformation. This setting includes Group Lasso methods, the Fused Lasso and other total variation methods, multi-task learning methods and many more. In this paper, we present a general approach for computing the proximity operator of this class of regularizers, under the assumption that the proximity operator of the function \omega is known in advance. Our approach builds on a recent line of research on optimal first order optimization methods and uses fixed point iterations for numerically computing the proximity operator. It is more general than current approaches and, as we show with numerical simulations, computationally more efficient than available first order methods which do not achieve the optimal rate. In particular, our method outperforms state of the art O(1/T) methods for overlapping Group Lasso and matches optimal O(1/T^2) methods for the Fused Lasso and tree structured Group Lasso.",2011,ArXiv
External Constraints Matter for Privatizations,"We present an analysis of the share of public ownership in the product market in the OECD countries from 1974 to 2007. Despite much has been said on the broad topic of reforms and regulation, a sector-specific insight is missing. We replicate the analysis of Galasso (2014) by sector of activity accounting both for the dynamic bias of the lagged public ownership and the degree of state ownership at the beginning of the period. At the aggregate level both persistence and initial conditions play a major role, together with the European Single Market Program membership. Specifically, EMU members have a smaller share of public ownership in the electricity sector, while SMP members have less privatized telecommunications. Looking at the sub-sample of years when a change in the share of public ownership occurred, we find a composition effect of SMP: it has a negative impact on public ownership in telecommunications, but a positive one in the rail sector. Overall, we find that the countries in our sample tend to privatize mainly when decision taken at the supranational level (the EU for European countries) push towards this policy.",2014,
"Evolution of PGE mineralization in hortonolitic dunites of the Mooihoek and Onverwacht pipes, Bushveld Complex","SummaryPlatinum group minerals (PGM) and associated silicates, oxides and sulfides from four samples of platiniferous hortonolitic dunites of the Mooihoek and Onverwacht pipes, Bushveld Complex, show the following PGM assemblages: 1) (Pt, Fe) alloy similar to isoferroplatinum in composition, syngenetic with olivine; 2) sperrylite, syngenetic with clinopyroxene; 3) tetraferroplatinum, laurite, hollingworthite, unnamed mineral (Rh, Ru)AsS, syngenetic with titanomagnetite; 4) tetraferroplatinum (?), sperrylite, geversite, hollingworthite, platarsite, cabriite, rustenburgite, sobolevskite (?) and unnamed (Pd, Pt)4(Cu, Fe)2(Sn, Sb)3, (Pt, Ir)3Sb, (Rh, Ir, Pt)SbS, Rh(Sb, Bi)S, and Pt(Bi, Sb), syngenetic with late amphiboles, magnetite, chlorite, ilmenite, and pentlandite.Fine (less than 0.1 mm) drop-like sulfide inclusions, consisting of troilite, ferruginous chalcopyrite, ferruginous pentlandite, and encircled by micrograins of magnetite, ilmenite, amphiboles, and biotite, were found in nonbroken grains of olivine. The inclusions' bulk composition is that of high-temperature sulfide phase in equilibrium with high-iron silicate melt, under conditions of low sulfur fugacity.The temperatures at which different mineral assemblages were formed were studied in a sample of wehrlite, rich in titanomagnetite, and the following stages were identified: 1) a high temperature (980â€“1020Â°C) stage measured using two-pyroxene thermometry; and 2) a high to medium temperature stage, measured using exsolution textures of titanomagnetite aggregates. This stage occurs in three stages: first, exsolution in the magnetite-ulvÃ¶spinel-spinel system (separation of Zn-Cr-hercynite, 800â€“1000Â°C); later, in the magnetite-ulvÃ¶spinel system (separation of ulvÃ¶spinel, about 500Â°C); and finally oxidizing exsolution with the genesis of ilmenite (590â€“410Â°C with âˆ’log fO2 being 21 and 33, respectively).Evolutionary features of mineral assemblages suggest that hortonolitic dunites underwent, partly at least, a magmatic stage and a lengthy stage of subsolidus autometamorphic transformations under the influence of metal-bearing fluid.Low solubility of platinoids in silicate and low-sulfur sulfide melts probably was the reason for, on the one hand, direct crystallization of PGM from melt, unrelated to separations of primary sulfide phase, and, on the other hand, concentration of platinum group elements (PGE) in fluid. The PGE-rich fluid generated numerous PGM assemblages both at the stage of crystallization of residual melt which concentrated iron and titanium (inclusions in titanomagnetite) and as the result of intense medium-temperature autometasomatic reworking of primary hortonolitic dunites (simultaneously with minerals of the late chlorite-magnetite-amphibole assemblage).ZusammenfassungMinerale der Platingruppe (PGM) und assoziierte Silikate, Oxide und Sulfide aus vier Proben von Platin-fÃ¼hrenden Hortonolith-Duniten der Mooihoek und Onverwacht-Pipes, Bushveld-Komplex, fÃ¼hren die folgenden Mineralassoziationen: 1. (Pt, Fe) Legierung, die in ihrer Zusammensetzung Isoferroplatin Ã¤hnlich und syngenetisch mit Olivin ist 2) Sperrylith, der syngenetisch mit Klinopyroxen ist 3) Tetraferroplatin, Laurit, Hollingworthit, ein noch nicht benanntes Mineral (Rh, Ru)AsS, das syngenetisch mit Titanomagnetit ist 4) Tetraferroplatin (?), Sperrylith, Geversit, Hollingworthit, Platarsit, Cabriit, Rustenburgit, Sobolevskit (?) sowie die noch nicht benannten Minerale (Pd, Pt)4(Cu, Fe)2(Sn, Sb)3, (Pt, Ir)3Sb, (Rh, Ir, Pt)SbS, Rh(Sb, Bi)S, and Pt(Bi, Sb), die syngenetisch mit spÃ¤ten Amphibolen, Magnetit, Chlorit, Ilmenit und Pentlandit sind.Feine (weniger als 0.1 mm) trÃ¶pfchenfÃ¶rmige SulfdeinschlÃ¼sse, die aus Troilit, eisenreichem Chalcopyrit und eisenreichem Pentlandit bestehen und von winzigen KÃ¶rnern von Magnetit, Ilmenit, Amphibol und Biotit umgeben sind, kommen im Olivin vor. Die Gesamtzusammensetzung dieser EinschlÃ¼sse ist bei niedriger SchwefelfugazitÃ¤t im Gleichgewicht mit einer eisenreichen Silikatschmelze.Die Temperaturen, bei denen die verschiedenen Mineralgesellschaften gebildet wurden, wurden in einer Probe von Titanomagnetit-reichem Wehrlit untersucht, und die folgenden Stadien wurden identifiziert: 1) ein Hochtemperaturstadium (980â€“1020Â°C), das auf der Basis von Zwei-Pyroxen-Thermometrie bestimmt wurde und 2) ein Hoch- bis Mitteltemperaturstadium, das auf der Basis von Entmischungstexturen von Titanomagnetit-Aggregaten gemessen wurde. Hier sind drei Gruppen zu unterscheiden:1.)Entmischung im Magnetit-UlvÃ¶spinell-Spinell-System (Bildung von Zn-Cr-Hercynit, 800â€“1000Â°C); spÃ¤ter, im Magnetit-UlvÃ¶spinell-System (Abtrennung von UlvÃ¶spinell bei ungefÃ¤hr 500Â°C) und schlieÃŸlich oxidierende Entmischung mit Entstehung von Ilmenit (590â€“410Â°C mit-log fO2 von 21 bzw. 33).
Die beobachteten Mineralvergesellschaftungen weisen darauf hin, daÃŸ die Horthonolit-Dunite zumindest teilweise ein magmatisches Stadium durchlaufen haben und daÃŸ sich dann ein sehr ausgedehntes Stadium von autometamorphem Subsolidusumwandlungen unter dem EinfluÃŸ von metallfÃ¼hrenden Fluiden anschloÃŸ.Die niedrige LÃ¶slichkeit von Platinmetallen in Silikatschmelzen und in schwefelarmen Sulfid-Schmelzen war wahrscheinlich der Grund dafÃ¼r, daÃŸ einerseits eine direkte Kristallisation von PGM aus der Schmelze erfolgte, die in keinerlei Beziehung zur Abtrennung einer primÃ¤ren Sulfdphase stand und daÃŸ andererseits Konzentrationen der Platingruppenelemte (PGE) in Fluiden zustande gekommen sind. Die PGE-reichen Fluide fÃ¼hrten zur Entstehung zahlreicher PGM-Vergesellschaftungen und zwar sowohl im Stadium der Kristallisation der Restschmelze, die Eisen- und Titan konzentrierte (EinschlÃ¼sse in Titanmagnetit) und als Resultat intensiver autometasomatischer Beeinflussung bei mittleren Temperaturen der primÃ¤ren Horthonolit-Dunite gleichzeitig mit den Mineralen der spÃ¤ten Fluid-Magnetit-Amphibol-Vergesellschaftung.",1992,Mineralogy and Petrology
"Tracing 2000 Years at the Source of the Douix, CÃ´te-dâ€™Or, France: Water, Offerings, and Recurrence","The Source of the Douix in ChÃ¢tillon-sur-Seine, France, has been visited by local inhabitants for over 2000 years and served as a watery focal point for the ritual deposition of various types of offerings. While water deposits are by no means uncommon across Europe, the continued use of a single space over multiple millennia is. An examination of the preserved offerings at the Douix indicate there are three phases of depositional activity: late Hallstatt to early La Tene periods, late La Tene to Gallo-Roman periods, and the early modern period. Despite being separated by hundreds of years there are similarities across depositional phases including the importance of modified metallic objects, personal ornamentation, and possible connections to women. Could the persistence of these ritual practices be the result of behavioural and ideological continuities? If not, how can we interpret this complex record of intermittent deposition? We examine the deposits from each phase in their wider social and ritual contexts, including the Douixâ€™s connection to the Hallstatt princely centre of Mont Lassois, Gallo-Roman ritual traditions, and the historic folklore surrounding springs. We then explore the inter-depositional phases and discuss the conditions that could lead to the persistence of ideas despite the dearth of material evidence and summarise what these patterns mean for the history of ritual activity at the Source of the Douix.",2019,

Bayesian LASSO in a distributed architecture,"We present a distributed framework for finding the full posterior distribution associated with LASSO problems. We leverage our recent results of formulating Bayesian inference as a KL divergence minimization problem that can be solved with linear algebra updates and a series of convex point estimation problems. We show that drawing samples from the Bayesian LASSO posterior can be done by iteratively solving LASSO problems in parallel. Motivated by wearable applications where (a) the energy cost of continuous wireless transmission is prohibitive and (b) cloud storage of data induces privacy vulnerabilities, we propose a class of `analog-to-information' architectures that only transmit the minimal relevant information (e.g. the posterior) for optimal decision-making. We instantiate this result with an analog-implementable solver and show that the posterior can be calculated with systems of low-energy analog circuits in a distributed manner.",2015,2015 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)
Bayesian two-step Lasso strategy for biomarker selection in personalized medicine development for time-to-event endpoints.,"Clinical trial designs for targeted therapy development are progressing toward the goal of personalized medicine. Motivated by the need of ongoing efforts to develop targeted agents for lung cancer patients, we propose a Bayesian two-step Lasso procedure for biomarker selection under the proportional hazards model. We seek to identify the key markers that are either prognostic or predictive with respect to treatment from a large number of biomarkers. In the first step of our two-step strategy, we use the Bayesian group Lasso to identify the important marker groups, wherein each group contains the main effect of a single marker and its interactions with treatments. Applying a loose selection criterion in the first step, the goal of first step is to screen out unimportant biomarkers. In the second step, we zoom in to select the individual markers and interactions between markers and treatments in order to identify prognostic or predictive markers using the Bayesian adaptive Lasso. Our strategy takes a full Bayesian approach and is built upon rapid advancement of Lasso methodologies with variable selection. The proposed method is generally applicable to the development of targeted therapies in clinical trials. Our simulation study demonstrates the good performance of the two-step Lasso: Important biomarkers can typically be selected with high probabilities, and unimportant markers can be effectively eliminated from the model.",2013,Contemporary clinical trials
Single channel reverberation suppression based on sparse linear prediction,"Reverberation degrades speech intelligibility in telecommunications as well as it increases the word error rate in automatic speech recognition tasks. Several dereverberation methods have been proposed recently in order to counter these effects. In the single microphone case, the dereverberation problem is underdetermined and reverberation suppression approaches are preferred. In this paper we propose a novel method for single channel reverberation suppression. Late reverberation is estimated in the time-frequency domain as a sparse linear combination of previous frames. The predictors associated to the model are determined in a Lasso framework and a spectral subtraction filter is designed to produce the enhanced signal. This model does not require any additional information about the room acoustics and it is well suited for real-time applications. The method has state-of-the-art performance in terms of both reverberation suppression and spectral distortion.",2014,"2014 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)"
The Inhabited Threshold. The Limits of Dialectics in Julio Cano Lassoâ€™s House,"Julio Canoâ€™s house-office in La Florida is studied in this text as a clear realization of a conception of the domestic phenomenon as a threshold that sequentially articulates the transit between public and private space. It also serves to illustrate the character of limit that architecture has as a discipline and as a mechanism of spatial production. Julio Cano Lassoâ€™s design tactic used in this building is based on the establishment of rites of passage and the limits of dialectics that link to the history of domestic architecture ranging from the traditional Japanese house to Wrightâ€™s Usonian houses. The exemplary character of the building resides in a lay out that shows quite literally a stratification which acts as a regulator of the relationship between the exterior and the interior of the house. This condition, simultaneously, subtly modulates both the degree of privacy of each room and the conditions of permeability among them.",2016,
The Factor-Lasso and K-Step Bootstrap Approach for Inference in High-Dimensional Economic Applications,"We consider inference about coefficients on a small number of variables of interest in a linear panel data model with additive unobserved individual and time specific effects and a large number of additional time-varying confounding variables. We allow the number of these additional confounding variables to be larger than the sample size, and suppose that, in addition to unrestricted time and individual specific effects, these confounding variables are generated by a small number of common factors and high-dimensional weakly-dependent disturbances. We allow that both the factors and the disturbances are related to the outcome variable and other variables of interest. To make informative inference feasible, we impose that the contribution of the part of the confounding variables not captured by time specific effects, individual specific effects, or the common factors can be captured by a relatively small number of terms whose identities are unknown. Within this framework, we provide a convenient computational algorithm based on factor extraction followed by lasso regression for inference about parameters of interest and show that the resulting procedure has good asymptotic properties. We also provide a simple k-step bootstrap procedure that may be used to construct inferential statements about parameters of interest and prove its asymptotic validity. The proposed bootstrap may be of substantive independent interest outside of the present context as the proposed bootstrap may readily be adapted to other contexts involving inference after lasso variable selection and the proof of its validity requires some new technical arguments. We also provide simulation evidence about performance of our procedure and illustrate its use in two empirical applications.",2016,arXiv: Methodology
Supersparse Linear Integer Models for Predictive Scoring Systems,"Scoring systems are classification models that make predictions using a sparse linear combination of variables with integer coefficients. Such systems are frequently used in medicine because they are interpretable; that is, they only require users to add, subtract and multiply a few meaningful numbers in order to make a prediction. See, for instance, these commonly used scoring systems: (Gage et al. 2001; Le Gall et al. 1984; Le Gall, Lemeshow, and Saulnier 1993; Knaus et al. 1985). Scoring systems strike a delicate balance between accuracy and interpretability that is difficult to replicate with existing machine learning algorithms. 
 
Current linear methods such as the lasso, elastic net and LARS are not designed to create scoring systems, since regularization is primarily used to improve accuracy as opposed to sparsity and interpretability (Tibshirani 1996; Zou and Hastie 2005; Efron et al. 2004). These methods can produce very sparse models through heavy regularization or feature selection methods (Guyon and Elisseeff 2003); however, feature selection often relies on greedy optimization and cannot guarantee an optimal balance between sparsity and accuracy. Moreover, the interpretability of scoring systems requires integer coefficients, which these methods do not produce. Existing approaches to interpretable modeling include decision trees and lists (Ruping 2006; Quinlan 1986; Rivest 1987; Letham et al. 2013). 
 
We introduce a formal approach for creating scoring systems, called Supersparse Linear Integer Models (SLIM). SLIM produces scoring systems that are accurate and interpretable using a mixed-integer program (MIP) whose objective penalizes the training error, L0-norm and L1-norm of its coefficients. SLIM can create scoring systems for datasets with thousands of training examples and tens to hundreds of features - larger than the sizes of most studies in medicine, where scoring systems are often used.",2013,

Generalized grouped contributions for hierarchical fault diagnosis with group Lasso,"Abstract In process industries, it is necessary to conduct fault diagnosis after abnormality is found, with the aim to identify root cause variables and further provide instructive information for maintenance. Contribution plots along with multivariate statistical process monitoring are standard tools towards this goal, which, however, suffer from the smearing effect and high diagnostic complexity on large-scale processes. In fact, process variables tend to be naturally grouped, and in this work, a novel fault identification strategy based on group Lasso penalty along with a hierarchical fault diagnosis scheme is proposed by leveraging group information among variables. By introducing the group Lasso as a regularization approach, groups of irrelevant variables tend to yield exactly zero contributions collectively, which help find the exact root cause, alleviate the smearing effect, and furnish clear diagnostic information for process practitioners. For online computational convenience, an efficient numerical solution strategy is also presented. Besides, it turns out that the proposed approach also applies to dynamic monitoring models with lagged measurements augmented, thereby enjoying widespread generality. Its effectiveness is evaluated on both the Tennessee Eastman benchmark process and a pilot-scale experiment apparatus.",2019,Control Engineering Practice
Estimation and Variable Selection for Semiparametric Additive Partial Linear Models (SS-09-140).,"Semiparametric additive partial linear models, containing both linear and nonlinear additive components, are more flexible compared to linear models, and they are more efficient compared to general nonparametric regression models because they reduce the problem known as ""curse of dimensionality"". In this paper, we propose a new estimation approach for these models, in which we use polynomial splines to approximate the additive nonparametric components and we derive the asymptotic normality for the resulting estimators of the parameters. We also develop a variable selection procedure to identify significant linear components using the smoothly clipped absolute deviation penalty (SCAD), and we show that the SCAD-based estimators of non-zero linear components have an oracle property. Simulations are performed to examine the performance of our approach as compared to several other variable selection methods such as the Bayesian Information Criterion and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO). The proposed approach is also applied to real data from a nutritional epidemiology study, in which we explore the relationship between plasma beta-carotene levels and personal characteristics (e.g., age, gender, body mass index (BMI), etc.) as well as dietary factors (e.g., alcohol consumption, smoking status, intake of cholesterol, etc.).",2011,Statistica Sinica
Neutrophilic Asthma Asma neutrofÃ­lica,"The goal of systems or personalized medicine is to deliver the optimal drug to the right patient at the right time.1,2 A prerequisite for this is the correct identification of asthma clinical phenotypes that possess mechanisms that can be targeted by specific drugs. Eosinophilic asthma is one such phenotype which is characterized by elevated levels of circulating eosinophils. These patients have an underlying type 2 T-helper cell (Th2) mechanism, are more responsive to treatment with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) but conversely appear more susceptible to exacerbations.1,2 The appreciation of the Th2-based driver mechanism of these patients has driven the use of biological therapies targeted Th2 cytokines. For example, anti-IL-5-directed drugs used to block eosinophil differentiation and activation are effective in patients with high blood eosinophils, severe and recurrent exacerbations already requiring high dose ICS and oral corticosteroids (OCS) 1,2. Unfortunately, only 40-50% of asthmatics have this phenotype and there is a need to define non-Th2 asthma along with their associated driver mechanisms. Neutrophilic asthma was first reported in bronchial biopsies 3but is more often defined as patients with high (40-70%) sputum neutrophil counts. Sputum neutrophilia is linked to severe asthma, a relative lack of response to corticosteroid therapy and chronic airflow obstruction, 3and is reported to occur in acute exacerbations3. A neutrophilic asthma phenotype may arise from the presence of enhanced levels of neutrophilic chemokines such as GRO , interleukin 8, CXCL10, and CCL2 which are all elevated in sputum of these patients.3 However, a number of clinical trials directed against neutrophilassociated mediators have not been successful in moderate to severe asthma. These studies include an antibody against TNF (golimumab), an anti-IL-17 receptor antibody (brodalumab) and with a CXCR2 antagonist.3 In the latter study, involving 640 patients with uncontrolled persistent asthma, treatment for 6 months with the CXCR2 antagonist AZD5069, that blocks the effects of interleukin 8, had no effect on the rate of severe exacerbations, asthma symptoms, or lung function compared with placebo despite significantly reducing mean blood neutrophil counts.4",2018,

Signature Selection for Grouped Features with a Case Study on Exon Microarrays,"When features are grouped, it is desirable to perform feature selection groupwise in addition to selecting individual features. It is typically the case in data obtained by modern high-throughput genomic profiling technologies such as exon microarrays, which measure the amount of gene expression in fine resolution. Exons are disjoint subsequences corresponding to coding regions in genes, and exon microarrays enable us to study the event of different usage of exons, called alternative splicing, which is presumed to contribute to development of diseases. To identify such events, all exons that belong to a relevant gene may have to be selected, perhaps with different weights assigned to them to detect most relevant ones. In this chapter we discuss feature selection methods to handle grouped features. A popular shrinkage method, lasso, and its variants will be our focus, that are based on regularized regression with generalized linear models. Data from exon microarrays will be used for a case study.",2015,
Serapan Karbon Lamun Thalassodendron ciliatum di Perairan Panrangluhu Kabupaten Bulukumba Propinsi Sulawesi Selatan,"Penelitian dilakukan pada bulan Mei 2019 untuk mengestimasi penyerapan karbon oleh jenis Thalassodendron ciliatum pada beberapa kedalaman perairan. Sampel lamun diambil utuh, kemudian daun lamun dibersihkan dari sedimen dan epifit. Metode perubahan oksigen digunakan untuk mengestimasi serapan karbon. Sebanyak 1 tunas T. ciliatum diinkubasi menggunakan botol kaca bening dan gelap dengan volume 270 ml. Inkubasi dilakukan pada jam 09.00-12.00 WITA pada kedalaman 50, 100 dan 150 cm dengan masing-masing 5 kali ulangan setiap kedalaman. Sebelum inkubasi, dilakukan pengukuran konsentrasi oksigen terlarut di perairan sebagai kandungan oksigen awal. Pengukuran oksigen di dalam botol beningdan gelap kembali dilakukan setelah inkubasi. Sebagai kontrol, inkubasi juga dilakukan pada air laut (mengandung fitoplankton) dengan 5 kali ulangan. Daun lamun yang telah digunakan untuk pengamatan serapan karbon diukur luasnya dengan cara men-scan daun lamun dan dianalisis menggunakan software Image-J. Selanjutnya dilakukan pengeringan menggunakan oven dan ditimbang untuk mengetahui biomassa keringnya. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa serapan karbon per tunas berkisar antara 3,84-6,52 mgCO 2 /tunas/jam, per biomassa berkisar 28,51-48,45 mgCO 2 /gbk/jam, dan per luas daun berkisar 0,08-0,13 mgCO 2 /cm 2 /jam. Serapan karbon tertinggi didapatkan pada kedalaman 150 cm, baik serapan karbon per tunas, biomass maupun luas daun. Berbeda dengan penyerapan karbon, pelepasan karbon relatif sama antar kedlaman. Pelepasan karbon per tegakan berkisar antara 3,18-3,91 mgO 2 /tegakan/jam, per biomassa daun berkisar 23,67-29,08 mgO 2 /g berat kering/jam dan per luas daun berkisar 0,30-0,034 mgO 2 /cm 2 /jam.

Forecasting college football game outcomes using modern modeling techniques,"There are many reasons why data scientists and fans of college football would want to forecast the outcome of games â€“ gambling, game preparation and academic research, for example. As advanced statistical methods become more readily accessible, so do the opportunities to develop robust forecasting models. Using data from the 2011 to 2014 seasons, we implemented a variety of advanced modeling techniques to determine which best forecasts the outcome of games. These methods included ridge regression, the lasso, the elastic net, neural networks, random forests, k-nearest neighbors, stochastic gradient boosting, and a Bayesian regression model. To evaluate the efficacy of the proposed models, we tested them on data from the 2015 season. The top performers â€“ lasso regression, a Bayesian regression with team-specific variances, stochastic gradient boosting, and random forests â€“ predicted the correct outcome over 70% of the time, and the lasso model proved most accurate at predicting win-loss outcomes in the 2015 test data set. 7",2020,Journal of Systems Architecture
The inferior vena cava: an exceptional source of atrial fibrillation.,"Mapping in a patient undergoing radiofrequency ablation for drug-refractory paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in the setting of repetitive, monomorphic atrial ectopic beats with negative p waves in the inferior leads revealed an arrhythmogenic focus located in the posteromedial inferior vena cava (IVC) 1 cm below the right atrium to IVC junction. The focus was mapped using a Lasso catheter with successful irrigated-tip catheter ablation at the site of earliest activity. This case demonstrates that, in rare cases, arrhythmogenic muscular sleeves can be found in the IVC and that the IVC can be electrically disconnected from the right atrium using radiofrequency energy.",2003,Journal of cardiovascular electrophysiology
New bandwidth selection criterion for Kernel PCA: Approach to dimensionality reduction and classification problems,"BackgroundDNA microarrays are potentially powerful technology for improving diagnostic classification, treatment selection, and prognostic assessment. The use of this technology to predict cancer outcome has a history of almost a decade. Disease class predictors can be designed for known disease cases and provide diagnostic confirmation or clarify abnormal cases. The main input to this class predictors are high dimensional data with many variables and few observations. Dimensionality reduction of these features set significantly speeds up the prediction task. Feature selection and feature transformation methods are well known preprocessing steps in the field of bioinformatics. Several prediction tools are available based on these techniques.ResultsStudies show that a well tuned Kernel PCA (KPCA) is an efficient preprocessing step for dimensionality reduction, but the available bandwidth selection method for KPCA was computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a new data-driven bandwidth selection criterion for KPCA, which is related to least squares cross-validation for kernel density estimation. We propose a new prediction model with a well tuned KPCA and Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM). We estimate the accuracy of the newly proposed model based on 9 case studies. Then, we compare its performances (in terms of test set Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) and computational time) with other well known techniques such as whole data set + LS-SVM, PCA + LS-SVM, t-test + LS-SVM, Prediction Analysis of Microarrays (PAM) and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Lasso). Finally, we assess the performance of the proposed strategy with an existing KPCA parameter tuning algorithm by means of two additional case studies.ConclusionWe propose, evaluate, and compare several mathematical/statistical techniques, which apply feature transformation/selection for subsequent classification, and consider its application in medical diagnostics. Both feature selection and feature transformation perform well on classification tasks. Due to the dynamic selection property of feature selection, it is hard to define significant features for the classifier, which predicts classes of future samples. Moreover, the proposed strategy enjoys a distinctive advantage with its relatively lesser time complexity.",2013,BMC Bioinformatics
Application d'un modÃ¨le de prÃ©vision de la santÃ© des enfants en relation avec les conditions environnementales,"La determination des risques de sante a l'enfance implique une tÃ¢che predictive importante. Identifier ces facteurs de risques permet d'intervenir rapidement et de reduire les consequences nefastes d'une mauvaise sante de l'enfant sur sa vie future. Bien que plusieurs determinants socioeconomiques aient deja ete montres comme causes importantes de mauvaise sante chez l'enfant, peu d'etudes utilisent des variables environnementales dans leur modele. C'est en ce sens que ce memoire s'interesse a l'apport de variables environnementales dans la prediction de la sante de l'enfant. Les donnees utilisees proviennent de l'echantillon d'enfants longitudinal de l'Enquete longitudinale nationale sur les enfants et les jeunes (ELNEJ) et de la Base de donnees pancanadienne sur la qualite de l'air (BDPQA). Les predictions sont faites avec differents modeles de regressions et de methodes en arbre a plusieurs stades de l'enfance, avec et sans variables environnementales. Les resultats revelent que les deux meilleures methodes de predictions sont la methode lasso avec forme fonctionnelle Logit, ainsi que la methode boosting. Les trois variables les plus predictives de la sante de l'enfant sont la sante de la mere a la naissance, la sante de l'enfant a la naissance et le revenu familial. L'ajout de variables environnementales dans la prediction semble surspecifier les modeles et ainsi, nuire a leur performance.

Single-snapshot DoA estimation using adaptive elastic net in the complex domain,"The elastic net (EN) is a popular regularization and variable selection method that overcomes the shortcomings of Lasso such as poor recovery in the face of high mutual coherence. In this paper, we develop an efficient algorithm to solve the weighted EN criterion for complex-valued measurements applying the cyclic coordinate descent approach. We illustrate that usage of smartly chosen adaptive (i.e., data-dependent) weights revamps the algorithm to overcome the shortcomings of naive (non-weighted) EN and enhances the exact recovery. Usefulness of the proposed algorithm is illustrated for compressed beamforming (CBF) with the single-snapshot DoA (direction-of-arrival) estimation, in a demanding multi-source scenario that contains closely spaced sources having large variation in source powers. Accurate DoA's estimation performance and error plummet by the proposed algorithm validates its application and advocates its potential usage in other signal processing problems.",2016,"2016 4th International Workshop on Compressed Sensing Theory and its Applications to Radar, Sonar and Remote Sensing (CoSeRa)"

"[The ""necktie lasso"": a new technique for the simultaneous treatment of Wartenberg's sign and claw deformities in the hand due to ulnar nerve palsy].","The ""necktie lasso"" is a new technique that allows the simultaneous active treatment, of both Wartenberg's sign and claw deformity of the fifth and the fourth digits in the hand with ulnar nerve palsy. The flexor sublimis of the fourth digit is taken by a palmar approach. It is then divided into two strips up to the proximal part of the palm; The radial strip is used as a classical ""direct lasso"" to treat the claw deformity of the fourth digit; The ulnar strip is wound around the base of the fifth digit by a palmar and dorsal approaches at the level of the proximal phalanx, like a necktie, being medial to its radial pedicle, dorsal and superficial to its extensor apparatus, then lateral to its ulnar pedicle; It is then recovered in the palm and sutured to itself. From September 1998 to April 2003, this technique has been used in eight patients aged between 21 and 35 years old and suffering from post traumatic low ulnar nerve palsy. It was always very effective in dealing with Wartenberg's sign: the active adduction of the fifth digit appearing at the start of flexion. The claw deformity of the fourth and fifth digits was equally actively corrected. No complications are reported in this series. With a mean follow-up of 3 years there was no recurrence of any of the deformities.",2004,Chirurgie de la main

Seawater nanofiltration for the elaboration of usable salty waters,"Abstract Our article deals with the possibilities to treat seawater using commercial nanofiltration polyamide membranes, denoted NF70 and NF 200, in order to elaborate usable salty aqueous solutions (from high concentrated solutions with total salinity around 70 g/L to isotonic solutions with total salinity in the range of 4 g/L). A theoretical part concerned a hydrodynamical model of mass transfer. This very simple model based on the permeate salt concentrations (using conductivity measurements) vs. the reverse of the permeate flux has been validated for the first time for seawater. This very interesting approach is able to quantify separately both parts of the mass transfer occurring in NF â€” convection and hydration-diffusion. This fundamental approach was developed in order to contribute to a better understanding of the selectivities observed between monovalent and divalent ions in NF operation. The experiments were conducted in Biarritz (south-west France) under coal pre-filter seawater, just after the Prestige's oil pollution, in order to elaborate personal body washing solutions using NF permeates. Concerning the concentrates we have contributed to the elaboration of hypertonic salty solutions for thalassotherapy centers or home bath applications. Indeed the possibilities of NF in reducing the overall salinity of seawater leads the way to potential applications in the field of human health (e.g., preparation of nasal sprays, medical dietetics, hot mineral springs). Furthermore our investigations conducted in the holy place of the Biarritz Seawater Museum have contributed to discovery of the possibilities of NF concentrates for coral growth studies.",2004,Desalination
A DOA Estimation Method of coherent and uncorrelated sources based on Nested Arrays,"This paper presents a novel way to estimate the DOA of coherent and uncorrelated sources for nested array. At first, by using the vectorization of the covariance matrix of the received data, the LASSO algorithm with a modified dictionary matrix based on compressed sensing is applied to estimate a vector containing all signal powers. Then, the estimated vector is reconstructed into the covariance matrix of coherent and uncorrelated sources. A peak searching to estimate DOAs can be performed by using the diagonal elements of this reconstructed matrix. In this presented method, the advantage of fully utilizing the degree of freedom of nested arrays is preserved. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",2019,2019 Asia-Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference (APSIPA ASC)
On cross-validated Lasso,"In this paper, we derive a rate of convergence of the Lasso estimator when the penalty parameter ? for the estimator is chosen using K-fold cross-validation; in particular, we show that in the model with Gaussian noise and under fairly general assumptions on the candidate set of values of ?, the prediction norm of the estimation error of the cross-validated Lasso estimator is with high probability bounded from above up-to a constant by (s log p/n)1/2 (log7/8n) as long as p log n/n = o(1) and some other mild regularity conditions are satisfi ed where n is the sample size of available data, p is the number of covariates, and s is the number of non-zero coefficients in the model. Thus, the cross-validated Lasso estimator achieves the fastest possible rate of convergence up-to the logarithmic factor log7/8 n. In addition, we derive a sparsity bound for the cross-validated Lasso estimator; in particular, we show that under the same conditions as above, the number of non-zero coefficients of the estimator is with high probability bounded from above up-to a constant by s log5 n. Finally, we show that our proof technique generates non-trivial bounds on the prediction norm of the estimation error of the cross-validated Lasso estimator even if p is much larger than n and the assumption of Gaussian noise fails; in particular, the prediction norm of the estimation error is with high-probability bounded from above up-to a constant by (s log2(pn) / n)1/4 under mild regularity conditions.",2016,arXiv: Statistics Theory
Emergency medical services management of ST-elevation myocardial infarction.,"According todatapublishedby theAmericanHeartAssociation (AHA), the annual incidence of acutemyocardial infarction (AMI) in the United States approximates 850,000, resulting in over 150,000 deaths per year.1 The emergency medical services (EMS) system plays a significant role in the management of AMI with respect to caring for those who access the health care system via EMS and also in administering public educational programs to encourage early access via EMS. It is generally well accepted that early reperfusion is the primary goal of therapy for patients having an acute ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).2,3 Because many patients access the health care system via EMS, EMS providers are well positioned to facilitate achieving the goal of early reperfusion throughout the community.4 Consequently, the NationalAssociationofEMSPhysicians (NAEMSP)has developed a position statement on the role of EMS in the management of the STEMI patient and the development of cardiovascular systems of care.5 The NAEMSP believes that advanced life support EMS providers should have the education, appropriate training, equipment, and protocols to facilitate early identification and the initial care of patients with STEMI. Theseprotocols should address the appropriate use of 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) to facilitate early diagnosis of STEMI and initiation of pathways to ensure early definitive reperfusion.

Electrophysiological characteristics of pulmonary vein antrum in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation,"Objective To analyze the electrophysiological characteristics of pulmonary antrum by circumferential pulmonary vein(PV)isolation in cases with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) guided by the EnSite-NavX system. Methods 143 cases (85 males, mean age 60.7Â±10.3 years ) with paroxysmal AF were enrolled from October 2004 to December 2005. The mean duration of AF was 5.5Â±6.7 years(21daysï½ž50years), and the mean left atrium diameter was 36.9Â±6.4(24ï½ž54)mm. Circumferential PV isolation was performed guided by the EnSite-NavX system, combined with single Lasso technique. Results 143 cases underwent the procedure successfully, with the mean procedure time 157Â±30(90ï½ž240)min and the mean fluoroscopic time 25.8Â±8.8(9.8ï½ž60.1)min. The pulmonary vein isolation rate for the left ipsilateral PVs was 81.2% and 78.3% for the right PVs. Segmental ostial ablation was applied for the rest cases. AF terminated in 69.7%(23/33)cases by radiofrequency energy delivery. In the previous procedure, the automatic activities of PVs were documented in 91 cases, and pulmonary automatic tachyarrhythmias with stable sinus rhythm in surface ECG were observed in 3 cases. In the repeat procedure of recurrent AF, pulmonary vein potentials (PVPs) were observed in all 21 cases. Among them, a higher recovered PVP rate was observed in patients with pulmonary vein isolation combined with SOA in initiated procedure: PVP recovered in 57.1% in the left side and 55.6% in the right side. In the repeat procedure, automatic activeties of PVs were documented in 85.7%(18/21) cases. Post-ablation atrial tachyarrhythmia (ATa) was documented in 15 cases (10.5%), and was abolished by re-ablation in 12 cases. After a mean of 10.7Â±4.9(4ï½ž18)months of follow-up, 90.2%(129/143)cases without antiarrhythmic drugs were free of AF (including the repeat procedure). Pericardial effusion was found in 2 cases and was cured after proper treatment. And fault of Ensite/NavX patch was found in 1 case. Conclusions The electrical connections of PV-atrium is not â€œall or noneâ€. A higher recurrent rate is associated with the strategy of ablation with SOA. Automatic activity of PVs is observed in the majority of patients after isolation, and usually the activation of PVPs is more active in recurrent cases. The recovered pulmonary vein conduction is the dominant factor for recurrent ATa associated with circumferential pulmonary vein isolation.",2006,The Chinese Journal of Cardiac Pacing and Electrophysiology

Developing deterioration models for Wyoming bridges.,"Deterioration models for the Wyoming Bridge Inventory were developed using both stochastic and deterministic models. The selection of explanatory variables is investigated and a new method using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression to eliminate human bias in explanatory variable selection.The cross validation technique is used to determine the minimum number of explanatory variables. The relative significance of candidate variables is used to rank the explanatory variables in hierarchical order. The deterministic deterioration models are developed by using curve-fitting methods for the mean of bridge ages for each condition rating. In order to improve the accuracy in the model, bridges are split into the multiple subsets using first two explanatory variables for deck, superstructure, and substructure. Although the deterministic deterioration model is insufficient to predict condition ratings for a specific bridge, it is worthy to observe a general feature of how the functionality of bridges becomes worse over time. The stochastic models are developed to capture the uncertainty in the deterioration process using the Markov chain. The transition probability matrix is estimated using percentage prediction method,which counts the numbers corresponding to the element of transition probability matrix. The same subsets used in the deterministic deterioration models are considered. For each subset, zoning technique is used such that the bridge data is grouped for every 30 years to estimate transition probability matrix separately. The source codes are provided for the future update of bridge inventory and stochastic deterioration models. A computer program is used develop and plot deterioration models. A simple guideline is also included so that the user can access the source codes conveniently.",2016,
The Warehouse Group: Entry into Australia,"ABSTRACT The Warehouse has been a company synonymous with growth and success in New Zealand since Stephen Tindall founded the company in 1982. By 1999, The Warehouse had become the largest retailer in New Zealand and had continued to steam ahead since. In early 2001, incoming CEO Greg Muir faced a real challenge in transferring that success across the Tasman into Australia. In August 2000, The Warehouse had acquired the Clint's Crazy Bargains/Silly Solly's chain of 115 discount variety stores in Australia. Could The Warehouse implement their format in Australia and would it be as successful as in New Zealand? INTRODUCTION In November 2000, The Warehouse Group was named New Zealand's Company of the Year at the annual business awards organised by Deloitte's and Management magazine. The award came on the heels of The Warehouse's Annual Meeting where the company was able to announce sales in excess of a billion dollars for the first time. Profits too were soaring, up almost 30% on the previous year. Excellent results, however, were not new to Warehouse shareholders. Stephen Tindall, the founder of the company, had built The Warehouse into a phenomenal success, with an average return on equity of 37% and compound sales growth of 29% over the last decade. The 2000 annual meeting did more than reflect on an excellent year, however. The meeting also served to publicly signal the succession of Stephen Tindall as CEO by Greg Muir in January 2001. The transition in CEO coincided with the transition of The Warehouse from a company focused solely on the New Zealand market to one focused on Australasia. On August 1 2000, The Warehouse took possession of their first Australian outlets. The company acquired a 115store Australian discount retail chain that operated as Glint's Crazy Bargains in New South Wales, ACT, and Victoria, and as Silly Solly's in Queensland. The Australian stores represented a major challenge for The Warehouse. They were less than a third of the size of the average Warehouse store in New Zealand and were supported by relatively immature logistics and IT. Stephen Tindall had described the Australian stores as being in a similar state to The Warehouse seven years ago (Management Magazine 2000, p. 28). Moreover, The Warehouse had no experience in acquisitions - let alone international acquisitions. Entering the Australian market meant competing against large, entrenched competitors with a history of retaliation against newcomers. However, while there were risks in the Australian expansion, The Warehouse had a history of setting and achieving bold challenges. THE NEW ZEALAND MARKET The New Zealand retail market was small, but well served. For the 2000 calendar year department store sales were almost $2.6b, although the total applicable market for The Warehouse (including specialty areas such as clothing, hardware, etc) was $11.9b. Growth over 1999 was 4.9% for general retail, 8.3% for department stores, and 6.5% for the applicable market. New Zealand had approximately 30,000 stores - dominated by small, owner-operated outlets. However, just as internationally, there has been a trend in New Zealand away from the independent retailers towards chains. The scale advantages of the larger chains have created significant pressure for smaller retailers to, at the very least, band together in a loose collective such as Paper Plus. The Warehouse faced direct competition from department stores Deka, Farmers, Kmart and Briscoes at a national level. Table 1 shows a comparison between these national competitors. At a regional level, department stores such as Arthur Barnett's (Dunedin) and Furlongs (Hamilton) also competed. Further competition was also provided by specialty stores - some national such as Glassons/Hallensteins (clothes), Whitcoulls (books) and Hannahs (shoes) - but predominantly localised. Market share information for department stores is provided in Figure 1. Retail competition in New Zealand has been very strong. â€¦",2003,Journal of Management & Organization
Dividing stage 3 of chronic kidney disease (CKD): 3A and 3B.,"To the Editor: Changing the chronic kidney disease (CKD) staging system, as proposed by Winearls and Glassock,1 could have a negative impact on prevention. One of the hardest tasks faced by a nephrologist is breaking the news about imminent dialysis to an unsuspecting patient. This gets ever more painful if early signs of kidney disease, such as a mildly depressed glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), were somehow uncovered in the past but the patient was reassured without further testing and sent home only to learn otherwise at a later date. Bad as it seems, this is a recurrent experience for any nephrologist. Therefore, we were concerned with this proposition to revise the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) staging system of CKD and eliminate the current early stages of the system. Although we recognize that a proportion of healthy individuals may be transitorily mislabeled as CKD patients, we believe that it is better to raise the possibility of incipient CKD and discard it afterward than to miss diagnosis by not looking for it. The current staging system of CKD has been very successful in bringing worldwide uniformity to the nomenclature and has met the goal of raising awareness within the renal and nonrenal medical communities to new levels. Rather than a matter of opinion, this is a ripe area for scientific inquiry. We challenge the renal community, as would be the case with any new classification system, to use tools of diagnostic statistics and to determine the predictive values of KDOQI staging within the different categories so that we can act and inform our patients appropriately.",2009,Kidney international

Mechanisms ofDNA Utilization byEstuarine Microbial Populations,"monophosphates hadno effect or stimulated [3H]DNAbinding, depending on the concentration. Theuptake ofradioactivity from[3H]DNAresulted inlittle accumulation oftrichloroacetic acid-soluble intracellular radioactivity andwas inhibited bytheDNA synthesis inhibitor novobiocin. Molecular fractionation studies indicated that some radioactivity from[3H]DNAappeared intheRNA (10and30%at4 and24h,respectively) andprotein (approximately 3%)fractions. Theability ofestuarine microbial assemblages totransport genesequenceswas investigated byplasmid uptake studies, followed bymolecular probing. Although plasmid DNA wasdetected on filters after filtration ofplasmid-amended incubations, DNase treatment offilters removed this DNA,indicating thatthere waslittle transport ofintact genesequences.These observations ledtothefollowing modelforDNA utilization byestuarine microbial populations.

(iii) DNA hydrolysis products aretransported, and(iv) theproducts arerapidly salvaged intonucleic acids, withlittle accumulation intointracellular nucleotide pools. Theutilization ofdissolved macromolecules byplanktonic microbial populations isan important yetpoorly understood routeforcarbon cycling intheoceans oftheworld(10). The ubiquitous presence ofdissolved DNA inplanktonic environments(5-7,19,24,25)invokes thequestion ofits utilization bynatural populations ofmarine bacteria.

Characteristics of mixed sporopollen assemblage from sediments of Dushanzi mud volcano in southern Junggar Basin and indication to the source of mud and debris ejecta,"In order to search for the source of muddy eruption debris, a series of erupted mud samples were collected from a corn of the Dushanzi mud volcanoes in southern Junggar Basin, NW China and analyzed for palynological records. Two palynomorph groups were revealed in the mixed sporopollen assemblage from the erupted sediments according to their colors. The light color group, accounting for about 95% of the total, was dominated by the Chenopodiaceae and Artemisia and in a color of faint yellow, indicating an immature stage of organic matter evolution. The dark color group was composed of Cyathidites, Classopollis, Schizaeoisporites, Lygodiumsporites and Rugubivesiculites, in a color of brown yellow, indicating a low maturity to maturity stage of organic matter evolution. The palynomorph records suggested that most of the muddy debris ejecta of the Dushanzi mud volcano might be sourced from the Cenozoic deposits, mainly the Middle-Late Miocene Taxihe and Dushanzi Formations, and a small portion likely from the Lower Cretaceous Tugulu Group. In addition, there is also a possibility that a little part of eruption debris is from the Upper Jurassic Qigu Formation. The Dushanzi anticline occurred strong extrusion and thrust faults in the late Himalayan period, and the oil and gas reservoirs were destroyed and resulted in eruption of the mud volcano in the Dushanzi area.",2018,Marine and Petroleum Geology
Changes in the concentration of free and collagen-bound hydroxyproline in muscle tissue of the bluehead wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum) as a function of age,"Abstract 1. 1. Marked increases occur in the concentration of free hydroxyproline in muscle tissue of the bluehead wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum) at approx 4 month intervals. 2. 2. For each 4 month interval, the time between the initial increase in free hydroxyproline concentration and occurrence of maximum concentration decreases with increasing age of the wrasse. Theoretcal implications are discussed. 3. 3. The soluble collagen-bound hydroxyproline data demonstrate that a trend exists whereby the concentration of this component decreases as a function of increasing age in the wrasse, whereas the insoluble collagen-bound hydroxyproline data indicate an opposite trend.",1980,Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology Part A: Physiology
La nuova normativa sismica italiana e tecniche di adeguamento.,"Il rischio e una misura di probabilita che quantifica lo stato di conoscenza di un fenomeno e la prevedibilita del danno conseguente ad un evento potenzialmente catastrofico. Nel caso delle strutture, il rischio sismico e la probabilita di collasso del sistema in un dato periodo di tempo in un certo luogo con assegnate proprieta sismo-genetiche. Il rischio sismico e definito dalla relazione: R=PxVxE dove P e la perieolosita sismica, definita come funzione probabilistica di un evento sismico, della sua intensita e del suo periodo di ritorno, V e la vulnerabilita sismica, che dipende dalla capacita delle costruzioni di rispondere alle sollecitazioni sismiche ed e misurata dal danno che la costruzione subisce a causa di un terremoto di un data intensita, mentre E e l'esposizione ed R e il rischio sismico, risultante dalla combinazione delle tre grandezze precedenti in un arco di tempo determinato ed e la misura dei danni che si possono riscontrare in un determinato intervallo di tempo. L'Italia e considerata un Paese ad elevato rischio sismico, in quanto le perdite attese a seguito di un terremoto sono elevate in termini di vittime, danni alle costruzioni e conseguenti costi diretti e indiretti. 
 La pericolosita sismica di un territorio e rappresentata dalla frequenza e dall'intensita dei terremoti che lo interessano, cioe dalla sua sismicita. [...] Alla pericolosita sismica italiana e attribuito un livello medio. 
 Si definisce vulnerabilita sismica la predisposizione di una costruzione a subire un danno di un determinato livello da un evento sismico di una data intensita. Quanto piu un edificio e vulnerabile (per tipologia, progettazione inadeguata, scadente qualita dei materiali e modalita di costruzione, scarsa manutenzione), tanto maggiori saranno le conseguenze sfavorevoli che avvengono a seguito alle oscillazioni a cui la struttura sara sottoposta. In Italia il rapporto tra i danni prodotti dai terremoti e l'energia effettivamente rilasciata e molto piu alto rispetto a quanto riscontrato in Paesi ad elevata sismicita (Giappone) a causa della fragilita del patrimonio edilizio, infrastrutturale, industriale, produttivo e delle reti dei servizi. La valutazione della vulnerabilita sismica richiede l'applicazione di modelli matematici complessi, capaci di simulare il comportamento delle strutture sottoposte a sollecitazioni sismiche e di valutarne la risposta anche in termini di singoli elementi e collegamenti. Per ridurre le perdite di vite umane, e necessario rendere sicure le strutture edilizie, specialmente quelle strategiche per evitare che subiscano danneggiamenti a causa di un forte terremoto. Oggi le norme per le costruzioni in zone sismiche prevedono che gli edifici non si danneggino per terremoti di bassa intensita, non subiscano danni strutturali per terremoti di media intensita e non crollino in occasione di terremoti forti, pur potendo subire gravi danni. Questi criteri sono finalizzati alla protezione degli occupanti e poi degli edifici, con costi economicamente ragionevoli. 
 Si definisce esposizione la maggiore o minore presenza di beni a rischio e, dunque, la conseguente possibilita di subire un danno (economico, in vite umane, ai beni culturali, ecc...). In Italia l'esposizione ha valori altissimi, a causa dell'alta densita abitativa e della presenza di un patrimonio storico, artistico e monumentale prezioso.",2010,
Traffic accident like suicide,"Tracheal injury is a rare pathology, but 30% of all cases can be fatal and 50% of those patients will deteriorate in a couple of hours and may lead to death. The course of treatment must be scheduled by clinical status and severity of pathology; conservative approaches can be followed for minor injuries, but major surgeries must be performed for advanced cases. A 28-year-old male, who suffered from caught with a lasso around the neck in a traffic accident, was brought to our emergency service from a distant medical facility. It has been observed that tracheal integrity was lost, subcutaneous and mediastinal emphysema were evident, and bilateral pneumothorax was significant, especially at right with thorax computed tomography. His clinical condition was bad. Tube thoracostomy placement was successfully achieved from the right side, and neck exploration was performed for tracheostomy in operating theater; a total tracheal rupture was observed between the level of 2 amd 3 cricoid cartilage, and the procedure was terminated after placing a tracheostomy cannula to the distal segment of trachea to wait for considering reconstruction following clinical progression and hemodynamic stabilization of the patient. Following the 7th day after the first operation, the patient was operated. The trachea was repaired by suturing using 3-0 polypropylene sutures. The patient was discharged after 12 h of intensive care and 5 days of follow-up in surgery service. Blunt tracheal injuries may not present any symptoms or signs but may also manifest dramatically. Mortality and morbidity rates may be drastically higher. For this reason, physical examination, radiological findings, and bronchoscopy should be performed early in diagnosis and the most appropriate treatment option that can prevent mortality should be decided quickly.",2019,Eurasian Journal of Pulmonology

Multi-target Tracking with Sparse Group Features and Position Using Discrete-Continuous Optimization,"Multi-target tracking of pedestrians is a challenging task due to uncertainty about targets, caused mainly by similarity between pedestrians, occlusion over a relatively long time and a cluttered background. A usual scheme for tackling multi-target tracking is to divide it into two sub-problems: data association and trajectory estimation. A reasonable approach is based on joint optimization of a discrete model for data association and a continuous model for trajectory estimation in a Markov Random Field framework. Nonetheless, usual solutions of the data association problem are based only on location information, while the visual information in the images is ignored. Visual features can be useful for associating detections with true targets more reliably, because the targets usually have discriminative features. In this work, we propose a combination of position and visual feature information in a discrete data association model. Moreover, we propose the use of group Lasso regularization in order to improve the identification of particular pedestrians, given that the discriminative regions are associated with particular visual blocks in the image. We find promising results for our approach in terms of precision and robustness when compared with a state-of-the-art method in standard datasets for multi-target pedestrian tracking.",2014,
InfÃ©rence non-paramÃ©trique pour des interactions poissoniennes,"L'objet de cette these est d'etudier divers problemes de statistique non-parametrique dans le cadre d'un modele d'interactions poissoniennes.

Dans ce cadre, nous introduisons une fonction dite de reproduction qui permet de quantifier les positions preferentielles des motifs et qui peut etre modelisee par l'intensite d'un processus de Poisson.

Des simulations et une application en genomique sur des donnees reelles provenant de la bacterie E. coli nous permettent de montrer le bon comportement pratique de notre procedure. Puis, nous traitons les problemes de test associes qui consistent a tester la nullite de la fonction de reproduction. Pour cela, nous construisons une procedure de test optimale du point de vue minimax sur des espaces de Besov faibles, qui a egalement montre ses performances du point de vue pratique.

Identify Predictive SNP groups in Genome Wide Association Study: A Sparse Learning Approach,"Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) aims to identify genetic variants that are significantly associated with genetic traits. To analyze GWAS data that often contains 0.5 to 1 million Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyped from thousands of individuals, stringent statistical significant thresholds are pre-defined for multiple testing adjustment, e.g., with p-value < 10 âˆ’8 for single SNP detection and at least < 10 âˆ’12 for SNP-SNP interaction detection. Such stringent thresholds were used for efficiency computation but it hinders the discovery of many true genetic variants and more practical approaches are needed to conduct GWAS. In this paper, we propose a machine learning approach to identify groups of predictive SNPs in GWAS analysis. Our method differs from other methods by first translates the genomics knowledge into SNP grouping as priors, then select a list of most predictive SNP groups using linear regression regularized by group sparse constraints, solved by Group-lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator). The selected SNPs groups compose a sparse feature space which yields a higher predictive power for continuous trait prediction. We conduct experiment on SiMES (Singapore Malay Eye Study) data set, with 3280 Malay individuals genotyped on Illumina 610 quad arrays. We investigate one discrete trait (Glaucoma) and two glaucoma-related quantitative traits, optic Disc-Cup-Ratio (CDR) and Intraocular Pressure (IOP). The hypothesis is that, with more biological knowledge embedded, a learning mechanism yields higher predictive power. Our preliminary results support the above hypothesis. Further analysis reveals that our approach can identify groups of SNPs highly associated with a particular genetic trait, in spite of the small sample size and the incomplete biological knowledge.",2012,
Tuning parameter selection for the adaptive LASSO in the autoregressive model,"Abstract We study the adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) for the sparse autoregressive model (AR). Here, the sparsity of the AR model implies some of the autoregression coefficients are exactly zero, that must be excluded from the AR model. We propose the modified Bayesian information criterion (MBIC) as a way of selecting an optimal tuning parameter for the adaptive LASSO, which must be the most critical point in using the adaptive LASSO for the AR model. We prove that the adaptive LASSO obtained by minimizing the MBIC correctly distinguishes the true autoregression coefficients from zero asymptotically. The results hold even when the numbers of zero and nonzero true autoregression coefficients are diverging to infinity and the minimum of the absolute values of nonzero true autoregression coefficients decreases toward zero as the sample size increases. A small number of numerical studies are conducted to confirm the theoretical results.",2017,Journal of The Korean Statistical Society

Sparse input matrix and state estimation for linear systems,"This paper addresses the problem of sparse identification of the input matrix parameters in linear systems. A filter that combines state and sparse input matrix estimation is developed.

The solution consistency is discussed and the technique is applied to experimental measurements from a production web server with promising results.",2010,49th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)
Regularized matrix regression.,"Modern technologies are producing a wealth of data with complex structures. For instance, in two-dimensional digital imaging, flow cytometry and electroencephalography, matrix-type covariates frequently arise when measurements are obtained for each combination of two underlying variables. To address scientific questions arising from those data, new regression methods that take matrices as covariates are needed, and sparsity or other forms of regularization are crucial owing to the ultrahigh dimensionality and complex structure of the matrix data. The popular lasso and related regularization methods hinge on the sparsity of the true signal in terms of the number of its non-zero coefficients. However, for the matrix data, the true signal is often of, or can be well approximated by, a low rank structure. As such, the sparsity is frequently in the form of low rank of the matrix parameters, which may seriously violate the assumption of the classical lasso. We propose a class of regularized matrix regression methods based on spectral regularization. A highly efficient and scalable estimation algorithm is developed, and a degrees-of-freedom formula is derived to facilitate model selection along the regularization path. Superior performance of the method proposed is demonstrated on both synthetic and real examples.",2014,"Journal of the Royal Statistical Society. Series B, Statistical methodology"
ModalitÃ©s de la rencontre entre la stase adulte de la tique Amblyomma variegatum (acari : Ixodida) et les bovins : applications potentielles Ã  la lutte contre ce parasite,"Les eleveurs traditionnels d'Afrique de l'ouest utilisent de plus en plus les acaricides pour lutter contre la stase adulte d'Amblyomma variegatum, la tique la plus nuisible pour les ruminants domestiques de la region. Or, ces produits sont couteux et leur emploi n'est pas sans risque. Dans la perspective d'identifier de nouvelles methodes de lutte qui permettraient de limiter le recours aux produits chimiques, les relations entre les bovins et la tique ont ete etudiees au cours d'experiences menees dans l'Adamaoua, au Cameroun, et autour de Bobo-Dioulasso, au Burkina Faso. Les travaux decrits ont plus particulierement porte sur trois points: identification des pÃ¢turages sur lesquels l'hote et le parasite entrent en contact; identification du processus d'envahissement des bovins par les tiques; etude de la variabilite de l'infestation des animaux. Il a ete observe que le comportement des bovins influencait leur niveau d'infestation qui resulte de plusieurs phenomenes differents: capture des tiques pendant les deplacements, attraction des parasites pendant: les phases de repos couche, elirnination plus ou moins importante des tiques fixees. Ces observations indiquent que la lutte par selection des animaux peu infestes, envisagee depuis de nombreuses annees, serait particulierement difficile a mettre en oeuvre La repartition des tiques sur les pÃ¢turages s'est revelee etre tres heterogene et les zones les plus infestees etaient egalement les plus frequentees: eviter les tiques semble donc impossible. En revanche, une meilleure gestion du pÃ¢turage sur les parcelles cultivees, frequentees par les bovins apres les recoltes, permettrait de reduire le nombre de nymphes gorgees disseminees sur les savanes, et donc la densite des tiques adultes. Il faudrait pour cela conduire les troupeaux sur les champs pendant l'apres-midi (entre 14h30 et 17h00), periode au cours de laquelle la quasi-totalite des nymphes gorgees se detache. Enfin, il a ete observe que les tiques capturees pendant les deplacements des bovins se fixent dans les espaces inter-digites et ne se deplacent pour sattacher sur les sites de predilection que lorsque les hotes se couchent. Une lutte par traitement cible des sites de fixation provisoire pourrait par consequent etre developpee. Un premier essai, encourageant, a ete realise a l'aide d'un pediluve. (Resume d'auteur)",2000,
Prediction of carcass composition and individual carcass cuts of Japanese Black steers.,"The objective of this study was to develop equations to predict carcass tissue weights and percentages and boneless carcass non-trimmed cut weights by using the cold carcass weight (CCW) and three other traits at the 6-7th rib section, which are routinely collected in carcass markets in Japan. Carcasses from 94 Japanese Black steers were used for the multiple regression analysis with a stepwise procedure and a novel Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO). The accuracies of prediction (R(2)) and RMSEs for the carcass tissue and cut weights were similar between the two procedures. In contrast, LASSO appeared to be the better procedure for predicting carcass tissue percentages. The longissimus muscle area and subcutaneous fat thickness were the important predictors for the lean percentage in the stepwise procedure, and CCW was additionally selected when the LASSO procedure was used.",2014,Meat science

Analysis of multiple exposures in the case-crossover design via sparse conditional likelihood.,"We adapt the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) and other sparse methods (elastic net and bootstrapped versions of lasso) to the conditional logistic regression model and provide a full R implementation. These variable selection procedures are applied in the context of case-crossover studies. We study the performances of conventional and sparse modelling strategies by simulations, then empirically compare results of these methods on the analysis of the association between exposure to medicinal drugs and the risk of causing an injurious road traffic crash in elderly drivers. Controlling the false discovery rate of lasso-type methods is still problematic, but this problem is also present in conventional methods. The sparse methods have the ability to provide a global analysis of dependencies, and we conclude that some of the variants compared here are valuable tools in the context of case-crossover studies with a large number of variables.",2012,Statistics in medicine
"Report on the Hypermobility Special Interest Group, British Society for Rheumatology meeting in Glasgow, April 1995.","PROFESSOR Grahame welcomed everybody to the third meeting of this special interest group that has run concurrently with the Annual General Meeting. The meeting was opened by Dr Ann Child, who gave a well-illustrated overview of her continued research interests into the microfibril glycoprotein fibrillin. There are now up to 40 fibrillin gene mutations in classical Marfan's syndrome. A recent study of Marfan's syndrome has demonstrated that both hypermobile and female subjects have a better long-term prognosis in respect to cardiovascular involvement than those subjects with stiff contracted joints. Increasing numbers of microfibril-associated proteins and mutations within them are being described each year. This has led to a group of parallel studies searching for fibrillin mutations in individuals who have features associated with Marfan's syndrome. These include the benign joint hypermobility syndrome, ectopia lends, mitral valve prolapse, congenital contractural arachnodactyly (Beal's syndrome) and scoliosis. Mutations have been identified in the fibrillin genes situated on chromosomes 5, 15, 17 in eight families with the benign joint hypermobility syndrome. A study of 90 consecutive patients with mitral valve prolapse revealed Marfanoid features in 75%, skeletal signs in 72%, skin extensibility in 58% and joint hypermobility syndrome in 5%. Up to 80% of Marfan's patients have some degree of lens dislocation and therefore a group of 11 families with dominantly inherited ectopia lentis were studied further. Significant joint hypermobility was seen in four families and mild mitral valve prolapse in four families. An associated mutation in the FBN1 gene has since been described in one of these ectopia lentis families. Defects in a second fibrillin gene, FBN2 (located on chromosome 5), have recently been demonstrated in congenital contractural arachnodactyly. A plea was made for referral of further cases so that this condition could be studied further. Scoliosis is frequently associated with Marfan's syndrome. The inheritance of 40 families with isolated scoliosis would appear to be dominant, but sex influenced, with reduced penetrance in up to one-third of family members. Joint hypermobility is found in one-third of these famines. Defective incorporation of fibrillin into the extracellular matrix was seen in four out of a subset of seven of these cases. Further linkage studies of genes in the fibrillin and elastin families are under way. Each year increased numbers of fibrilassociated proteins are discovered, which could also be candidates for linkage studies into the overlapping inherited connective tissue diseases. In discussion, Dr Paul Wordsworth again stressed the underlying problem of accurately denning the phenotype in this group of patients before linkage studies are performed, and Likened it to osteogenesis imperfecta where mild and severe cases frequently occur within one family. The second presentation, by Dr Lee Hardwick, gave an excellent overview of the principles behind linkage studies and the new methods available for speeding up this process. Three major types of genetic markers have been used over the last 10-15 yr, firstly restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs), then minisatelh'tes and, more recently, microsatellites. One disadvantage of using the tandom repeats of minisatelhtes is that they are not evenly distributed throughout the genome and are thus not closely associated with individual genes. The microsatellites (dinucleotide repeats) are situated between genes and are evenly distributed throughout the genome. This makes them highly informative and they are therefore the markers of choice. The polymerase chain reaction can be used to amplify dinucleotide repeats and therefore across specific regions of the genome. Fluorescent rather than radioactive tags are now available which enable automatic reading of computergenerated gel images, increasing the speed at which the genome can then be analysed. These new technologies have been used to revisit the collagen genes in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and possible linkage to the short arms of chromosomes 17, 7 and 2, which contain COL1A1, COL1A2 and COL1A3, respectively. It is now possible to use microsatellite repeats that span the whole genome to determine where the abnormal gene within these famines is segregating. There are plans to study further large families and it is hoped the precise linkage will soon be established.",1996,British journal of rheumatology
Sparse Correspondence Analysis,"Since the introduction of the lasso in regression, various sparse methods have been developped in an unsupervised context like sparsePCA which is a combination of feature selection and dimension reduction. Their interest is to simplify the interpretation of the pseudo principal components since each is expressed as a linear combination of only a small number of variables. The disadvantages lie on the one hand in the difficulty of choosing the number of non-zero coefficients in the absence of a criterion and on the other hand in the loss of orthogonality properties for the components and/or the loadings. In this paper we are interested in sparse variants of correspondence analysis (CA) for large contingency tables like documents-terms matrices. We use the fact that CA is both a PCA (or a weighted SVD) and a canonical analysis, in order to develop column sparse CA and rows and columns doubly sparse CA.",2019,

ACOs with risk-bearing experience are likely taking steps to reduce low-value medical services.,"OBJECTIVES
Accountable care organizations (ACOs) are groups of healthcare providers responsible for quality of care and spending for a defined patient population. The elimination of low-value medical services will improve quality and reduce costs and, therefore, ACOs should actively work to reduce the use of low-value services. We set out to identify ACO characteristics associated with implementation of strategies to reduce overuse.


STUDY DESIGN
Survey analysis.


METHODS
We used the National Survey of ACOs to determine the percentage of responding ACOs aware of the Choosing Wisely campaign and to what degree ACOs have taken steps to reduce the use of low-value services. We identified characteristics of ACOs associated with implementing low-value care-reducing strategies using 3 statistical models (stepwise and LASSO logistic regression and random forest).


RESULTS
Responding executives of 155 of 267 ACOs (58%) were aware of Choosing Wisely. Eighty-four of those 155Â ACO leaders said that their ACOs also actively implemented strategies to reduce the use of low-value services, largely through educating physicians and stimulating shared decision making. All 3 models identified the presence of at least 1 commercial payer contract and prior joint experience pursuing risk-based payment contracts as the most important predictors of an ACO actively implementing strategies to reduce low-value care.


CONCLUSIONS
In the first year of implementation, just one-third of ACOs had taken steps to reduce the use of low-value medical services. Safety-net ACOs and those with little experience as a risk-bearing organization need more time and support from healthcare payers and the Choosing Wisely campaign to prioritize the reduction of overuse.",2018,The American journal of managed care
Risk assessment models for genetic risk predictors of lung cancer using two-stage replication for Asian and European populations,"In the past ten years, great successes have been accumulated by taking advantage of both candidate-gene studies and genome-wide association studies. However, limited studies were available to systematically evaluate the genetic effects for lung cancer risk with large-scale and different ethnic populations. We systematically reviewed relevant literatures and filtered out 241 important genetic variants identified in 124 articles. A two-stage case-control study within specific subgroups was performed to assess the effects [Training set: 2,331 cases vs. 3,077 controls (Chinese population); testing set: 1,937 cases vs. 1,984 controls (European population)]. Variable selection and model development were used LASSO penalized regression and genetic risk score (GRS) system. Further change in area under the receiver operator characteristic curves (AUC) made by the epidemiologic model with and without GRS was used to compare predictions. It kept 38 genetic variants in our study and the ratios of lung cancer risk for subjects in the upper quartile GRS was three times higher compared to that in the low quartile (odds ratio: 4.64, 95% CI: 3.87-5.56). In addition, we found that adding genetic predictors to smoking risk factor-only model improved lung cancer predictive value greatly: AUC, 0.610 versus 0.697 (P < 0.001). Similar performance was derived in European population and the combined two data sets. Our findings suggested that genetic predictors could improve the predictive ability of risk model for lung cancer and highlighted the application among different populations, indicating that the lung cancer risk assessment model will be a promising tool for high risk population screening and prediction.",2017,Oncotarget
Adaptive JIT-Lasso modeling for online application of near infrared spectroscopy,"Abstract Near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy has been widely employed as a non-invasive analytical tool in industry. However, most NIR model are built offline which cannot address changes in process characteristics as well as nonlinearity. To solve this problem, an adaptive JIT-Lasso algorithm was proposed by merging the least absolute shrinkage and the selection operator (Lasso) algorithm into just-in-time (JIT) learning. A time-space similarity measure criterion that combined temporal relevance and spatial relevance was used to further improve the performance of the JIT-Lasso algorithm. This solved both the space nonlinearity and the time-varying issue of the process simultaneously. The proposed model updating approach not only solved the nonlinear and the time-varying issues based on JIT learning framework, but also reduced the computational complexity and improved the model interpretability through Lasso. The effectiveness of the method was demonstrated on a spectroscopic dataset from an industrial petroleum desalination process. Compared with traditional partial least squares, kernel partial least square, locally weighted partial least squares, locally weighted kernel partial least squares,the proposed method achieves better performance.",2018,Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems

Incorporating prior knowledge into Gene Network Study,"MOTIVATION
A major goal in genomic research is to identify genes that may jointly influence a biological response. From many years of intensive biomedical research, a large body of biological knowledge, or pathway information, has accumulated in available databases. There is a strong interest in leveraging these pathways to improve the statistical power and interpretability in studying gene networks associated with complex phenotypes. This prior information is a valuable complement to large-scale genomic data such as gene expression data generated from microarrays. However, it is a non-trivial task to effectively integrate available biological knowledge into gene expression data when reconstructing gene networks.


RESULTS
In this article, we developed and applied a Lasso method from a Bayesian perspective, a method we call prior Lasso (pLasso), for the reconstruction of gene networks. In this method, we partition edges between genes into two subsets: one subset of edges is present in known pathways, whereas the other has no prior information associated. Our method assigns different prior distributions to each subset according to a modified Bayesian information criterion that incorporates prior knowledge on both the network structure and the pathway information. Simulation studies have indicated that the method is more effective in recovering the underlying network than a traditional Lasso method that does not use the prior information. We applied pLasso to microarray gene expression datasets, where we used information from the Pathway Commons (PC) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) as prior information for the network reconstruction, and successfully identified network hub genes associated with clinical outcome in cancer patients.

Atrial fibrillation ablation: importance of cavotricuspid isthmus block.,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE
Maintenance of atrial fibrillation (AF) depends on the presence of multiple reentrant circuits in the atria. In AF ablation, after pulmonary vein (PV) isolation, substrate modification can be increased by performing linear lesions in the left atrium that reduce the fibrillatory surface. A cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) block may be an easier and safer alternative to left atrial lines for this purpose. Non-inducibility after AF ablation is associated with a higher success rate. The aim of this study is to assess whether CTI ablation after PV isolation reduces inducibility of atrial arrhythmias, particularly AF.


METHODS AND RESULTS
In 29 consecutive patients (23 male, mean age 54.6+/-11.4 years, 11 (38%) with hypertension and four (14%) with structural heart disease, mean left atrial dimension 43+/-6 mm) undergoing PV isolation for paroxysmal or persistent AF, atrial arrhythmia inducibility was tested before and after CTI ablation. The procedure was performed using a CARTO-Merge mapping system, one or two Lasso catheters, an irrigated ablation catheter and radiofrequency energy. Atrial arrhythmia inducibility was tested with burst pacing down to 150 ms or atrial refractoriness from the proximal coronary sinus. Atrial arrhythmias were considered inducible if they persisted for more than 60 seconds. Of the 29 patients, 26 (90%) had an inducible arrhythmia before CTI ablation--AF in 16, typical atrial flutter (AFL) in seven and atypical AFL in three. Three (10%) were non-inducible. After CTI ablation, only 11 patients (38%) maintained arrhythmia inducibility (p<0.001)--AF in nine and atypical AFL in two. There was a significant reduction of AF inducibility (16 vs. 9/29, p=0.016) and of combined AF and atypical AFL inducibility (19 vs. 11/29, p=0.021). After one year of follow-up, 23 patients (79%) had no recurrence of arrhythmia. Success rates were 83% in patients without and 73% in patients with inducible arrhythmias at the end of the procedure (p=NS).


CONCLUSION
CTI ablation, in addition to PV isolation, significantly reduced the number of patients with inducible atrial arrhythmias and inducible AF.",2009,Revista portuguesa de cardiologia : orgao oficial da Sociedade Portuguesa de Cardiologia = Portuguese journal of cardiology : an official journal of the Portuguese Society of Cardiology

"Knowledge, Attitudes and Contraceptive Practices among Young People from the Youth Listening Center of the BurkinabÃ¨â€™s Family Well-Being Association in Bobo-Dioulasso City","Objective: To study the knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding contraception among young people in the Burkinabeâ€™s family well-being association for youth listening center in Bobo-Dioulasso city. Methods: This was a survey of 635 clients in the youth listeningâ€™s center of Bobo-Dioulasso city, Burkina Faso. These clients were gradually included by random choice from January 15 to April 15, 2018. The data were collected by self-administered written questionnaire under the supervision of an investigator and after a free and informed verbal agreement of the participant. The analysis was done using the software Epi info version 7.1.1.0. Results: The average age of the respondents was 20.62 years. Female respondents were more numerous, 508 (80%). Contraceptive methods were known by 98.12% of respondents and 61.42% said they were always using them. Two-thirds of clients (67%) cited at least two benefits of contraceptive methods which were correct. Condoms were the best-known method (92.60%) and also the most used (92.56%). But emergency contraception was known by 30.71% of participants. Young people who were already sexually active accounted for 73.54% of the sample with a mean age at their first sexual intercourse of 18.42 years. Conclusion: The majority of respondents knew contraceptive methods. However, risky sexual behaviors and misconceptions about contraception remain. The setting up of family planning services within schools and the teaching of a reproductive health module in all secondary schools will contribute to improve their sexual and reproductive health.",2019,Open Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology
Feature selection with the Fisher score followed by the Maximal Clique Centrality algorithm can accurately identify the hub genes of hepatocellular carcinoma,"This study aimed to select the feature genes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with the Fisher score algorithm and to identify hub genes with the Maximal Clique Centrality (MCC) algorithm. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis was performed to examine the enrichment of terms. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to identify the classes of genes that are overrepresented. Following the construction of a protein-protein interaction network with the feature genes, hub genes were identified with the MCC algorithm. The Kaplanâ€“Meier plotter was utilized to assess the prognosis of patients based on expression of the hub genes. The feature genes were closely associated with cancer and the cell cycle, as revealed by GO, KEGG and GSEA enrichment analyses. Survival analysis showed that the overexpression of the Fisher scoreâ€“selected hub genes was associated with decreased survival time (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), Lasso, ReliefF and random forest were used for comparison with the Fisher score algorithm. The comparison among these approaches showed that the Fisher score algorithm is superior to the Lasso and ReliefF algorithms in terms of hub gene identification and has similar performance to the WGCNA and random forest algorithms. Our results demonstrated that the Fisher score followed by the application of the MCC algorithm can accurately identify hub genes in HCC.",2019,Scientific Reports
Rival Representations of Decision Problems,"A transformative decision rule alters the representation of a decisionproblem, either by changing the sets of acts and states taken intoconsideration, or by modifying the probability or value assignments.Examples of decision rules belonging to this class are the principleof insufficient reason, Isaac Leviâ€™s condition of E-admissibility, Luceand Raiffaâ€™s merger of states-rule, and the de minimis principle. Inthis doctoral thesis transformative decision rules are analyzed froma foundational point of view, and applied to two decision theoreticalproblems: (i) How should a rational decision maker model a decisionproblem in a formal representation (â€˜problem specificationâ€™, â€˜formaldescriptionâ€™)? (ii) What role can transformative decision rules play inthe justification of the principle of maximizing expected utility?The thesis consists of a summary and seven papers. In Papers Iand II certain foundational issues concerning transformative decisionrules are investigated, and a number of formal properties of this classof rules are proved: convergence, iterativity, and permutability. InPaper III it is argued that there is in general no unique representationof a decision problem that is strictly better than all alternative representations.In Paper IV it is shown that the principle of maximizingexpected utility can be decomposed into a sequence of transformativedecision rules. A set of axioms is proposed that together justify theprinciple of maximizing expected utility. It is shown that the suggestedaxiomatization provides a resolution of Allaisâ€™ paradox that cannot beobtained by Savage-style, nor by von Neumann and Morgenstern-styleaxiomatizations. In Paper V the axiomatization from Paper IV is furtherelaborated, and compared to the axiomatizations proposed byvon Neumann and Morgenstern, and Savage. The main results in PaperVI are two impossibility theorems for catastrophe averse decisionrules, demonstrating that given a few reasonable desiderata for suchrules, there is no rule that can fulfill the proposed desiderata. In PaperVII transformative decision rules are applied to extreme risks, i.e.to a potential outcome of an act for which the probability is low, butwhose (negative) value is high.",2010,
Simple principal component analysis using Lasso,"In this study, a simple principal component analysis using Lasso is proposed. This method consists of two steps. The first step is to compute principal components by the principal component analysis. The second step is to regress each principal component on the original data matrix by Lasso regression method. Each of new principal components is computed as the linear combination of original data matrix using the scaled estimated Lasso regression coefficient as the coefficients of the combination. This method leads to easily interpretable principal components with more 0 coefficients by the properties of Lasso regression models. This is because the estimator of the regression of each principal component on the original data matrix is the corresponding eigenvector. This method is applied to real and simulated data sets with the help of an R package for Lasso regression and its usefulness is demonstrated.",2013,
The Chymotrypsin-catalyzed Hydrolysis and Synthesis of IV-Acetvbtvrosine,"The formation of an acyl-enzyme intermediate has been demonstrated in the chymotrypsin-catalyzed hydrolysis of activated acyl compounds (1) such as acyl chlorides, p-nitrophenyl esters, anhydrides, and acylimidazoles, as well as with alkyl esters of cinnamic acid (2) and N-acetyltryptophan (3). There is, however, no direct evidence indicating that a similar intermediate is formed in the hydrolysis of unactivated peptide-like substrates, such as amides, peptides, hydrosamic acids, or acylhydrazides. Bernhard, Coles, and Nowell (4) have concluded from a kinetic argument that the chymotrypsin-catalyzed hydrolysis and hydrosylaminolysis of methyl hippurate do not proceed through an ac)-l-enzyme intermediate, and Bender and Glasson (5) have reported results similar to those upon which Bernhard et al. base their conclusion, for the hydrolysis and methanolysis of N-acetylL-phenylalanine methyl ester. Recently, Epand and Wilson (6) have shown that a number of different hippurate esters give the same yield of hydroxamic acid in the presence of chymotrypsin and a constant concentration of hydroxylamine. If it is assumed that a direct reaction of hydroxylamine with different enzymebound esters would give different yields of hydroxamic acid, this is evidence that a common acyl-enzyme intermediate is formed in these reactions.â€™ The demonstration of an acyl-enzyme intermediate in the hydrolysis of peptide-like substrates would be expected to be difficult, because the thermodynamic barrier to formation of an acylenzyme involving an ester linkage would probably prevent the accumulation of detectable quantities of this intermediate. Furthermore, enzymatic hydrolysis of unactivated peptide-like substrates has been found to occur only with substrates which would be expected to form extremely labile acyl-enzymes, as estimated",2003,
[Patient complaints: an opportunity to improve the quality of care of older people with multimorbidity in Burkina Faso].,"Introduction
Little data exist on patient complaints to identify the strategy for the improvement of the quality of care of older people with multimorbidities. The aim of this study was to investigate the complaints of older people with multimorbidities at the health care facilities in Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso.


Methods
We conducted a cross-sectional study in the health care facilities in Bobo-Dioulasso from November 2013 to February 2014. Older people aged 60 years or more, with at least a chronic disease, examined in ambulatory or in hospital during the study period were included. Qualitative interviews were conducted using a semi-structured questionnaire. A content analysis was performed.


Results
We recorded the complaints related to long waiting time for health care, unsuitable hospital transfer service, lack of shared information on diseases and unsuitable hospitality conditions for older patients come to consultation and hospitalization.


conclusion
Improvement strategies should include the renovation and extension of the waiting rooms in the health care facilities, the separation of chronic care practice from acute care practice in ambulatory and in hospital, the support to the empowerment through a better communication with the patient, a community mutual assistance group and the involvement of family members.",2017,The Pan African medical journal
Triple categorical regression for genomic selection: application to cassava breeding,"Genome-wide selection (GWS) is currently a technique of great importance in plant breeding, since it improves efficiency of genetic evaluations by increasing genetic gains. The process is based on genomic estimated breeding values (GEBVs) obtained through phenotypic and dense marker genomic information. In this context, GEBVs of N individuals are calculated through appropriate models, which estimate the effect of each marker on phenotypes, allowing the early identification of genetically superior individuals. However, GWS leads to statistical challenges, due to high dimensionality and multicollinearity problems. These challenges require the use of statistical methods to approach the regularization of the estimation process. Therefore, we aimed to propose a method denominated as triple categorical regression (TCR) and compare it with the genomic best linear unbiased predictor (G-BLUP) and Bayesian least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (BLASSO) methods that have been widely applied to GWS. The methods were evaluated in simulated populations considering four different scenarios. Additionally, a modification of the G-BLUP method was proposed based on the TCR-estimated (TCR/G-BLUP) results. All methods were applied to real data of cassava (Manihot esculenta) with to increase efficiency of a current breeding program. The methods were compared through independent validation and efficiency measures, such as prediction accuracy, bias, and recovered genomic heritability. The TCR method was suitable to estimate variance components and heritability, and the TCR/G-BLUP method provided efficient GEBV predictions. Thus, the proposed methods provide new insights for GWS.",2019,Scientia Agricola
Using Modified Lasso Regression to Learn Large Undirected Graphs in a Probabilistic Framework,"Learning the structures of large undirected graphs with thousands of nodes from data has been an open challenge. In this paper, we use graphical Gaussian model (GGM) as the underlying model and propose a novel ARD style Wishart prior for the precision matrix of the GGM. which encodes the graph structure we want to learn. With this prior, we can get the MAP estimation of the precision matrix by solving (a modified version of) Lasso regressions and achieve a sparse solution. We use our approach to learn genetic regulatory networks from genome-wide expression microarray data and protein-binding location analysis data. Evaluated on the basis of consistency with the GO annotations, the experiments show that our approach has a much better performance than the clustering-based approaches and BN learning approaches in discovering gene regulatory modules.",2005,
Sparsity-Cognizant Total Least-Squares for Perturbed Compressive Sampling,"Solving linear regression problems based on the total least-squares (TLS) criterion has well-documented merits in various applications, where perturbations appear both in the data vector as well as in the regression matrix. However, existing TLS approaches do not account for sparsity possibly present in the unknown vector of regression coefficients. On the other hand, sparsity is the key attribute exploited by modern compressive sampling and variable selection approaches to linear regression, which include noise in the data, but do not account for perturbations in the regression matrix. The present paper fills this gap by formulating and solving (regularized) TLS optimization problems under sparsity constraints. Near-optimum and reduced-complexity suboptimum sparse (S-) TLS algorithms are developed to address the perturbed compressive sampling (and the related dictionary learning) challenge, when there is a mismatch between the true and adopted bases over which the unknown vector is sparse. The novel S-TLS schemes also allow for perturbations in the regression matrix of the least-absolute selection and shrinkage selection operator (Lasso), and endow TLS approaches with ability to cope with sparse, under-determined â€œerrors-in-variablesâ€ models. Interesting generalizations can further exploit prior knowledge on the perturbations to obtain novel weighted and structured S-TLS solvers. Analysis and simulations demonstrate the practical impact of S-TLS in calibrating the mismatch effects of contemporary grid-based approaches to cognitive radio sensing, and robust direction-of-arrival estimation using antenna arrays.",2011,IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing
Restarting the accelerated coordinate descent method with a rough strong convexity estimate,"We propose new restarting strategies for the accelerated coordinate descent method. Our main contribution is to show that for a well chosen sequence of restarting times, the restarted method has a nearly geometric rate of convergence. A major feature of the method is that it can take profit of the local quadratic error bound of the objective function without knowing the actual value of the error bound. We also show that under the more restrictive assumption that the objective function is strongly convex, any fixed restart period leads to a geometric rate of convergence. Finally, we illustrate the properties of the algorithm on a regularized logistic regression problem and on a Lasso problem.",2020,Computational Optimization and Applications
"A New Miniature Rivuline Fish from the Upper Negro River Basin, Northern Brazil (teleostei, Cypridontiformes, Rivulidae) 1","2 ABSTRACT: Rivulus romeri sp.nov. is described from a small stream tributary of Igarape Iauiari, upper Negro river drainage, Amazonian basin, northern Brazil. It seems to be closely related to R. atratus Garman, 1895 and R. ornatus Garman, 1895 by all sharing apomorphic frontal squamation and head color pattern. It is diagnosed by the long and pointed anal fin of male, also present in R. gransabanae Lasso, Taphorn & Thomerson, 1992, and constitutes the smallest species of the genus.

The role of symmetries in adiabatic quantum algorithms,"Exploiting the similarity between adiabatic quantum algorithms and quantum phasetransitions, we argue that second-order transitions - typically associated with broken orrestored symmetries - should be advantageous in comparison to first-order transitions.Guided by simple examples we construct an alternative adiabatic algorithm for the NPcompleteproblem Exact Cover 3. We show numerically that its average performance (forthe considered cases up to O{20} qubits) is better than that of the conventional scheme.The run-time of adiabatic algorithms is not just determined by the minimum value of thefundamental energy gap (between the ground state and the exited states), but also byits curvature at the critical point. The proposed symmetry-restoring adiabatic quantumalgorithm only contains contributions linear and quadratic in the Pauli matrices and canbe generalized to other problem Hamiltonians which are decomposed of terms involvingone and two qubits. We show how the factoring problem can be cast into such a quadraticform. These findings suggest that adiabatic quantum algorithms can solve a large classof NP problems much faster than the Grover search routine (which corresponds to afirst-order transition and yields a quadratic enhancement only).",2010,Quantum Information & Computation
The necessity of multi-disciplinary scholarship for finance: On Ayache and Roffe,"Ayache presents a view of markets and mathematics that attempts to conform to the philosophies of Alain Badiou and Quentin Meillassoux. However, this attempt is unsuccessful because Ayache adopts a view of probability rooted in nineteenth-century conceptions that cannot accommodate the radical uncertainty of the markets. This is unfortunate as it is reasonable to believe that the ideas of Badiou and Meillassoux, when synthesised with contemporary ideas of probability, could offer interesting insights. Roffe presents a better argued synthesis of Deleuze and markets, however he makes similar assumptions about contemporary probability that undermine his conclusions.",2016,
A Novel Predictive Method Incorporating Parameters of Main Pulmonary Artery Bifurcation for Short-Term Prognosis in Non-high-risk Acute Pulmonary Embolism Patients,"The aim of this study was to build a formula to predict short-term prognosis using main pulmonary artery (MPA) parameters reconstructed from computed tomographic pulmonary angiography in non-high-risk acute pulmonary embolism (PE) patients. After reconstructing the MPA and its centerline, the MPA, the right and left pulmonary artery inlet, and the MPA outlet plane were differentiated to measure the cross-sectional area (CSA), the maximal diameter and the hydraulic diameter. The MPA bifurcation area, volume and angle were measured. MPA dilation was defined as >29 mm at the transverse section plane. The patients were randomly divided into a training set and a validation set. A least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression algorithm was used to build a predictive formula. The performances of the predictive formula from LASSO were tested by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and precision-recall (PR) curve with 10-fold cross-validation. The clinical utility was assessed by decision curve analysis (DCA). In total, 296 patients were enrolled and randomly divided (50:50) into a training set and a validation set. The LASSO predictive formula (lambda.1SE) was as follows: 0.92 Ã— MPA bifurcation area + 0.50 Ã— MPA outlet hydraulic diameter + 0.10 Ã— MPA outlet CSA. The AUCs of the predictive formula were 0.860 (95% CI: 0.795â€“0.912) and 0.943 (95% CI: 0.892â€“0.975) in the training set and validation set, respectively. The LASSO predictive formula had a higher average area under the PR curve than MPA dilation (0.71 vs. 0.23 in the training set and 0.55 vs. 0.23 in the validation set) and added a net benefit in clinical utility by DCA. Integration of MPA outlet CSA, hydraulic diameter, and bifurcation area with the LASSO predictive formula as a novel weighting method facilitated the prediction of poor short-term prognosis within 30 days after hospital admission in non-high-risk acute PE patients.",2020,
$L_1$-Penalization in Functional Linear Regression with Subgaussian Design,"We study functional regression with random subgaussian design and real-valued response. The focus is on the problems in which the regression function can be well approximated by a functional linear model with the slope function being ""sparse"" in the sense that it can be represented as a sum of a small number of well separated ""spikes"". This can be viewed as an extension of now classical sparse estimation problems to the case of infinite dictionaries. We study an estimator of the regression function based on penalized empirical risk minimization with quadratic loss and the complexity penalty defined in terms of $L_1$-norm (a continuous version of LASSO). The main goal is to introduce several important parameters characterizing sparsity in this class of problems and to prove sharp oracle inequalities showing how the $L_2$-error of the continuous LASSO estimator depends on the underlying sparsity of the problem.",2013,arXiv: Statistics Theory
Extended Lagrangian Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics with dissipation.,"Stability and dissipation in the propagation of the electronic degrees of freedom in time-reversible extended Lagrangian Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics [Niklasson et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 123001 (2006); Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 123004 (2008)] are analyzed. Because of the time-reversible propagation the dynamics of the extended electronic degrees of freedom is lossless with no dissipation of numerical errors. For long simulation times under ""noisy"" conditions, numerical errors may therefore accumulate to large fluctuations. We solve this problem by including a dissipative external electronic force that removes noise while keeping the energy stable. The approach corresponds to a Langevin-like dynamics for the electronic degrees of freedom with internal numerical error fluctuations and external, approximately energy conserving, dissipative forces. By tuning the dissipation to balance the numerical fluctuations the external perturbation can be kept to a minimum.",2009,The Journal of chemical physics
iTrade: A Mobile Data-Driven Stock Trading System with Concept Drift Adaptation,"Among all investors in the Chinese stock market, more than 95% are non-professional individual investors. These individual investors are in great need of mobile apps that can provide professional and handy trading analysis and decision support everywhere. However, financial data is challenging to analyze because of its large-scale, non-linear and noisy characteristics in a varying stock environment. This paper develops a Mobile Data-Driven Stock Trading System (iTrade), which is a mobile app system based on Client-Server architecture and various data mining techniques. The iTrade is characterized by 1) a data-driven intelligent learning model, which can provide further insight compared to empirical technical analysis, 2) a concept drift adaptation process, which facilitates the model adaptation to market structure changes, and 3) a rigorous benchmark analysis, including the Buy-and-Hold strategy and the strategies of three world-famous master investors (e.g., Warren E. Buffett). Technologies used in iTrade include the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Lasso) algorithm, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and risk-adjusted portfolio optimization. An application case of iTrade is presented, which is based on a seven-year (2005-2011) back-testing. Evaluation results indicated that iTrade could gain much higher cumulative return compared to the benchmark (Shanghai Composite Index). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study and mobile app system that emphasizes and investigates the concept drift phenomenon in stock market, as well as the performance comparison between data-driven intelligent model and strategies of master investors.",2015,IJDWM
Investigation of factors affecting the intelligence quotient (IQ) of intellectually disabled children and adolescents using modern regression approaches,"Abstract 
Background: Research shows that in addition to biological factors, psychological and social risk factors play a role in the development of intellectual disability. 
Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the familial, personal and educational factors affecting the intelligence quotient (IQ) levels of intellectually disabled children and adolescents via regularized regression approaches (RRAs) and to compare the results with those of conventional regression approach (CRA). 
Methods: A total of sixty characteristics were examined along with dummy variables of 205 children and adolescents selected according to the study protocol. Compact, Lasso, Ridge and Ridged Lasso RRAs were used in the dataset. 
Results: The optimal model was obtained with the Lasso approach and contained ten risk factors having a significant effect on IQ levels: diagnosis of cerebral palsy, age at onset of speech, duration of education, age at onset of walking, presence of elimination disorders, presence of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, family income, and number of siblings, residence and age. The RRAs provided opportunity to examine more factors than CRAs without requiring the fulfillment of strict CRA assumptions. 
Conclusions: Due to the advantages of RRAs, expanding their clinical usage for very large datasets was recommended. [Ethiop. J. Health Dev. 2018;32(1):21-28]

Effectiveness of epidural analgesia in enhanced recovery protocols following colorectal surgery,"s / International Journal of Surgery 12 (2014) S13eS117 S30 0645: EFFECTIVENESS OF EPIDURAL ANALGESIA IN ENHANCED RECOVERY PROTOCOLS FOLLOWING COLORECTAL SURGERY Anshi A. Dattani, Philip H. Pucher, Sam Coulson, Ann-Marie Howell, Paul Ziprin, Alison Knaggs. St Mary's Hospital, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London, UK. Introduction: Epidural anaesthesia is a key component of enhanced recovery care following colorectal surgery. Implementation in published literature is variable, with little UK-specific data. We report retrospective data from an academic tertiary centre on the success and effectiveness of epidurals over a three-year period. Methods: All patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery were identified over a five-month period from January 2011. Following implementation of several process improvement measures, a second cohort was assessed from July 2013. Epidural failure rates and incidence of epiduralassociated complications were recorded from patient records. Results: A total of 72 patients were included. The epidural failure rate did not improve between cohorts (45% vs. 55% pre and post-intervention) despite measures to improve implementation. There was a higher rate of conversion to patient-controlled analgesia following epidural failure (15.7% vs. 47.4% pre and post-intervention), with the remainder converting to oral analgesia. There was no statistically significant difference between post-operative pneumonia rate in patients with epidural failure vs. no failure in 2013 [13.3% (2/15) vs. 11.8% (2/19) (p1â„40.801)]. Conclusions: Epidural anaesthesia has a high failure rate. Failure is not associated with increased post-operative pneumonia risk. Our study concurs with recent international data suggesting limited effectiveness of epidurals. A more selective use in high-risk patients may be considered in future. 0656: A COMPARATIVE AUDIT OF OUTCOME AFTER LAPAROSCOPIC AND OPEN COLECTOMY FOR COLITIS Marina Diament , Janice Miller, Fiona Leitch , James Mander . Western General Hospital, Edinburgh, UK; Crosshouse Hospital, Kilmarnock, UK. Introduction: To compare the outcome of laparoscopic-assisted and open colectomy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in a specialist colorectal unit. Methods: All patients undergoing colectomy for IBD between 2009 and 2012 were identified from a prospectively maintained electronic database. Length of stay, mortality and morbidity including ileus, infection, bowel obstruction, respiratory failure and venous thromboembolism were compared. Results: 80 patients underwent colectomy from 2009 to 2012, 48 as emergencies. Hospital stay was 5 days shorter in the laparoscopic group. There was 1 death after open operation. The overall morbidity was 69% in the open and 44% in the laparoscopic group. Wound infection and ileus were the commonest complications with both significantly lower in the laparoscopic assisted group, p1â„40.007 and p1â„40.048 respectively. Conclusions: Laparoscopic colorectal resection is increasingly employed across the whole spectrum of coloproctology. This retrospective audit of an unselected cohort of IBD patients undergoing colectomy laparoscopic operations had a lower morbidity, lower mortality and shorter hospital stay. Laparoscopic colectomy for elective and emergency presentations of IBD is feasible and promising however further prospective study including detailed aspects of case selection for laparoscopic resection would be valuable before advocating a policy of laparoscopic resection for all patients. 0660: SURVIVAL OF PATIENTS WITH ISOLATED PERITONEAL CARCINOMATOSIS FROM COLORECTAL CANCER: 23 YEARS EXPERIENCE USING CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT Lewis Taylor, Umar Shariff, Alex Coupland, Haney Youssef, John Glaholm. Good Hope Hospital, Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham, UK. Introduction: Peritoneal metastasis (PM-CRC) the absence of distant metastases occurs in 3-10% of colorectal cancer cases. Survival rates are poor with conventional treatments, leading to more radical strategies incorporating cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and Heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC). This study aimed to investigate survival of patients with isolated PM-CRC prior to introduction of CRS/HIPEC. Methods: Data on demographics, treatments and survival for patients in our hospital with PM-CRC (synchronous/metachronous) were collected retrospectively (1989-2012). Patients with other distant metastases were excluded. Results: Of 40 patients with PM-CRC; complete data was available for 36. Median age 65 years (33-80 years); M(56%):F(44%). 24/36(66.7%) underwent surgical resection plus post-operative chemotherapy, 9/36(25%) had chemotherapy only, 3/36(8.3%) had surgical resection only. Medial survival following surgery plus chemotherapy: 23 months, chemotherapy only: 6 months, surgery only: 7.5 months. Kaplan-Meier predicted overall 1,2,3 and 5 year survival: 66.7%, 37.0%, 18.5% and 3.7% respectively. Overall median survival: 19.5 months (0-79 months). Conclusions: PM-CRC survival is poor using conventional treatments. Several published series using CRS/HIPEC have reported better outcomes using this radical treatment strategy for selected patients. This data provides a crucial baseline for comparison of survival of patient with PM-CRC prior to the introduction of CRS/HIPEC in our unit. 0666: ENDOSCOPIC TATTOOING OF COLORECTAL CANCERS AND RESECTION MARGINS Rebecca Lisseter, Claire Livsey, Nelson Wong, Peter Coyne, Ben Griffiths. Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK. Introduction: To assess tattooing of colorectal cancer and resection margins. Methods: Surgically resected colorectal carcinomas from June 2012 to August 2013were included. Histology reports were examined for resection margins. Results: 52 patients were included (32 male, 20 female, aged 45-88 years). 37 (71%) had tumour in the left colon and 16 (29%) were tattooed. In tattooed tumours 37.5% of resection margins were more than 5cm (range 3.290mm, mean 38mm, median 27mm). In non-tattooed tumours 23.8% of resection margins were more than 5cm (range 4-300mm, mean 40mm, median 20mm, P 1â„4 0.19). 15 (12%) had tumour in the right colon and 11 (74%) were tattooed. In tattooed tumours 72.7% of resection margins were more than 5cm (range 30-118mm, mean 64mm, median 50mm). In nontattooed tumours 75% of resection margins were more than 5cm (range 30-65mm, mean 55mm, median 57mm, P 1â„4 0.46). Conclusions: For left sided lesions, the percentage of resections with more than 5cm clearance was higher in tattooed lesions. Although not statistically significant, this is likely due to sample size. For right sided lesions the resectionmargins were very similar. More consistent tattooing of left sided colonic lesions will aid surgical resection with good margins. 0693: EROSION AFTER LAPAROSCOPIC VENTRAL MESH RECTOPEXY Collins Ekere, Krishnan Subramanian , Michael Lamparelli , Andrew Clarke .

Fast mapping and radiofrequency ablation of focal atrial tachycardia guided by Lasso catheter,"Objectives To assess the value of Lasso catheter(10 poles) in guiding mapping and radiofrequency ablation of focal atrial tachycardia (FAT). Methods Electrophysiological study was performed in 5 patients with FAT,to determine the tachycardia originated either from left or from right atrium. The earliest atrial activations(A waves) were mapped by the radiofrequency catheters under guidance of Lasso poles,and the ablation targets were at the earliest activation sites. Results Fast mapping of all FATs guided by Lasso poles was performed during persistent tachycardia. The earliest A waves,30ï½ž40 ms earlier than p waves,were mapped by radiofrequency ablation catheters in two cases at left atrial appendage,one case respectively at ostia of left superior pulmonary vein,superior vena cava and lateral wall of right atrium. A waves recorded by Lasso catheter were all centrifugal. 5 FATs all were successfully ablated at the earliest activation sites with radiofrequency energy delivery for 1ï½ž3 pulses. No complication occurred. During a period of 2ï½ž20 months follow-up,no FAT recurred. The procedure time and the fluoroscopic time were 40ï½ž60 min and 8ï½ž12 min,respectively. Conclusions These results suggest that Lasso catheter mapping may facilitate fast and accurate identification of ablation sites of FAT and may increase successful rate with less fluoroscopic time and procedure time,especially in some cases such as FATs located in large intracardiac veins or atrial appendage.",2007,South China Journal of Cardiovascular Diseases

A New Estimator By Generalized Modified Jackknife Ridge Regression Estimator,"Multicollinearity is an important problem in regression which produces undesirable effects on the least squares estimator. Ridge regression is one of the well known solutions to the multicollinearity problem.Specifically, the Generalized Ridge Regression (GRR) estimation leads to reduction in the sampling variance whereas Jackknifed Ridge Regression (JRR) estimation leads to reduction in the bias. Batah et al. [1] proposed Modified Jackknife Ridge R egression Estimator (MJR) by combining th e i deas of GRR and JRR estimators. In this article, we propose a new estimator namely, Generalized Jackknife Ridge Regression Estimator (GJR) by generalizing the MJR.
