Blood parameters score predicts long-term outcomes in stage II-III gastric cancer patients,"BACKGROUND
Increasing numbers of laboratory blood parameters (BPM) have been reported to greatly affect the long-term outcomes of gastric cancer (GC) patients. However, the existing prognostic models do not comprehensively analyze these predictors.


AIM
To construct a new prognostic tool, based on all the prognostic BPM, to achieve more accurate prognosis prediction for GC.


METHODS
We retrospectively assessed 850 consecutive patients who underwent curative resection for stage II-III GC from January 2010 to April 2013. The patients were classified into developing (n = 567) and validation (n = 283) cohorts using computer-generated random numbers. A scoring system, namely BPM score, was then constructed using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression model in the developing cohort, and validated in the validation cohort. A nomogram consisting of BPM score and tumor-lymph node-metastasis (TNM) stage was further created. The discrimination and calibration of the nomogram were evaluated via Harrell's C-statistic and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test.


RESULTS
Using the LASSO model, we established the BPM score based on five BPM: Albumin, lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, carcinoembryonic antigen, and carbohydrate antigen 19-9. The BPM scores were divided into high- and low-BPM groups based on a cut-off value of -0.93. High-BPM patients were significantly older and had more advanced, larger tumors. In the developing cohort, significant differences were found in 5-year overall survival (OS) and 5-year disease-specific survival between the high-BPM and low-BPM patients. Similar results were found in the validation group. Multivariable analysis showed that the BPM score was an independent predictor of OS. High-BPM patients had a poorer 5-year OS for each subgroup. Furthermore, a nomogram that combined the BPM score and TNM stage had significantly better prognostic value compared with TNM stage alone.


CONCLUSION
The BPM score provides more accurate prognosis prediction in stage II-III GC patients and is an effective complement to the TNM staging system.",2019,World Journal of Gastroenterology
A Transaction Model for Concurrent,"Abstract Modern programming languages provide features that allow a programmer to express con-currency in an application by using active objects, i.e. objects with their own thread of con-trol, and distribution. Concurrent systems can be classiï¬ed into cooperative systems, whereindividual components collaborate, share results and work for a common goal, and compet-itive systems, where the individual components are not aware of each other and compete forshared resources. Programming languages address collaboration and competition by provid-ing means for communication and synchronization among active objects.The realization of complex object-oriented systems often needs sophisticated andelaborate concurrency features which may go beyond the traditional concurrency controlassociated with separate method calls. A transaction groups together a sequence of actions,and can therefore encapsulate complex behavior and embrace groups of objects and methodcalls. Transactions structure the dynamic system execution as opposed to the static structur-ing based on objects. Because of the ACID properties, transactions are able to hide theeffects of concurrency and at the same time act as ï¬rewalls for errors, making them appro-priate building blocks for structuring reliable distributed systems. This thesis investigateshow transactions can be integrated with concurrent object-oriented programming, and inparticular, how transactions can be made available to an application programmer at the pro-gramming language level.In the ï¬rst part of the thesis, existing transaction models are reviewed and their suit-ability for concurrent programming languages is discussed. The analysis of existing modelsof multithreaded transactions shows that they either give too much freedom to threads anddo not control their participation in transactions, or unnecessarily restrict the computationalmodel by assuming that only one thread can enter a transaction. Hence, a signiï¬cant part ofthis thesis is devoted to the establishment of a new transaction model named",2001,
"Exploring the use of learning techniques for relating the site index of radiata pine stands with climate, soil and physiography","Abstract The environmental uncertainty derived from climate change suggests that some commonly used empirical indicators of forest productivity, such as site index, may not be suitable for future growth prediction in the following decades. As a consequence, the development of statistical models that relate these indicators with environmental variables may be a crucial support resource for practical forest management. In this research, we tested seven different statistical learning techniques for estimating site index of radiata pine (Pinus radiata D. Don) stands in the northwest of Spain. The predictors used for this task were a set of 43 physiographic, soil, and climatic variables obtained from available raster maps for this region, whereas the site index data came from a network of 489 plot-inventory combinations set by the Sustainable Forest Management Unit of the University of Santiago de Compostela. The proposed learning techniques produced models of easy interpretation in comparison to other â€œmachine learningâ€ approaches, and accounted for up to 50% of the responseâ€™s variability. The stepwise, Elastic Net, Least Angle Regression and Infinitesimal Forward Stagewise techniques provided models with high performance but at the expense of including a large number of predictors. By contrast, the Lasso and the Partial Least Squares techniques produced more parsimonious alternatives. However, these models showed noticeable heteroscedastic residuals and a certain regression to the mean. The Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines seemed to be the most suitable technique, as it explained 50% of the site index variability with a reduced amount of predictors, and did not show undesirable patterns in the residuals and predicted values. Besides, the growth-environment relationships represented by this model seemed to be ecologically coherent.",2020,Forest Ecology and Management
Use of Feed Resources in Intensive Urban Ruminant Production Systems: A Case Study from Burkina Faso,"A longitudinal study was conducted in the built-up area of Bobo Dioulasso in Burkina Faso to (i) assess the resource use efficiency in zero-grazing beef cattle production enterprises through quantification of inflows of feeds and outflows of manure; (ii) determine the animalsâ€™ live weight (LW) gains; and (iii) evaluate whether the feeding regime was able to meet the animalsâ€™ energy requirements for maintenance and growth, so as to assess the systemâ€™s overall efficiency. Five representative farms were purposively selected out of a total of 133 surveyed in a previous study. The average number of cattle per farm was 5.4 Â± 1.99, and measurements were carried out in bi-weekly intervals from August 2012 to May 2013. LW of animals averaged 270 Â± 128.8 kg and LW gain ranged from 162 Â± 60 to 423 Â± 200 g dâˆ’1 with an average of 290 Â± 161 g dâˆ’1. The average daily supplies of crude protein and metabolisable energy (MEoffer) of 29 Â± 8.9 g kg-0.75 and 1.5 Â± 0.44 MJ kg-0.75, respectively, clearly exceeded the animalsâ€™ requirements for maintenance plus growth; hence calculated feed conversion ratios were very low. The same was true for the ME use efficiency (4.4 Â± 2.65 g LW gained MJâˆ’1 MEoffer) determined. These results suggest that the feeding management of urban beef cattle keepers in Bobo Dioulasso is resource inefficient, and most likely also improvident. It is advisable that extension services inform urban livestock keepers about the quality of feeds on offer to avoid wastage of feed energy and nutrient resources available to them.",2015,
Convex envelopes of complexity controlling penalties: the case against premature envelopment,"Convex envelopes of the cardinality and rank function, l1 and nuclear norm, have gained immense popularity due to their sparsity inducing properties. This has given rise to a natural approach to building objectives with sparse optima whereby such convex penalties are added to another objective. Such a heuristic approach to objective building does not always work. For example, addition of an L1 penalty to the KL-divergence fails to induce any sparsity, as the L1 norm of any vector in a simplex is a constant. However, a convex envelope of KL and a cardinality penalty can be obtained that indeed trades o sparsity and KL-divergence. We consider the cases of two composite penalties, elastic net and fused lasso, which combine multiple desiderata. In both of these cases, we show that a hard objective relaxed to obtain penalties can be more tightly approximated. Further, by construction, it is impossible to get a better convex approximation than the ones we derive. Thus, constructing a joint envelope across dierent parts of the objective provides a means to trade o tightness and computational cost.",2011,

La passeggiata a mare del Capo Berta e l'impianto talassoterapico del molo ""Landini"": in provincia di Imperia","L'impianto progettuale e localizzato in Liguria,nella provincia di imperia,ed e situato tra Diano Marina e Oneglia;in dettaglio interessa la zona costiera di Capo Berta,comprendente il molo cosiddetto Landini (ovvero Cavour) e la strada a mare che per circa due chilometri si estende da quel molo fino a Oneglia (Imperia). 
 Il progetto consiste nella sistemaizone paesaggistica della strada a mare e nella realizzazione di un centro di talassoterapia con annesso albergo.Il complesso balnere e posto nella zona prospiciente il molo Cavour, elemento costiero che conclude la passeggiata attestandosi su questa parte di Diano Marina. 
 La strada a mare e fiancheggiata da un frangente roccioso fortemente instabile,interessato da problemi di erosione e smottamento,la cui pericolosita si pone come problema fondamentale da risolvere nel progetto. 
 L'intrvento proposto trova la sua motivazione nell'intento di congiungere con un'idea e coerente tutta la passeggiata.Si cerca di caratterizzare questo lungo percorso senza tuttavia distruggere le sensazioni che oggi si colgono,sottolineandole invece attraveros un partioclare atteggiamento imitativo nei confronti dei segni naturali. 
 Il progetto del complesso balneare,sull'area antistante il molo di Cavour,si puo dividere in due blocchi,l'albergo,collocato a ridosso del muro di contenimento che sorregge la strada, e l'impianto di talassoterapia,comprendentemolteplici episodi architettonici articolati su un disegno geometrico rigoroso.Le parti che compongono l'impianto sono:l'edificio d'ingresso,collegato alla parte centrale con le piscine tramite una struttura di distribuzione,il corpo con i locali per i trattamenti,le palestre,nonche due tensostrutture sistemate perificamente.

Formal Region Delineation on the Basis ofAgricultural Productivity and Growth Center,"Agricultural is the largest employment sector of Bangladesh and most of the people earn their living from agricultural production. The magnitude of agricultural production varies spatially as agricultural production depends on topography, the fertility of the land, availability of river, availability of marketing place, input and so on. The intent of our study is to regionalize all the 64 districts of Bangladesh based on Boro production, fish production and the number of growth center and to analyze the impact of it on rural development. To do so, the data are collected from the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS), the composite index method was employed to analyze the data. The data reliability is checked through statistical parameters named level of skewness, kurtosis and standard error of the mean. Then acquired data is classified by using the mean standard deviation method, equal class interval method and the arithmetic mean method. Comparing the three histograms it is found that equal class interval method has more symmetrical shape, hence more normally distributed. Results show that most of the areas are moderately producing the agricultural product. The findings of this study can be used to find out the location which can be best suited for the agricultural industry.

Before the industrial revolution, the purpose of delineation of the region was to find out the homogeneity of phenomena. The formal region is a geographical area which is uniform or homogeneous in terms of selected criteria such as topography, climate, industrial or agricultural-type [4]. Regions are treated as an important source of competition in economic geography [5]. According to J Glasson described â€œA formal region is a geographical area which is uniform or homogeneous in terms of selected criteria such as topography, climate, industrial or agricultural-typeâ€™â€™. Regional development to some extent depends on the impact of the growth center. A center that contributes directly to the basic needs of agricultural producers, both in respect of economic and social services are termed as a growth center [6]. In rural areas, growth tends to concentrate in a center and influence the economy of surrounding areas. Also, growth center plays a significant role to spread growth in surrounding areas [7]. Smith used factor analysis method to identify areas of economic distress [8]. In his study, he divides the North West into several economic health, sub-regions using multiple socio-economic criteria. Flittie also observed the socioeconomic homogeneity using factor analysis method in Rocky Mountain West. The study shows that, physical regions which may or may not follow political boundaries-vary from the Western Hemisphere to the Great Plains to a river basin or watershed or to a national forest. Social and economic regions are equally diversefrom ethnic areas through Nob Hill and city ghetto and from the Common Market through national tariff barriers to regional and local trend centers. (Mohiuddin & Bhuiya, 2013) has conducted a research on formal regionalization of Bangladesh and analyzes the dependencies of one region to another [9]. The intent of the study was to find out lack of the low productive regions. The study has divided the whole country into four regions which will be helpful for taking policy for the agricultural development on the basis of their production level. Crop productivity index and Moran-I statistics have been used in this study. Because of lack of all crops, they use different types of potato, Rice, jute, wheat etc. they consider four classes in data analysis. In this study, they found out that the south-east part of the country is low productive because of hilly terrain and natural disaster-prone area.",2018,
A Model for Teaching Empirically Supported Therapies in a Graduate Course: The Behavior Therapy Seminar Series,"movement that gained traction withthe initial reports on empirically sup-ported psychological procedures bythe American Psychological AssociationDivision 12 Task Force on Promotion andDissemination of Psychological Procedures(1995; Chambless et al., 1998) has continuedto gather momentum, as evidenced by arecent policy statement and presidential taskforce report from the American PsychologicalAssociation on evidence-based practice(2005a, 2005b). While controversial, at leastin some quarters, acknowledgment of the im-portance of integrating evidence-basedpractice seems to be gaining consensus. Although most of the attention has beendirected at the list of empirically supportedtreatments (ESTs) assembled by the TaskForce (Chambless et al., 1998), one of thecomplementary goals of the committee was togain an understanding of the current status oftraining in evidence-based psychological prac-tices among graduate training programs, pre-doctoral internships, and advanced trainingfor practicing professionals. Early studies eval-uating the status of training in ESTs (thencalled â€œempirically validated treatmentsâ€) re-vealed that many programs failed to provideeven introductory coverage for the vast major-ity of evidence-based procedures (Crits-Christoph, Frank, Chambless, Brody, & Karp,1995). The American PsychologicalAssociated added an emphasis on the â€œempiri-cal basis for all methods involved in psycho-logical practiceâ€ to its guidelines for programaccreditation (1996, p. 3). Both Crits-Christoph et al. (1995) and the original TaskForce report (1995) called on APA site visitorsto make training in ESTs a high-prioritycriteria for accreditation decisions. Theoriginal Task Force report also called for in-creased availability of treatment manuals tofacilitate training and dissemination, and asubsequent committee report provided a com-prehensive list of all known available manualsdescribing procedures of treatments on the listof ESTs (Woody & Sanderson, 1998).Calhoun, Moras, Pilkonis, and Rehm (1998)published a â€œcall to armsâ€ encouraging all sci-entist-practitioner training programs to re-double their efforts to integrate training inESTs into their training models. At the pre-doctoral graduate training program level,they encouraged programs to set the stage forfuture learning by providing didactics, super-vised practica, and modeling in the effectiveuse of ESTs. While generally supporting theidea of enhancing graduate training in ESTs,both Davison (1998) and Ingram, Hayes, andScott (2000) offer appropriate cautions thattraining in manualized ESTs may be a neces-sary, but far from sufficient, component ofclinical training programs. Clearly one effectof the EST and evidence-based practice move-ment has been an increased emphasis upontraining and dissemination of empirically sup-ported treatments at all levels, including pre-doctoral graduate training.Unfortunately, there is little evidence thatthese recommendations have been heeded.Although some studies have suggested aslight increase in attention to training in ESTsat the internship level (Hays et al., 2002;Horan & Blanchard, 2001), a recent study ofcurrent graduate student trainees suggeststhat the recommendations and admonitionsfrom the EST movement have had relativelylittle impact upon current predoctoralgraduate training (Karekla, Lundgren, &Forsyth, 2004). An estimated one-third toone-half of students who participated in theirsurvey had little to no exposure to ESTs. One potential hindrance to the wider inte-gration of training in ESTs in graduatetraining programs is a lack of models for doingso. A few examples do exist in the current liter-ature. For example, Roberts (1998) describes atraining program in clinical child psychologythat integrates training in ESTs across the cur-riculum but provides few details on the prag-matics of how that is accomplished.Cukrowicz et al. (2005) briefly described apolicy supporting the use of ESTs in agraduate program training clinic, andprovided evidence for improved client out-comes as a result of the policy, but again in-cluded few details of the pragmatics ofimplementation. Finally, Karekla et al. (2004)included in their discussion a brief example ofhow their graduate program introduces stu-dents to EST and empirically oriented ap-proaches to clinical practice via a course calledâ€œThe Scientist Practitioner,â€ but again detailsare thin. The current article describes one model forproviding graduate students of clinical psy-chology with an introduction to EST and in-troductory training in a number of specificESTs in the context of a graduate course in be-havior therapy. This training model includes anumber of innovative teaching methods, andhas been replicated (in whole or in part) atthree other Big XII peer institutions with sim-ilar graduate training programs.",2006,

Sparse Causality Network Retrieval from Short Time Series,"We investigate how efficiently a known underlying sparse causality structure of a simulated multivariate linear process can be retrieved from the analysis of time series of short lengths. Causality is quantified from conditional transfer entropy and the network is constructed by retaining only the statistically validated contributions. We compare results from three methodologies: two commonly used regularization methods, Glasso and ridge, and a newly introduced technique, LoGo, based on the combination of information filtering network and graphical modelling. For these three methodologies we explore the regions of time series lengths and model-parameters where a significant fraction of true causality links is retrieved. We conclude that when time series are short, with their lengths shorter than the number of variables, sparse models are better suited to uncover true causality links with LoGo retrieving the true causality network more accurately than Glasso and ridge.",2017,Complexity
A Sparse Generative Model and its EM Algorithm for Variable Selection in High-Dimensional Regression,"We address the problem of Bayesian variable selection for high-dimensional linear regression. We consider a generative model that uses a spike-and-slab like prior distribution obtained by multiplying a deterministic binary vector, which traduces the sparsity of the problem, with a random Gaussian parameter vector. Such a model allows an expectation-maximization algorithm, optimizing a type-II log-likelihood, to be derived. This marginal log-likelihood involves an Occam's razor term, automatically penalizing the complexity, which is used for model selection. Albeit NP-hard, the algorithm we propose can be relaxed in order to infer a family of models. Model selection is eventually performed afterwards based on Occam's razor. We report numerical comparisons between our method, called spinyReg, and the most recent variable selection algorithms, including lasso, adaptive lasso and stability selection. SpinyReg turns out to perform well compared to those algorithms, especially regarding false detection rates.",2014,
Sound Field Reproduction in Reverberant Room Using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers Based Lasso and Regularized Least-Square,"This paper presents a three-dimensional (3D) sound-field reproduction (SFR) method based on the Pressure-Matching (PM) approach. The desired sound field is modeled to be reverberation field to approximate a real conference room through the image-source model and the reflection model of the incoherent rough room surfaces. The whole reproduction procedure can be divided into two parts. At the first step, a large number of candidate loudspeaker positions for selecting, and the most efficient active loudspeaker is chosen based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) based Lasso. During the second step, all the selected active loudspeaker weights are calculated via regularized Least-Square (LS) method. Simulation results shows that the proposed SFR approach outperforms the existing PM-based SFR method in most cases for reverberation environment, and the runtime is far less than the reference methods, which means that the proposed approach is especially suited for low-latency sound field synthesis in reverberant rooms.",2019,
MR-radiomic biopsy for estimation of malignancy grade in parotid gland cancer,"We have developed a magnetic resonance (MR) image-based radiomic biopsy approach for estimation of malignancy grade in parotid gland cancer (PGC). Preoperative T1- and T2-weighted MR images of 39 PGC patients with 20 highand 19 intermediate-/low-malignancy grades were employed. High- versus intermediate-/low-malignancy grades were estimated using MR-radiomic biopsy approaches, i.e. 972 hand-crafted feature and transfer learning of five pre-trained deep learning (DL) architectures (AlexNet, GoogLeNet, VGG-16, ResNet-101, DenseNet-201). The 39 patients were divided into 70% for training datasets and 30% for test datasets. The hand-crafted features were extracted from cancer regions in T1- and T2-weighted MR images. Three features were selected as a radiomic signature by using a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), whose coefficients of three features were used for constructing the radiomic score (Rad-score). The two grade malignancy was estimated by using an optimal cut-off value of Rad-score. On the other hand, last three layers of the DL architectures were replaced with new three layers for the estimation task. The DL architectures were fine-tuned with training datasets and were evaluated with test datasets. The performances of the MR-radiomic biopsy approaches were assessed by using the accuracy and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The VGG-16 demonstrated the best performance (accuracy=85.4%, AUC=0.906), but the other approaches showed worse performances (Rad-score: 83.3%, 0.830, AlexNet: 84.4%, 0.915, GoogLeNet: 84.9%, 0.884, ResNet-101: 84.9%, 0.918, DenseNet-201: 84.4%, 0.869) than the VGG-16.

Exploring the Performance of Methods to Deal Multicollinearity: Simulation and Real Data in Radiation Epidemiology Area,"The issue of multicollinearity has long been acknowledged in statistical modelling; however, it is often untreated in the most of published papers. Indeed, the use of methods for multicollinearity correction is still scarce. One important reason is that despite many proposed methods, little is known about their strength or performance. We compare the statistical properties and performance of four main techniques to correct multicollinearity, i.e., Ridge Regression (R-R), Principal Components Regression (PC-R), Partial Least Squares Regression (PLS-R), and Lasso Regression (L-R), in both a simulation study and two real data examples used for modelling volumes of heart and Thyroid as a function of clinical and anthropometric parameters. We find that when the statistical approaches were used to address different levels of collinearity, we observed that R-R, PC-R and PLS-R appeared to have a somewhat similar behavior, with a slight advantage for the PLS-R. Indeed, in all implemented cases, the PLS-R always provided the smallest value of root mean square error (RMSE). When the degree of collinearity was moderate, low or very low, the L-R method had also somewhat similar performance to other methods. Furthermore, correction methods allowed us to provide stable and trustworthy parameter estimates for predictors in the modelling of heart and Thyroid volumes. Therefore, this work will contribute to highlighting performances of methods used only for situations ranging from low to very high multicollinearity.",2018,International journal of statistics in medical research

"Novel and Unexpected Prokaryotic Diversity in Water and Sediments of the Alkaline, Hypersaline Lakes of the Wadi An Natrun, Egypt","The phylogenetic diversity of the bacterial and archaeal community in the water and sediments of three large lakes of the Wadi An Natrun was investigated using 16S rRNA clone libraries. The bacterial community was diverse: 769 clones formed 345 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) defined at 99% 16S rRNA sequence identity. The bacterial community in both the water and sediments of the lakes was dominated by clones affiliated with the low G + C Gram-type-positive group, alpha-proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes, (11-39, 11-30, and 10-37% of OTUs observed, respectively), patterns that have been observed in previously described alkaline, athalassohaline systems. However, a relatively high proportion of Firmicutess-related clones in the water of the lakes and alpha-proteobacteria in the sediments was observed. The bacterial community composition of the water and sediment of the same lake and of different lakes was significantly different (p < 0.05). Operational taxonomic units related to the gamma-proteobacteria were more abundant in the sediment of Lake Fazda, whereas the sediment of Lake UmRisha was dominated by members of the delta-proteobacteria. The proportion of gamma-proteobacterial and Bacteroidetes-affiliated OTUs were predominant in the water of Lake UmRisha and differed significantly from other lake waters (chi-squared analysis, p < or = 0.01). The more oxygenated and dilute nature of Lake Hamra was reflected in its microbial community composition, with the abundance of Bacillales sequences in the water, the absence of Halanaerobiales, Clostridiales, and Archaea in the water, and the presence of representatives of more phyla such as the Actinobacteria, Spirochaetes, and Verrucomicrobia. The archaeal community composition appeared less diverse: 589 clones resulted in 198 OTUs defined at 99% 16S rRNA sequence identity, and all sequences fell into the phylum Euryarchaeota. Phylogenetic analysis showed that many of the sequences were distantly related (83-90% 16S rRNA sequence identity) to cultured and uncultured archaea, with many clones forming clusters that branched deeply within the Euryarchaeota. Forty-two and 53% of the bacterial and archaeal clones had less than 90% 16S rRNA sequence identity to previously described sequences.

Isolation and some properties of an iridovirus-like agent from white sturgeon Acipenser transmontanus,"An iridovirus-like agent (WSIV) associated with fatal infections of the integument of juvenile white sturgeon Acipenser transrnontanus was isolated from fish that exhibited gross and microscopic signs of the disease. The virus induced cell enlargement and slowly progressive degeneration of a recently established cell line from white sturgeon spleen (WSS-2). Virus replication occurred at 10, 15 and 20 OC but not at 5 or 25 OC. The most rapid growth occurred initially at 20 OC but the greatest concentrations (106 TCIDSO ml-') of cell-free virus were detected at 10 and 15 ""C. Numerous virions were observed in the cytoplasn~ of infected WSS-2 cells and ca 70 % of the infectious virus remains cellassociated. Virions possessed an external capsid with an envelope of 260 to 280 nm in diameter that surrounded an inner capsid with a dense nucleoid. Residual viral infectivity (ca 1 %) was found following incubation of the virus at a temperature of 56 ""C for 30 min. The WSIV genome is presumably DNA since 50 pg ml-' 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine completely inhibited viral replication in the WSS-2 line. Virulence for juvenile sturgeon of virus grown in WSS-2 cells was demonstrated by induction of fatal infections (80 % cumulative mortality) following bath exposures to the virus at concentrations of ca 103 TCIDSO g-' fish for 30 min. There were no mortalities among lake sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens, striped bass Morone saxatilis or channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus following bath exposures to the same concentrations of vir.us (TCID50 g-'1 but the agent was recovered from lake sturgeon examined at 1 and 2 wk post-exposure. Microscopic signs of experimentally-induced infections included: presence of large amphophilic to deeply basophilic cells; epithelia1 hyperplasia and degeneration; necrosis in the integument and gill epithelium of white surgeon. Lake sturgeon examined at 1 and 2 wk postinfection demonstrated a similar response, although the cellular hypertrophy was not prom~nent compared to that observed in white sturgeon.",1992,Diseases of Aquatic Organisms
Multi-level modeling and computational approaches to investigate long-term diabetes complications,"Diabetes mellitus is a lifelong, incapacitating disease affecting multiple organs. Worldwide prevalence figures estimate that there are 250 million diabetic patients today and that this number will increase by 50% by 2025. The disease is associated with devastating chronic complications including coronary heart disease, stroke and peripheral vascular disease (macrovascular disease) as well as microvascular disorders, leading to damage of kidneys (nephropathy) and eyes (retinopathy). These complications impose an immense burden on the quality of life of the patients and account for more than 10% of health care costs in Europe. Therefore, novel means to prevent the onset and the progression of these devastating diabetic complications are needed. 
The aim of the work presented in this thesis is to propose novel computational methods to study diabetes complications with a multi-level approach. 
Diabetes mellitus is a strongly multifactorial disease, and several risks factors (such as genetic, and environmental factors) are combined together in a complex trait, leading to the onset of the disease. 
Physiological mechanisms that underlie the disease and the onset and progression of the different complications are still mostly unknown. 
Given the complex nature of diabetes, the study of the complications can be faced with a multi-level modeling approach. In the general scheme for complex disease, such as diabetes, 3 key elements act together to determine the disease status (outcome) of a patient: i) the phenotype, i.e. the set of all metabolic, anthropometric and clinical variables characterizing the patient, ii) the genotype, i.e. the DNA sequence of the patient, iii) the set of interventions on the patient, i.e. therapies and treatments with drugs. All these 3 variables are connected each other through interactions and have a joint effect on the final outcome of the patient. 
The multi-level approach allows to disjoint the full problem into sub-problems, focusing only on a set of variables and interaction (reflecting a specific level of information) according to available data. 
In the present work, 3 main levels of study of diabetes complications are considered, and, for each approach, novel methodologies developed during my PhD are proposed. 
The 3 levels of study considered in the present work are: i) modeling the effect of genotype on the outcome, ii) modeling the effect of phenotype and treatment on the progression of the outcome, iii) modeling the effect of treatment on the phenotype. 
In the first level of study, diabetes complications are studied from a static point of view, i.e. without considering their progression over time, and the main objective is to identify the genetic biomarkers that allow to predict the disease state of the patients with the final goal to stratify patients according to the risk of developing the disease. Genome Wide Associations Studies (GWAs) are statistical studies aiming at identify those SNPs able to explain the differences observed for a certain outcome (the disease status) between cases (diseased subjects) and controls (healthy subjects) in a study population. Several methods performing univariate and/or multivariate selection have been used in literature for the identification of genetic markers from GWAs data. In this thesis, a novel algorithm for genetic biomarker selection and subjects classification from genome-wide SNP data has been developed. The algorithm is based on the Naive Bayes classification framework, enriched by three main features: i) bootstrap aggregating of an ensemble of Naive Bayes classifiers, ii) a novel strategy for ranking and selecting the attributes used by each classifier in the ensemble, iii) a permutation-based procedure for selecting significant biomarkers, based on their marginal utility in the classification process. The algorithm has been validated on the Wellcome Trust Case-Control Consortium on Type 1 Diabetes and its performance compared with the ones of both a standard Naive Bayes algorithm and HyperLASSO, a penalized logistic regression algorithm from the state-of-the-art in simultaneous genome-wide data analysis. 
The second level of study is represented by the dynamic analysis of diabetes complications, where the variable â€œtimeâ€ plays a major role. In particular, the objective is to model the onset and the progression of diabetes complications over time, using phenotypic and therapeutic information, with the final goal to estimate a probability for the diabetic patient to develop a certain complication, thus optimizing clinical trials and avoiding invasive and expensive tests. So far, several models of diabetes complications are present in literature, but none is able to flexibly integrate accumulating â€“omics knowledge (i.e. proteomics, metabolomics, genomics) into a clinical macro-level. The most interesting complication models, in fact, are based on Markov Models (also called state transition model) and use phenotypic information to describe the cohort of interest without the possibility to easily integrate additional information. A new in-silico model for simulating the progression of cardiovascular and kidney complications in diabetic patients is presented. The model proposes, as innovative feature, the use of Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs) for modeling the interactions between variables. Compared to Markov Models, which require as many nodes as the number of combinations of variablesâ€™ values, DBNs are more advantageous in handling both the structure and possible additional information, since each variable is simply represented by a node in the network. The model was built relying on data from the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial, a multicenter randomized clinical trial designed to compare intensive with conventional therapy with regard to their effects on the development and progression of the early vascular and neurologic. The developed model is able to predict the progression of the main diabetes complications with an accuracy greater than 95% at a population level. The model is suitable to be used as a decision support tool to help clinicians in the therapy design through cost-effectiveness analysis: exploiting the simulations generated through the model, it is possible, for example, to choose the best strategy between two different therapies for treating a specific cohort of patients. To this aim, a user-interface based on the present model is currently under development. The flexible structure of the model will allow to easily add genotypic information in the next feature as a potential mean to improve predictions. 
The last level of study focuses on the action of a specific drug on a target phenotype, with the final aim to develop rational means to personalize drug therapy and to ensure maximum efficacy with minimal adverse effects. Focusing on cardiovascular diseases as a direct complication of diabetes, aspirin therapy is an important component of cardiovascular prevention for high risk patients. Aspirin performs its preventive action by inhibiting a key enzyme (the prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase PTGS-1, also known as cyclooxygenase COX-1) in the cascade leading to the production of thromboxane B2 (TxB2), the major factor involved in the platelets aggregation with consequent formation of thrombi. It is known, from literature, that diabetic patients exhibit a different response to aspirin therapy in comparison to healthy subjects, showing a reduced effectiveness of the drug, which is often referred to as â€˜aspirin resistanceâ€™. Given the lack of a mathematical characterization of these phenomena, the problem was faced using a pharmacodynamics modeling approach, with an explorative intent. Relaying on biological knowledge retrieved from literature, a partially lumped and partially distributed compartmental model was developed, able to describe: i) the kinetics of COX-1 enzyme, from its production within megakaryocytes in bone-marrow to circulating platelets in blood, ii) the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of aspirin, i.e. its distribution in the body tissues and its interaction with COX-1. The model was tested using data of serum thromboxane TxB2 recovery levels after aspirin withdrawal in healthy subjects. Possible mechanisms to explain the so-called â€˜aspirin resistanceâ€™ have been finally discussed.",2014,
"How many species of the aquatic sloth Thalassocnus (Xenarthra: Megatheriidae) were in Chile?: new evidences from the BahiÌa Inglesa Formation, with a reappraisal of their biochronological affinities","The aquatic sloth, Thalassocnus, is one of the most intriguing lineage of mammal known from the southern pacific coast of South America during the late Neogene. It was initially recognized in PerÃº, but recent paleontological surveys also recorded its presence in Chile. However, the determination of how many species of Thalassocnus were actually present in Chile remains as an open question. Here, we provide a detailed morphological description of an isolated distal fragment of humerus recovered at the Mina Fosforita member (ca. 7 Ma), BahÃ­a Inglesa Formation (Atacama Region, northern Chile), which is referred to Thalassocnus. Morphological comparisons with others forms from Chile and PerÃº allow us to attribute the CPUC/C/557 specimen to Thalassocnus cf. T. natans, though some degree of intraspecific variation is acknowledged. The assessment of the stratigraphic provenance of the materials with previously assigned to Thalassocnus from the BahÃ­a Inglesa, HorcÃ³n and Coquimbo formations, permits us to propose that the taxonomic diversity of Thalassocnus in Chile is unequivocal conformed by T. carolomartini, and T. natans. We also admitted the likely presence of T. antiquus and probably T. yaucensis. Futures discoveries of more complete specimens, and/or the detailed analysis of undescribed specimens from Chile will undoubtedly contribute to illustrate the evolutionary history of the Thalassocnus radiation in Chile.",2019,
"Probabilistic cost, risk, and throughput analysis of lunar transportation architectures","The President's vision for space exploration presents a need to determine the best architecture and set of vehicle elements in order to achieve a sustained human lunar exploration program. The Lunar Architecture Stochastic Simulator and Optimizer (LASSO), a new simulation-based capability based on discrete-event simulation, was created to address this question by probabilistically simulating lunar transportation architecture based on cost, reliability, and throughput figures of merit. In this study, two competing lunar transportation architectures are examined for a variety of launch vehicle scenarios to determine the best approach for human lunar exploration. Additionally, the two architectures are also compared for varying available ground infrastructure and desired flight rates. It is concluded that an expendable architecture is favored, using man-rated versions of existing evolved expendable launch vehicles (EELVs) for crew launches and developing a heavy-lift launch vehicle for cargo launches",2006,2006 IEEE Aerospace Conference
Enhancer identification in mouse embryonic stem cells using integrative modeling of chromatin and genomic features,"BackgroundEpigenetic modifications, transcription factor (TF) availability and differences in chromatin folding influence how the genome is interpreted by the transcriptional machinery responsible for gene expression. Enhancers buried in non-coding regions are found to be associated with significant differences in histone marks between different cell types. In contrast, gene promoters show more uniform modifications across cell types. Here we used histone modification and chromatin-associated protein ChIP-Seq data sets in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells as well as genomic features to identify functional enhancer regions. Using co-bound sites of OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG (co-OSN, validated enhancers) and co-bound sites of MYC and MYCN (limited enhancer activity) as enhancer positive and negative training sets, we performed multinomial logistic regression with LASSO regularization to identify key features.ResultsCross validations reveal that a combination of p300, H3K4me1, MED12 and NIPBL features to be top signatures of co-OSN regions. Using a model from 10 signatures, 83% of top 1277 putative 1â€‰kb enhancer regions (probability greater than or equal to 0.8) overlapped with at least one TF peak from 7 mouse ES cell ChIP-Seq data sets. These putative enhancers are associated with increased gene expression of neighbouring genes and significantly enriched in multiple TF bound loci in agreement with combinatorial models of TF binding. Furthermore, we identified several motifs of known TFs significantly enriched in putative enhancer regions compared to random promoter regions and background. Comparison with an active H3K27ac mark in various cell types confirmed cell type-specificity of these enhancers.ConclusionsThe top enhancer signatures we identified (p300, H3K4me1, MED12 and NIPBL) will allow for the identification of cell type-specific enhancer regions in diverse cell types.",2011,BMC Genomics

Identification of a historical morphogenic earthquake through trenching at ancient Sagalassos (SW Turkey),"Abstract The Sagalassos Fault is one of the candidate faults for the devastating earthquakes that struck the ancient Pisidian town of Sagalassos, situated some 10Â km SSW of Isparta (SW Turkey), early in the 6th century a.d . and in the middle or during the second half of the 7th century a.d . The Sagalassos Fault is an at least 150-m wide and âˆ¼10Â km long active normal fault zone, passing through and behind the ancient town. The southern base of the limestone cliff at the northwestern extremity of Sagalassos is believed to represent the strongly degraded master fault. The Sagalassos Fault Necropolis -trench, exposing this limestone face and its hanging wall deposits, reveals a fresh normal fault slip plane. Fault breccia, dip-slip frictional-wear striae, tool tracks, spall marks, dilational fractures and a flowstone are present on the excavated limestone face. Moreover, in the excavated part of the hanging wall, evidence of historical reactivation of the main fault has been inferred within anthropogenic deposits. The main argument is a 20-cm thick shear zone against the limestone face. This shear zone affects a man-made dump of the Early Imperial Period (ca. 25Â  b.c .â€“100Â  a.d .). The shear zone has an indurated and compact aspect, a parallel alignment of ceramic and limestone fragments, dip-slip striae and a vertical displacement of layers within the dump. The new findings of this study suggest that the surface-rupturing event identified may very well correspond to the 6th or 7th century earthquake, thus identifying a to date unknown seismically active and potentially hazardous fault in the Burdurâ€“Isparta area.",2005,Journal of Geodynamics
Feature Selection and Combination of Information in the Functional Brain Connectome for Discrimination of Mild Cognitive Impairment and Analyses of Altered Brain Patterns,"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is often considered a critical time window for predicting early conversion to Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD). Brain functional connectome data (i.e., functional connections, global and nodal graph metrics) based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) provides numerous information about brain networks and has been used to discriminate normal controls (NCs) from subjects with MCI. In this paper, Studentâ€™s t-tests and group-least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (group-LASSO) were used to extract functional connections with significant differences and the most discriminative network nodes, respectively. Based on group-LASSO, the middle temporal, inferior temporal, lingual, posterior cingulate, and middle frontal gyri were the most predominant brain regions for nodal observation in MCI patients. Nodal graph metrics (within-module degree, participation coefficient, and degree centrality) showed the maximum discriminative ability. To effectively combine the multipattern information, we employed the multiple kernel learning support vector machine (MKL-SVM). Combined with functional connectome information, the MKL-SVM achieved a good classification performance (area under the receiving operating characteristic curve = 0.9728). Additionally, the altered brain connectome pattern revealed that functional connectivity was generally decreased in the whole-brain network, whereas graph theory topological attributes of some special nodes in the brain network were increased in MCI patients. Our findings demonstrate that optimal feature selection and combination of all connectome features (i.e., functional connections, global and nodal graph metrics) can achieve good performance in discriminating NCs from MCI subjects. Thus, the combination of functional connections and global and nodal graph metrics of brain networks can predict the occurrence of MCI and contribute to the early clinical diagnosis of AD.",2020,Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience
Identifying predictive features in drug response using machine learning: opportunities and challenges.,"This article reviews several techniques from machine learning that can be used to study the problem of identifying a small number of features, from among tens of thousands of measured features, that can accurately predict a drug response. Prediction problems are divided into two categories: sparse classification and sparse regression. In classification, the clinical parameter to be predicted is binary, whereas in regression, the parameter is a real number. Well-known methods for both classes of problems are briefly discussed. These include the SVM (support vector machine) for classification and various algorithms such as ridge regression, LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator), and EN (elastic net) for regression. In addition, several well-established methods that do not directly fall into machine learning theory are also reviewed, including neural networks, PAM (pattern analysis for microarrays), SAM (significance analysis for microarrays), GSEA (gene set enrichment analysis), and k-means clustering. Several references indicative of the application of these methods to cancer biology are discussed.",2015,Annual review of pharmacology and toxicology

Application of linear mixed-effects model with LASSO to identify metal components associated with cardiac autonomic responses among welders: a repeated measures study,"BACKGROUND
Environmental and occupational exposure to metals is ubiquitous worldwide, and understanding the hazardous metal components in this complex mixture is essential for environmental and occupational regulations.


OBJECTIVE
To identify hazardous components from metal mixtures that are associated with alterations in cardiac autonomic responses.


METHODS
Urinary concentrations of 16 types of metals were examined and 'acceleration capacity' (AC) and 'deceleration capacity' (DC), indicators of cardiac autonomic effects, were quantified from ECG recordings among 54 welders. We fitted linear mixed-effects models with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) to identify metal components that are associated with AC and DC. The Bayesian Information Criterion was used as the criterion for model selection procedures.


RESULTS
Mercury and chromium were selected for DC analysis, whereas mercury, chromium and manganese were selected for AC analysis through the LASSO approach. When we fitted the linear mixed-effects models with 'selected' metal components only, the effect of mercury remained significant. Every 1â€‰Âµg/L increase in urinary mercury was associated with -0.58 ms (-1.03, -0.13) changes in DC and 0.67 ms (0.25, 1.10) changes in AC.


CONCLUSION
Our study suggests that exposure to several metals is associated with impaired cardiac autonomic functions. Our findings should be replicated in future studies with larger sample sizes.",2017,Occupational and Environmental Medicine
Different Role of Left Atrial Size and Function in Patients with Paroxysmal versus Persistent Atrial Fibrillation,"Purpose: Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) is established as interventional treatment in atrial fibrillation (AF). Recent studies suggest that atrial reservoir function (preload) is involved in initiation of paroxysmal AF (AFparox) and conduit function (after-load) may be crucial in persistent AF (AFpers). Methods: We enrolled 336 consecutive patients scheduled for PVI (age 60Â±10 years). Point-to-point radiofrequency ablation was used in the majority of cases. Success was defined as a minimum of 3 months (median 12 months) follow-up as absence of recurrence of AF in any Holter ECG since PVI. Results: Patients with recurrent AFparox demonstrated a significantly better outcome (64% success) than patients with AFpers (41% success). AFparox patients were 5 years younger and had smaller atria, a better emptying index, higher systolic pulmonary venous velocity, and only borderline impaired diastolic left ventricular function. LA size per se was not related to success in AFparox. Left ventricular filling times (Tfill) and the ratio of systolic to diastolic tissue Doppler (TDI) velocity (Sâ€™/Eâ€™) were found to be potential risk predictors. Increased LA-size, reduced LA-emptying and impaired diastolic left ventricular function were found in AFpers patients. Sâ€™/Eâ€™ and isovolumic relaxation time stratify risk in AFpers patients. Conclusions: In AFparox long term failure of primary PVI is associated with restrictive reservoir function but not LA enlargement. Whereas in AFpers a combination of severely reduced LA emptying, increased LA size and severely impaired diastolic LV function result in a high rate of recurrent AF. TDI (Tfill, Sâ€™/Eâ€™) may help to improve risk stratification. in particular pulmonary vein isolation (PVI), can be considered as an early option in the management of patients with AF [5]. Success rates of the initial ablation procedure depend on the definition of success; they vary between 60 and 85% for AFparox and are lower for persistent AF (AFpers) [3,6-9]. The initiation of AF requires both a trigger and a susceptible substrate. In recurrent AFparox ectopic focal activity is thought to be local and limited to one or a few sites. On the contrary in AFpers there tend to be multiple ectopic sites throughout the atria and advanced damage of atrial myocardium (more susceptible substrate) [10-13]. Large left atrial (LA) size was found to be a predictor of recurrence of AF after electrical or pharmacological cardio-version as well as after ablative treatment [14-17]. The prognostic value of volume seems to be absent in AFparox, however [18]. LA function comprises three phases: reservoir, conduit and active contraction phase [19]. LAactive function increases with slight volume load as long as LA structural dilatation is limited [19,20]. Thus, in early LA dysfunction as expected in AFparox systolic LA dimensions are ambiguous, because an increased systolic volume may reflect increased loading and/or size (history of dilatation). Recent studies suggest that preserved atrial reservoir function related to preload is a predictor of success [21]. Impairment of atrial reservoir function and poor long-term success of PVI in small left atria was related to enhanced fibrosis [22]. Whereas conduit function related to after-load may become increasingly important for PVI success in large atria with poor emptying. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that in AFparox atrial reservoir function and in AFpers residual conduit function is crucial for success of PVI by an analysis in the function-size plane in a retrospective study in our PVI data-base. As second end points we wanted to identify echocardiographic parameters potentially predicting recurrence of AF after PVI and elucidate the impact of body mass index (BMI) in this context.

AF is responsible for an increased risk of stroke, heart failure and all-cause mortality [1]. Haissaguerre et al. demonstrated that ectopic activity in pulmonary veins (PV) may be responsible for triggering AF, particularly in paroxysmal AF (AFparox) [2]. Thus, ablation of tissue where ectopic activity arises is an interventional treatment strategy.

J Cardiobiol 1(2): 10 (2013) Page 02 observational prospective cohort of consecutive patients scheduled for PVI to treat AF. Inclusion criteria were symptomatic, medically refractory AF eligible for ablative treatment and feasibility of a TTE study. Patients with LAdiameter >60 mm, valve prosthesis, pacemaker or LV-EF<40% were excluded. The study complies with the declaration of Helsinki. The research protocol was approved by the internal review board and all patients gave written informed consent. Study protocol One day prior to the intervention a transthoracic (TTE) and a transoesophageal (TEE) echocardiogram were obtained with an IE33 Philips machine. All patients underwent a comprehensive evaluation with M-mode, B-mode, pulsed Doppler and tissue Doppler imaging. Each measurement was repeated at least seven times in AF and at least thrice if SR was present. Peak early filling velocity (E) and deceleration time (EDT) were determined in pulsed Doppler measurements with a sample volume at the tips of the mitral leaflet. For determination of isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT) the sample volume was adjusted between inflow and outflow jet and time resolution was maximized. LA diameter (LA), area (LAA) and volume (LAV) were evaluated at end systole (maximum) and at end diastole (minimum). LA volumes were calculated from apical LAA by a modified biplane area length method [23]. Emptying index was calculated as 1 LAVdiast/ LAVsys. 4D volumes were additionally acquired by 4D echocardiography (Philips IE33) before PVI since end of 2010. An example is displayed in Figure 1. Pulmonary vein systolic (PVsyst) and diastolic (PVdiast) peak velocities were derived from pulsed Doppler measurements, and a non-dimensional ratio (S/D ratio) was calculated. Systolic (Sâ€™) and early diastolic (Eâ€™) tissue Doppler (TDI) of left ventricular base/ mitral ring velocities were measured in a four chamber (septal and lateral) and two chamber view (anterior, inferior). Median Sâ€™, were calculated. TDI data were analyzed offline with QLabTM (PHILIPS B.V Eindhoven The Netherlands). In view of the limitations of LA size and emptying index in predicting PVI success in AFparox we evaluated a high resolution monitoring of the time course left ventricular contraction and filling by measurement of time intervals between R-wave and maximal negative strain and between maximal negative strain and return to 70% of the start value (Tfill). User interaction is minimized (selection of ROI in QLABTM and visual quality check) to warrant standardized and reproducible assessment of these times. Exported spread sheets are automatically post processed by a simple generic algorithm. Definition of success Follow-up included repeated 24-hour Holter ECG at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 18 months after PVI. Anti-arrhythmic drugs were withdrawn 4 weeks and 3 months after ablative treatment of AFparox and AFpers respectively. Success was defined and assessed independently in patients with a minimum of 3 months follow-up as absence of recurrence of AF in any Holter ECG since PVI. Ablation procedure Oral anticoagulation was stopped 3-7 days before the scheduled ablation. Point-to-point radiofrequency ablation was used in the majority of cases in the study sample. Three dimensional anatomy of left atrial pulmonary vein ostia was reconstructed from rotational angiography [24,25]. The end-point of the procedure was the electrical isolation of all pulmonary veins defined as elimination of PV potentials at the Lasso catheter that was positioned as closely as possible to the PV ostium.

Means Â± standard deviations and rates (percentages) and p-values for significant group differences (t-test, Mann Whitney U test) are given. The subset of 4D volumes additionally acquired by 4D echocardiography serves as cross-validation sample. As general validation strategy bootstrapping (100 samples) was performed in larger groups. Correlation and regression analysis and scatter and box plots were employed for pattern analysis regarding group differences.

Abstract 5101: Defining exposure-PD and efficacy relationships with the novel liver-targeting nucleotide prodrug MIV-818 for the treatment of liver cancers,"Background: Many systemic chemotherapeutics have failed to show efficacy in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), often because systemic toxicity prevents efficacious liver levels of the drug from being reached. MIV-818, a nucleotide prodrug of troxacitabine-monophosphate (TRX-MP) has been designed as a novel approach to deliver high levels of the chain-terminating nucleotide troxacitabine-triphosphate (TRX-TP) to the liver after oral dosing while minimizing systemic exposure. We investigated MIV-818 and troxacitabine using in vivo models in order to identify therapeutic levels of TRX-TP required in the tumors. Methods: MIV-818 or troxacitabine were administered to nude mice with subcutaneous Hep3B or Huh7 xenografts. LC-MS/MS was used to assess MIV-818 and its metabolites. Effects on tumor growth, plasma AFP, inhibition of proliferation and induction of DNA damage were examined and correlated with exposures to TRX-TP in the tumor. Quantitative immuno-fluorescent histology was used to assess DNA damage (pH2AX) proliferation (BrdU), and hypoxia (pimonidazole). Results: Compared to the parent nucleoside troxacitabine, MIV-818 has increased potency of inhibition of HCC cell line growth, increased conversion to its active metabolite TRX-TP and in vitro properties optimized for oral bioavailability and liver targeting, including permeability and intestinal stability. MIV-818 also shows strong synergistic anti-proliferative activity with sorafenib in a number of HCC cell lines in vitro. Pronounced tumor growth inhibition of 70-100% and extensive tumor growth delays of up to 26 days were observed in the Hep3B xenograft model following a five day period of dosing. 12-32-fold induction of DNA damage was seen throughout the tumor sections, consistent with the expected mechanism of action, and with associated inhibition of proliferation. Clear PD responses were apparent even in hypoxic regions of the tumor, indicating effective distribution of TRX-TP even far from blood vessels. DNA damage persisted for up to 7 days after the final dose, demonstrating long-lasting effects and indicating that intermittent dosing is likely to be effective. Similar dosing regimens given to Huh7 xenograft models resulted in significant tumor growth inhibition and induction of DNA damage. Intratumoral TRX-TP exposures across both models were correlated with anti-tumor effects including DNA damage induction, proliferation inhibition and tumor growth inhibition. Conclusions: We have identified TRX-TP exposures required for pronounced anti-tumor effects to give a comprehensive understanding of PK-PD-efficacy relationships for the active metabolite of MIV-818.

Entwicklung und Etablierung von Testsystemen zur Evaluierung der Lektin-Zell-Interaktionen gedehnter und ungedehnter Urothelzellen,"Zur Optimierung des Instillationsvolumens bei der intravesikalen Therapie von Harnblasenkarzinomen wurde im Rahmen dieser Diplomarbeit ein Analysenprotokoll zur genau regulierbaren Dehnung von Urothelzellen entwickelt, um so die Internalisation fluoreszenzmarkierter Lektine unter Anwendung von Dehnung mit der Internalisation in Ruhe vergleichen zu konnen. Nach Entwicklung eines geeingneten Dichtungssystem zur Verwendung des Flexcell FX5000-Tension Systems wurden Internalisationsstudien an der Urothelkarzinomzelllinie 5637 bei 37 Â°C durchgefuhrt, die belegen, dass bei einer Dehnungsdauer von 30 Minuten und bei einer Elongation von 4 % die RFI von abWGA und fLCA um 10 %, von fPNA sogar um 20 % gesteigert werden konnte. Da die Dehnung mittels FX-5000 nur im Inkubator bei 37 Â°C durchgefuhrt werden kann, wurde weiters eine Methode entwickelt, die einen direkten Vergleich der RFI nach Dehnung bei 4 Â°C und bei 37 Â°C erlaubt. Dafur wurden die Zellen entweder im Wasserbad bei 37 Â°C oder im Kuhlschrank bei 4 Â°C mithilfe kugelformiger Dehnungskorper (O=1 cm) gedehnt. Dabei konnte gezeigt werden, dass die erhohte RFI nach Dehnung nicht nur auf eine erhohte Zellassoziation an die vergroserte Oberflache zuruckzufuhren ist, sondern auch vermehrt Internalisation stattfindet. Zusammenfassend lasst sich also festhalten, dass durch Erhohung des Instillationsvolumens in Kombination mit der Kopplung der Wirkstoffe an Lektine eine Therapieverbesserung des Harnblasenkarzinoms erwirkt werden konnte. Um das optimale Volumen zu finden, bedarf es jedoch weiterer Untersuchungen. Die im Rahmen dieser Diplomarbeit entwickelte Methode zur Dehnung der Urothelzellen bietet fur diese die optimale Basis. Auch eine eventuelle rasche Reversibilitat der Internalisation wurde durch Kontrolle der Fluoreszenzsignale der Zellen sowie des Uberstands nach Beendigung eines Dehnungszyklus aber auch wahrend eines weiteren Dehnungszyklus evaluiert. Dabei wurde keine vermehrte Exozytose festgestellt, die RFI der gedehnten Zellen blieb durchwegs um denselben prozentuellen Wert erhoht. 
Um einen Einblick in die moglichen Mechanismen der Endo- sowie der Exozytose zu gewinnen, wurden verschiedene Inhibitoren dieser evaluiert. Dabei zeigte sich, dass bei 5637-Zellen Methyl-s-Cyclodextrin und eventuell Dynasore einen Einfluss auf die Internalisation von WGA und LCA haben konnte. Diese Erkenntnisse deuten auf eine Beteiligung von Caveolin-abhangigen Endozytoseprozessen (Methyl-s-Cyclodextrin) sowie von Dynamin (Dynasore) hin. 
Bei der Inhibition der Exozytose aus 5637-Zellen scheint Brefeldin A wirksam zu sein, bei SV-HUC-1-Zellen hingegen vor allem Dynasore. Ob dies durch einen unterschiedlichen Exozytosemechanismus bedingt ist, bedarf jedoch ebenfalls weiterer Evaluierung.",2015,
Sparsity Regularization for classification of large dimensional data,"Feature selection has evolved to be a very important step in several machine learning paradigms. Especially in the domains of bio-informatics and text classification which involve data of high dimensions, feature selection can help in drastically reducing the feature space. In cases where it is difficult or infeasible to obtain sufficient training examples, feature selection helps overcome the curse of dimensionality which in turn helps improve performance of the classification algorithm. The focus of our research are five embedded feature selection methods which use the ridge regression, or use Lasso regression, and those which combine the two with the goal of simultaneously performing variable selection and grouping correlated variables.",2017,ArXiv
"Diagnostic, progressive and prognostic performance of m6A methylation RNA regulators in lung adenocarcinoma","Background: N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA methylation is dynamically and reversibly regulated by methyl-transferases (""writers""), binding proteins (""readers""), and demethylases (""erasers""). The m6A is restored to adenosine and thus to achieve demethylation modification. The abnormality of m6A epigenetic modification in cancer has been increasingly attended. However, we are rarely aware of its diagnostic, progressive and prognostic performance in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Methods and Results: The expression of 13 widely reported m6A RNA regulators in LUAD and normal samples were systematically analyzed. There were 12 m6A RNA methylation genes displaying aberrant expressions, and an 11-gene diagnostic score model was finally built (Diagnostic score =0.033*KIAA1429+0.116*HNRNPC+0.115*RBM15-0.067* METTL3-0.048*ZC3H13-0.221*WTAP+ 0.213*YTHDF1-0.132*YTHDC1-0.135* FTO+0.078*YTHDF2+0.014*ALKBH5). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to demonstrate superiority of the diagnostic score model (Area under the curve (AUC) was 0.996 of training cohort, P<0.0001; AUC was 0.971 of one validation cohort-GSE75037, P<0.0001; AUC was 0.878 of another validation cohort-GSE63459, P<0.0001). In both training and validation cohorts, YTHDC2 was associated with tumor stage (P<0.01), while HNRNPC was up expressed in progressed tumor (P<0.05). Besides, WTAP, RBM15, KIAA1429, YTHDF1, and YTHDF2 were all up expressed for TP53 mutation. Furthermore, using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) regression analysis, a ten-gene risk score model was built. Risk score=0.169*ALKBH5-0.159*FTO+0.581*HNRNPC-0.348* YTHDF2-0.265*YTHDF1-0.123*YTHDC2 +0.434*RBM15+0.143*KIAA1429-0.200*WTAP-0.310*METTL3. There existed correlation between the risk score and TNM stage (P<0.01), lymph node stage (P<0.05), gender (P<0.05), living status (P<0.001). Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses of relevant clinicopathological characters and the risk score revealed risk score was an independent risk factor of lung adenocarcinoma (HR: 2.181, 95%CI (1.594-2.984), P<0.001). Finally, a nomogram was built to facilitate clinicians to predict outcome. Conclusions: m6A epigenetic modification took part in the progression, and provided auxiliary diagnosis and prognosis of LUAD.",2020,International Journal of Biological Sciences

A Significance Test for the Lasso.,"In the sparse linear regression setting, we consider testing the significance of the predictor variable that enters the current lasso model, in the sequence of models visited along the lasso solution path. We propose a simple test statistic based on lasso fitted values, called the covariance test statistic, and show that when the true model is linear, this statistic has an Exp(1) asymptotic distribution under the null hypothesis (the null being that all truly active variables are contained in the current lasso model). Our proof of this result for the special case of the first predictor to enter the model (i.e., testing for a single significant predictor variable against the global null) requires only weak assumptions on the predictor matrix X. On the other hand, our proof for a general step in the lasso path places further technical assumptions on X and the generative model, but still allows for the important high-dimensional case p > n, and does not necessarily require that the current lasso model achieves perfect recovery of the truly active variables. Of course, for testing the significance of an additional variable between two nested linear models, one typically uses the chi-squared test, comparing the drop in residual sum of squares (RSS) to a [Formula: see text] distribution. But when this additional variable is not fixed, and has been chosen adaptively or greedily, this test is no longer appropriate: adaptivity makes the drop in RSS stochastically much larger than [Formula: see text] under the null hypothesis. Our analysis explicitly accounts for adaptivity, as it must, since the lasso builds an adaptive sequence of linear models as the tuning parameter Î» decreases. In this analysis, shrinkage plays a key role: though additional variables are chosen adaptively, the coefficients of lasso active variables are shrunken due to the [Formula: see text] penalty. Therefore, the test statistic (which is based on lasso fitted values) is in a sense balanced by these two opposing properties-adaptivity and shrinkage-and its null distribution is tractable and asymptotically Exp(1).",2014,Annals of statistics
Can Automatic Classification Help to Increase Accuracy in Data Collection?,"Abstract Purpose The authors aim at testing the performance of a set of machine learning algorithms that could improve the process of data cleaning when building datasets. Design/methodology/approach The paper is centered on cleaning datasets gathered from publishers and online resources by the use of specific keywords. In this case, we analyzed data from the Web of Science. The accuracy of various forms of automatic classification was tested here in comparison with manual coding in order to determine their usefulness for data collection and cleaning. We assessed the performance of seven supervised classification algorithms (Support Vector Machine (SVM), Scaled Linear Discriminant Analysis, Lasso and elastic-net regularized generalized linear models, Maximum Entropy, Regression Tree, Boosting, and Random Forest) and analyzed two properties: accuracy and recall. We assessed not only each algorithm individually, but also their combinations through a voting scheme. We also tested the performance of these algorithms with different sizes of training data. When assessing the performance of different combinations, we used an indicator of coverage to account for the agreement and disagreement on classification between algorithms. Findings We found that the performance of the algorithms used vary with the size of the sample for training. However, for the classification exercise in this paper the best performing algorithms were SVM and Boosting. The combination of these two algorithms achieved a high agreement on coverage and was highly accurate. This combination performs well with a small training dataset (10%), which may reduce the manual work needed for classification tasks. Research limitations The dataset gathered has significantly more records related to the topic of interest compared to unrelated topics. This may affect the performance of some algorithms, especially in their identification of unrelated papers. Practical implications Although the classification achieved by this means is not completely accurate, the amount of manual coding needed can be greatly reduced by using classification algorithms. This can be of great help when the dataset is big. With the help of accuracy, recall, and coverage measures, it is possible to have an estimation of the error involved in this classification, which could open the possibility of incorporating the use of these algorithms in software specifically designed for data cleaning and classification. Originality/value We analyzed the performance of seven algorithms and whether combinations of these algorithms improve accuracy in data collection. Use of these algorithms could reduce time needed for manual data cleaning.",2016,Journal of Data and Information Science
Learning (from) Deep Hierarchical Structure among Features,"Data features usually can be organized in a hierarchical structure to reflect the relations among them. Most of previous studies that utilize the hierarchical structure to help improve the performance of supervised learning tasks can only handle the structure of a limited height such as 2. In this paper, we propose a Deep Hierarchical Structure (DHS) method to handle the hierarchical structure of an arbitrary height with a convex objective function. The DHS method relies on the exponents of the edge weights in the hierarchical structure but the exponents need to be given by users or set to be identical by default, which may be suboptimal. Based on the DHS method, we propose a variant to learn the exponents from data. Moreover, we consider a case where even the hierarchical structure is not available. Based on the DHS method, we propose a Learning Deep Hierarchical Structure (LDHS) method which can learn the hierarchical structure via a generalized fused-Lasso regularizer and a proposed sequential constraint. All the optimization problems are solved by proximal methods where each subproblem has an efficient solution. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.",2019,
The Spirit of Competition: Wak in Burkina Faso,"ABSTRACT This article examines the occult powers used to obtain protection or to gain an advantage in modern competitive arenas. In Burkina Faso, these powers are widely known as wak. The discussion focuses on sporting events, an area largely neglected in the recent literature on sorcery and modernity. Unlike what is often assumed or claimed about beliefs in occult powers, it is suggested that wak acts a complement and not as the condition of an individual's talent or success. ********** A few years ago a Burkinabe newspaper published an interview with Joseph Zongo, one of the country's greatest cycle racing champions. Half way through the conversation the journalist asked, `Do you believe in wak?' `No, I don't believe in it. At one point in my career I fell victim to a series of problems. I kept coming off. I was constantly getting punctures. People told me to see this person or that person who might be able to help. But I never did. All I did was work harder and take care of my bicycle' (Le Pays, 29 April 1992). To the uninitiated, wak might appear to be a new technique or a new approach to cycle racing. Yet most Burkinabe people would readily tell you that wak consists in the manipulation of ritual objects by experts in esoteric knowledge. (1) A year later the same newspaper ran a retrospective on African sport which included a description of incidents in a soccer match opposing the Elephants of Cote d'Ivoire to the Tigers of the Central African Republic in the 1973 African Nations Cup (ibid., 30 April 1993). After getting off the aeroplane, the Tigers refused the accommodation offered by their hosts and chose to walk to the houses of compatriots residing in Abidjan. According to the article, a few minutes before starting time `the Central Africans engaged in a few fetishistic demonstrations which excited the crowd.' At half time the Tigers refused to return to their locker room and remained instead on the field from fear that their hosts would engage in mystical doings in their absence. A Tiger player got involved in an incident with a ballboy, which ended up in a general brawl involving the police and the crowd. When the disruption eventually subsided the Tigers had left the field for good. In his description of these incidents the journalist reported the `fetishist practices' as an integral part of the competition, if not without some critical distance. Many Burkinabe `intellectuals' publicly deride the popularity of occult powers in African sport as a relic of rejected traditions in modern African society. Unaffected by criticism, a great number of practitioners of wak like to present themselves as defenders of African traditions yet not opposed to l'evolution, a term widely used to mean `socio-economic change'. Recourse to occult powers is widespread in Burkina Faso, as in many other African countries, particularly in national competitive arenas such as sport and school, and in the more exclusive political sphere. People from all walks of life--villagers, poor urban dwellers, the financial and political elite--and of different religious backgrounds have recourse to experts in esoteric knowledge, making some of them rich and famous. What, for lack of a better term, scholars call occult powers are known as maraboutage in French-speaking Africa. Specialists of the occult are called indifferently marabouts (2) or sorcerers but also wak-man in Burkina Faso, and the objects they manufacture are variously known as amulets, gris-gris, charms or seben (`writing' in Jula, the trade language of this part of West Africa) that consist of verses of the Koran sealed in leather pouches. The indiscriminate and widespread use of these terms is revealing of the integration of local and Muslim religious traditions in everyday life. This ethnography is situated in both urban and rural settings in Burkina Faso. It is based on the observation of football matches and political campaigns in the city of Bobo Dioulasso and on the study of spirit cults and religious change in Sambla communities west of Bobo Dioulasso. â€¦",2002,Africa

PS245. Outcome of naturalistic pharmacological treatment in panic disorder patients with the respiratory subtype,"s | 89 Abstract Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data acquired during semantic and phonological verbal fluency tasks were shown to allow for diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with 90% accuracy [1]. We demonstrate that the activation in the brain areas selected through the so-called group LASSO algorithm [2] applied in [1] significantly correlate with symptoms as well as other commonly MDD associated characteristics. 31 MDD patients and 31 age and sex matched healthy controls underwent a detailed interview, where following common MDD scores were assessed: BDI2, PHQ-9, HRSD17, GAF, CATS, LES, PANAS, STAI (for abbreviations see [3]). fMRI data acquired during a phonological and a semantic verbal fluency task were processed in conventional way and the activation-maps of all subjects subjected to the group LASSO algorithm [1]. This resulted in a weight map for each verbal fluency task. The mean brain activation during the respective tasks was calculated for each region of interest indicated in the maps. Finally, the correlation between each region of interest and the interview scores was evaluated. Five ROIs located in precentral cortex, pars triangularis, inferior frontal operculum, insula and postcentral gyrus of the left hemisphere showed significant correlation with the interview data (p<0.001). Correlated MDD characteristics were several depression severity measures (BDI, PHQ9, GAF), but also diathesis (CATS and negative LES) and specific symptoms (SHAPS, PANAS and STAI). All of the above, except for LES showed significant correlation with the post central gyrus. The results elucidate the relation of the brain areas relevant for the classification model evaluated in [1] with depression severity, diathesis and certain MDD characteristics. Even though causality remains to be investigated, the results give insight into how integrative effects might finally induce depression.Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data acquired during semantic and phonological verbal fluency tasks were shown to allow for diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with 90% accuracy [1].

Prodomain-Growth Factor Swapping in pro-TGF-b1 1 Prodomain-Growth Factor Swapping in the Structure of pro-TGF-b1,"Transforming growth factor (TGF)-b is synthesized as a proprotein that dimerizes in the endoplasmic reticulum. After processing in the Golgi to cleave the N-terminal prodomain from the C-terminal growth factor (GF) domain in each monomer, pro-TGF-b is secreted and stored in latent complexes. It is unclear which prodomain and GF monomer are linked prior to proprotein convertase (PC) cleavage, and how much conformational change occurs following cleavage. We have determined a structure of pro-TGF-Î²1 with the PC cleavage site mutated, to mimic the structure of the TGF-Î²1 proprotein. Structure, mutation, and model building demonstrate that the prodomain arm domain in one monomer is linked to the GF that interacts with the arm domain in the other monomer in the dimeric structure, i.e., the prodomain arm domain and GF domain in each monomer are swapped. Swapping has important implications for the mechanism of biosynthesis in the TGF-Î² family and is relevant to the mechanism for preferential formation of heterodimers over homodimers for some members of the TGF-Î² family. Our structure, together with two previous ones, also provides insights into which regions of the prodomain-GF complex are highly structurally conserved, and which are perturbed by crystal lattice contacts. INTRODUCTION The 33 members of the transforming growth factor-Î² (TGF-Î²) family include bone morphogenetic proteins, growth and differentiation factors, activins, and inhibins. They regulate all aspects of embryogenesis, major organ development, and homeostasis (1,2). TGF-Î²s 1-3 regulate development, cell fate, wound healing, and immune responses. TGF-Î² protein monomers are biosynthesized with an N-terminal prodomain of ~250 residues and a C-terminal growth factor (GF) domain of ~110 residues (3-5). In the endoplasmic reticulum, two monomers noncovalently associate and both the prodomain and GF domain are covalently linked into disulfide-linked dimers. At the same time, the TGF-Î² prodomain also associates with and becomes disulfide-linked to â€œmilieu moleculesâ€ such as latent TGF-Î² binding protein (LTBP) and glycoprotein-A repetitions predominant protein (GARP) (6-9). After transport to the Golgi, the polypeptide connection between the prodomain and GF is cleaved by a proprotein convertase. However, the GF remains strongly noncovalently bound to the prodomain, which keeps it latent during storage in extracellular milieus. ProdomainGF interfaces are not only important for latency but also for biosynthesis. The prodomain is required for proper folding and dimerization of the http://www.jbc.org/cgi/doi/10.1074/jbc.M117.809657 The latest version is at JBC Papers in Press. Published on November 5, 2017 as Manuscript M117.809657 Copyright 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc. by gest on N ovem er 8, 2017 hp://w w w .jb.org/ D ow nladed from Prodomain-Growth Factor Swapping in pro-TGF-b1 2 GF domain (10,11). The C-terminal GF domain folds either concomitantly with, or subsequently to, the N-terminal prodomain (10,12,13). The structure of the pro-TGF-Î²1 dimer reveals that the prodomain dimer surrounds the GF dimer (14). Two arm domain monomers with a jelly roll, Î²-sandwich fold dimerize and are disulfide linked at a bowtie knot and surround the GF on one side. On the other side, the N and Ctermini of the prodomain form a straitjacket that more loosely surround the GF. Each straitjacket monomer contains an Î±1-helix that intercalates between the two GF monomers, a latency lasso that wraps around the distal ends of each GF monomer, and an Î±2-helix that snuggles against the GF-arm domain interface. TGF-Î² cannot bind its receptors and signal until it is released from the prodomain, i.e. activated (15-17). TGF-Î²s 1 and 3 are activated by integrins that bind to a RGDLXXI/L motif in the prodomain (18). The motif locates to a long loop in the arm domain called the bowtie tail, because it follows the two bowtie cysteines that disulfide link the two prodomain monomers. A structure of an Î±VÎ²6 integrin head bound to one monomer of a TGF-Î² dimer showed that integrin binding stabilizes an alternative conformation of the bowtie tail (19). Activation by integrin Î±VÎ²6 requires force application by the actin cytoskeleton, which is resisted by the milieu molecule, resulting in distortion of the prodomain and release of the GF (9,15,16,19). The dimeric pro-TGF-Î²1 crystal structure suggested that there might be a swap between the prodomain and GF domain (14). In the structure, the straitjacket and arm domain on one side of the dimer dyad axis interacted much more with the monomer on the same than the other side of the dyad axis. The structure that suggested swapping was of mature pro-TGF-Î²1, which was cleaved between each prodomain and GF monomer. The C-terminus of one arm domain was closer to the N-terminus of one GF monomer than the other, and if these were linked in the original monomer, this monomer would correspond to the arm domain and GF on opposite sides of the dyad axis, with the smallest amount of noncovalent association in the final structure (14). In other words, there would have been a swap. Here, we have determined a structure of pro-TGF-Î²1 with the PC cleavage site mutated, to mimic the structure of the TGF-Î²1 pro-protein prior to PC cleavage. The previous structure of the Î±VÎ²6 integrin head bound to one monomer of a TGF-Î² dimer also utilized PC cleavage site mutated pro-TGF-Î²1 (19); however, there was no description of the structure around the cleavage site. Furthermore, the complex was less well resolved (3.5 Ã…) than the current pro-TGF-Î²1 structure (2.9 Ã…) and had more residues missing in density adjacent to the PC cleavage site. Our structure, and analysis of the complex structure, support arm domain-GF domain swapping. Swapping also has important implications because it can provide a mechanism for preferential formation of heterodimers over homodimers when a cell synthesizes monomers for two different TGF-Î² family members. Such heterodimers can display unique biological activities as in the case of BMP-2/7 heterodimers (20), and can alter activity as in the case of inhibin heterodimers compared to activin homodimers (12). To gain a more comprehensive understanding of pro-TGF-b1 structure, we also describe differences among three pro-TGF-Î²1 crystal structures that appear unrelated to prodomain cleavage and relate to differences in crystal lattice contacts and flexibility of specific regions in pro-TGF-b1. Analysis of structural changes in the i Î±VÎ²6 integrin complex with proTGF-Î²1 was limited to the region of contact between Î±VÎ²6 integrin and pro-TGF-Î²1 in the 5page report (19). Here, we take advantage of two previous structures containing pro-TGF-Î²1, and the current one, to provide the first comprehensive analysis of structural differences. These structural differences are relevant to TGF-Î² activation because rigidity is important for force transmission, and flexibility is important for release of the GF from the prodomain and for the ability of proTGF-Î²1 to covalently and noncovalently associate with structurally distinct milieu molecules (6-9). RESULTS Crystal structure of pro-TGF-Î²1 prior to furin cleavageâ€”We introduced an R249A mutation into the RHRR PC cleavage site between the prodomain and GF domain of human pro-TGF-Î²1. SDS-PAGE showed that the R249A mutant is >90% uncleaved whereas WT protein is almost completely cleaved (Fig.1A). Reducing SDS-PAGE of R249A mutant crystals showed a by gest on N ovem er 8, 2017 hp://w w w .jb.org/ D ow nladed from Prodomain-Growth Factor Swapping in pro-TGF-b1 3 band corresponding to uncleaved pro-TGF-b1 monomer (Fig. 1B), while porcine pro-TGF-b1 crystals show predominantly the cleaved prodomain (14). We determined a crystal structure to a resolution of 2.9 Ã… of human R249A mutant proTGF-Î²1 (Table 1, Fig. 2A). The structure contains one monomer in the asymmetric unit; the other monomer of the dimer shown in Figures is a symmetry mate. We also re-processed to higher resolution and re-refined the previously described, cleaved porcine pro-TGF-Î²1 structure (Table 2, Fig. 2B). Despite the increase in resolution from 3.05 to 2.9 Ã…, the overall quality of the re-refined model and its Rfree greatly improved (Table 2). The porcine, PC-cleaved structure has four crystallographically distinct monomers in the asymmetric unit but nonetheless has pseudosymmetry that resembles the symmetry of the human R249A mutant. Despite these overall similarities, the crystal lattice contacts show marked differences (Fig. 2C, D). Structurally conserved and variant regions of pro-TGF-Î²1â€”We first describe the overall structure of furin-mutant pro-TGF-b1 and compare it to previous pro-TGF-b1 structures before focusing on structural alterations around the PC cleavage site. Comparisons give insights into regions of pro-TGF-Î²1 that are flexible, and hence may be affected by lattice contacts in crystals, as opposed to regions of pro-TGF-Î²1 that are more structurally constrained. Studying these structural features is important in understanding pro-TGF-Î²1 biology including reshaping of the straitjacket region by applied force to release the GF in TGFÎ²1 activation, force transmission from the integrin binding site through the arm domain to the straitjacket, and the ability of the N-terminal portion of the prodomain to noncovalently associate with and disulfide link to structurally distinct milieu molecules (6-9). A single crystallographically unique furin-mutant pro-TGFb1 is present in the current structure. Four unique monomers are present in re-refined, cleaved, porcine pro-TGF-Î²1; since chains A and C and B and D are similar to one another, we only show chains C and D in figures. Four unique monomers are present in the Î±VÎ²6 complex with furin-mutant proTGF-Î² (19); since integrin-bound monomers D and H are similar and unbound monomers C and G are similar , we only show chains G and H in figures. These five prodomain mon",2017,
Inference and Verification of Probabilistic Graphical Models from High-Dimensional Data,"Probabilistic graphical modelling technique has been widely used to infer the causal relations in the network from high-dimensional data. One of the most challenging biological questions is the inference and verification of biological network, for example, gene regulatory network and signaling pathway, from high-dimensional omics data. Conditionally dependent genes and undirected network can be inferred from the independently and identically distributed static data, while the time series data can help reconstruct a directed network which is more important to our understanding of the complex biological system. Due to the curse of dimensionality and network sparsity, statistical inference algorithm alone is not efficient and realistic to infer and verify large networks. In this work, we propose a novel technique, which applies the dimensionality reduction, network inference and formal verification methods together to reconstruct some regulatory networks from the static and time-series microarray data. A graphical lasso algorithm is first applied to learn the structure of Gaussian graphical models from static data and infer some conditionally dependent genes. Then, an extended dynamic Bayesian network method is applied to reconstruct some weighted and directed networks from the time series data of selected genes, and also generate symbolic model verification code for model checking. Finally, we apply this technique to reconstruct and verify some regulatory networks in yeast and prostate cancer in response to stress and irradiation respectively for illustration.",2015,
Total recall : a plea for realism in models of the past,"Computer technologies make possible virtual reconstructions of ancient structures. In this paper we give a concise overview of the techniques we have used to build a detailed 3D model of the Antonine nymphaeum at the Sagalassos excavation site. These include techniques for 3D acquisition, texture modelling and synthesis, data clean-up, and visualisation. Our aim has been to build a maximally realistic but also veridical model. The paper is also meant as a plea to include such levels of detail into models where the data allow it. There is an ongoing debate whether high levels of detail, and photo-realistic visualisation for that matter, are desirable in the first place. Indeed, detailed models combined with photo-realistic rendering may convey an impression of reality, whereas they can never represent the situation like it really was. Of course, we agree that filling in completely hypothetical structures may be more misleading than it is informative. On the other hand, often good indications about these structures, or even actual fragments thereof, may be available. Leaving out any structures one is not absolutely sure about, combining basic geometric primitives, or adopting copy-and-paste methods â€“ all aspects regularly found with simple model building â€“ also entail dangers. Such models may fail to generate interest with the public and also if they do, may fail to illustrate ornamental sophistication or shape and pattern irregularities. * Corresponding author.",2004,
A Novel Multimodal Radiomics Model for Preoperative Prediction of Lymphovascular Invasion in Rectal Cancer,"Objective: To explore a new predictive model of lymphatic vascular infiltration (LVI) in rectal cancer based on magnetic resonance (MR) and computed tomography (CT). Methods: A retrospective study was conducted on 94 patients with histologically confirmed rectal cancer, they were randomly divided into training cohort (n = 65) and validation cohort (n = 29). All patients underwent MR and CT examination within 2 weeks before treatment. On each slice of the tumor, we delineated the volume of interest on T2-weighted imaging, diffusion weighted imaging, and enhanced CT images, respectively. A total of 1,188 radiological features were extracted from each patient. Then, we used the student t-test or Mannâ€“Whitney U-test, Spearman's rank correlation and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm to select the strongest features to establish a single and multimodal logic model for predicting LVI. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and calibration curves were plotted to determine how well they explored LVI prediction performance in the training and validation cohorts. Results: An optimal multi-mode radiology nomogram for LVI estimation was established, which had significant predictive power in training (AUC, 0.884; 95% CI, 0.803â€“0.964) and validation (AUC, 0.876; 95% CI, 0.721â€“1.000). Calibration curve and decision curve analysis showed that the multimodal radiomics model provides greater clinical benefits. Conclusion: Multimodal (MR/CT) radiomics models can serve as an effective visual prognostic tool for predicting LVI in rectal cancer. It demonstrated great potential of preoperative prediction to improve treatment decisions.",2020,Frontiers in Oncology
"[Seasonal and spatial structure of reef fish community in San Jose Island, Gulf of California, Mexico].","The Gulf of California is one of the most fish diverse areas of the Tropical Eastern Pacific Ocean. In spite of its economic value, few works have considered fish community studies for optimum management. With the aim to determine the seasonal and spatial variation of fish communities in eight locations around the San JosÃ© Island, some ecological research was conducted from March 2001 to February 2002. For this, visual censuses were used in 48 transects of 100x5m (500m2); specific analysis such as diversity values, the relative abundance and the biological value indexes were undertaken, and a principal component analysis applied. Our results clearly showed two climatic seasons of cold and warm waters. A total number of 26 608 organisms of 112 species and 76 genera of fishes were identified. We used the relative abundance index to determine the most important species, which were: Abudefduf troschelii, Thalassoma lucasanum, Stegastes rectifraenum, Mulloidichthys dentatus, Chromis atrilobata, Lutjanus argentiventris and Scarus ghobban. February was the month with the lowest diversity with a value of 3.12bits/ind. and October was the most diverse (4.13bits/ind.). According to the biological value index (BVI) and considering the climatic seasons, the fish species with the highest score during cold months were: A. troschelii, M. dentatus, S. ghobban, S. rectifraenum and T lucasanum. Besides, for warmer months, the same fish species were observed but in different order and abundance: A. troschelii, S. ghobban, S. rectifraenum, T lucasanum and M. dentatus. Using the biological value index, 13 species were those which had a higher overall score. The locations by the Eastern side of the island had a greater number of species and abundance of fish. The principal component analysis (PCA) applied using the seasonal data, species richness, diversity, equity, number of species and total abundance during the warmer months also a PCA within spatial data, showed that location in Punta Colorada had a high correlation with the number of species, diversity and total abundance.",2012,Revista de biologia tropical

"A Network and Machine Learning Approach to Factor, Asset, and Blended Allocation","The main idea of this article is to approach and compare factor and asset allocation portfolios using both traditional and alternative allocation techniques: inverse variance optimization, minimum-variance optimization, and centrality-based techniques from network science. Analysis of the interconnectedness between assets and factors shows that their relationship is strong. The authors compare the allocation techniques, considering centrality and hierarchal-based networks. They demonstrate the advantages of graph theory to explain the advantages to portfolio management and the dynamic nature of assets and factors with their â€œimportance score.â€ They find that asset allocation can be efficiently derived using directed networks, dynamically driven by both US Treasuries and currency returns with significant centrality scores. Alternatively, the inverse variance weight estimation and correlation-based networks generate factor allocation with favorable riskâ€“return parameters. Furthermore, factor allocation is driven mostly by the importance scores of the Famaâ€“Frenchâ€“Carhart factors: SMB, HML, CMA, RMW, and MOM. The authors confirm previous results and argue that both factors and assets are interconnected with different value and momentum factors. Therefore, a blended strategy comprising factors and assets can be defensible for investors. As argued in previous research, factors are much more overcrowded than assets. Therefore, the centrality scores help to identify the crowded exposure and build diversified allocation. The authors run LASSO regressions and show how the network-based allocation can be implemented using machine learning. TOPICS:Factor-based models, portfolio theory, portfolio construction Key Findings â€¢ The authors compare network-based asset and factor allocations and blended strategies and argue that network analysis can be used to derive allocation, monitor interactions, and provide additional layers of risk control mechanisms. â€¢ The authors find that factors and assets are strongly interconnected. Investors should pay close attention to currencies and the Famaâ€“Frenchâ€“Carhart factors (RMW, HML, CMA) because they have large centrality scores. â€¢ Using machine learning and predictive models, investors can find asset and factor allocation solutions. The authors argue that factor exposure is desired within asset allocation.",2020,The Journal of Portfolio Management
Bernoulli Change-point estimators with true identification property,"The change-point problem is reformulated as a penalized likelihood estimation problem. A new non-convex penalty function is introduced to allow consistent estimation of the number of change points, and their locations and sizes.

The asymptotic properties for the local solutions are established and numerical studies are conducted to highlight their performance. An application to copy number variation is discussed.",2016,
Comments on: l1-penalization for mixture regression models,"I would like to start my discussion by congratulating the authors on this fine piece of work. The model they have considered exhibits significant practical interest, as they nicely illustrate through their real-data example. At the same time it poses some interesting theoretical challenges, brilliantly addressed by the authors. I do not plan to discuss all of them, but rather will focus on the oracle properties of the proposed estimators. A very attractive feature of lasso-type estimators is that they allow one to do estimation and model selection in a single step, with a typically low computational cost. Trying to be a bit more precise, let us consider the usual linear regression model with Gaussian errors yi = si + ÏƒÎµi, i = 1, . . . , n, (1) with Îµi i.i.d. standard normal.

Enhanced classical dysphonia measures and sparse regression for telemonitoring of Parkinson's disease progression,"Dysphonia measures are signal processing algorithms that offer an objective method for characterizing voice disorders from recorded speech signals. In this paper, we study disordered voices of people with Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we demonstrate that a simple logarithmic transformation of these dysphonia measures can significantly enhance their potential for identifying subtle changes in PD symptoms. The superiority of the log-transformed measures is reflected in feature selection results using Bayesian Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) linear regression. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this enhancement in the emerging application of automated characterization of PD symptom progression from voice signals, rated on the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), the gold standard clinical metric for PD. Using least squares regression, we show that UPDRS can be accurately predicted to within six points of the clinicians' observations.",2010,"2010 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing"

SparSNP: Fast and memory-efficient analysis of all SNPs for phenotype prediction,"BackgroundA central goal of genomics is to predict phenotypic variation from genetic variation. Fitting predictive models to genome-wide and whole genome single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) profiles allows us to estimate the predictive power of the SNPs and potentially develop diagnostic models for disease. However, many current datasets cannot be analysed with standard tools due to their large size.ResultsWe introduce SparSNP, a tool for fitting lasso linear models for massive SNP datasets quickly and with very low memory requirements. In analysis on a large celiac disease case/control dataset, we show that SparSNP runs substantially faster than four other state-of-the-art tools for fitting large scale penalised models. SparSNP was one of only two tools that could successfully fit models to the entire celiac disease dataset, and it did so with superior performance. Compared with the other tools, the models generated by SparSNP had better than or equal to predictive performance in cross-validation.ConclusionsGenomic datasets are rapidly increasing in size, rendering existing approaches to model fitting impractical due to their prohibitive time or memory requirements. This study shows that SparSNP is an essential addition to the genomic analysis toolkit.SparSNP is available at http://www.genomics.csse.unimelb.edu.au/SparSNP",2012,BMC Bioinformatics

""Erne Geschichte der deutschsprachigen Gegenwartsliteratur, so international und provinziell, so mit der Vergangenheit hadernd und voll von Wiinschen, so spannend und differenziert, so lebenssuchtig und verzweifelt, so zerqualt und selbstbewust, so engagiert und ironisch, so intertextuell gelehrt und unbefangen neu, so verruckt und weise wie ihr Cegenstand: ein Traum, was sonst?"" (238), mit dieser Frage beschliesst Lutzeler seine Rezension von Hartmut Steineckes Literaturgeschichte (Deutsche Dichter des 20. Jahrhunderts, 1994), und ein solcher Wunschtraum hat vielleicht auch bei dem vorliegenden Band Pate gestanden. Obgleich nicht als literaturgeschichtlicher Uberblick angelegt, bietet Liitzelers Studie eine vorzugliche Darstellung postmoderner und postkolonialer Theorie und Literaturpraxis, in der weitausgreifende Zusammenfassungen internationaler Theoriediskurse Hand in Hand gehen mit detaillierten Interpretationen von Romanen, Poetikvorlesungen und Gattungen wie postkolonialen Reiseberichten. Lutzeler, Cermanist von Weltrang und einer der besten Kenner (und Forderer) der deutschsprachigen Gegenwartsliteratur prasentiert in diesem Band, der auf fruheren und teilweise stark uberarbeiteten wissenschaftlichen Publikationen und Rezensionen basiert, ein fundiertes und fulminantes Pladoyer fiir die Bedeutung und Verbreitung postmoderner und postkolonialer deutschsprachiger literatur. Diese Begriffe charakterisieren Strukturen, Themen und Autoren, die trotz ihrer Relevanz immer noch zu wenig in das Blickfeld traditioneller Germanistik und Literaturgeschichten geraten und gegen deren Randstellung der vorliegende Band argumentiert.

Angesichts des dynamischen und flexiblen Charakters der Postmoderne, die sowohl als Epochensignatur wie als Diskurskonzept fungieren kann, versucht Lutzeler diese nicht mit einem Definitionslasso einzufangen und in ein festes Paradigma zu zurren. Stattdessen beschreibt er Konstellationen und Merkmale, zu denenu.a. Stilpluralismus, AneignungvonPopularkultur, Selbstreflexion, Utopie-Skepsis sowie die Aufwertung der Peripherie gegenuber dem Zentrum gehoren, so dass ""man weniger von einem Bruch zwischen Moderne und Postmoderne sprechen kann als von einer postmodernen Selbstkritik der Moderne, von einer Art Durch- und Uberarbeitung der Moderne in der postmodernen Konstellation"" (32).

Rectal Microbiome Alterations Associated With Oral Human Immunodeficiency Virus Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis,"Background
Oral daily tenofovir (TFV) disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is highly effective for HIVprevention, yet long-term effects are not fully understood. We investigated the effects of PrEP on the rectal microbiome in a cohort of men who have sex with men (MSM).


Methods
This cross-sectional analysis included HIV-negative MSM either on PrEP (n = 37) or not (n = 37) selected from an ongoing cohort using propensity score matching. Rectal swabs were used to examine microbiome composition using 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid gene sequencing, and associations between PrEP use and microbiota abundance were examined. Hair specimens were used to quantify TFV and FTC exposure over the past 6 weeks on a subset of participants (n = 15).


Results
Pre-exposure prophylaxis use was associated with a significant increase in Streptococcus abundance (adjusted P = .015). Similar associations were identified using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, confirming the increase in Streptococcus and also showing increased Mitsuokella, Fusobacterium, and decreased Escherichia/Shigella. Increased Fusobacterium was significantly associated with increasing TFV exposure.


Conclusions
Oral TDF/FTC for PrEP is associated with rectal microbiome changes compared to well matched controls, specifically increased Streptococcus and Fusobacterium abundance. This study highlights the need for future investigations of the role of microbiome changes on HIV susceptibility and effectiveness of PrEP.",2019,Open Forum Infectious Diseases
Usurpation of an Interior Least Tern (Sternula antillarum athalassos) Nest by Piping Plovers (Charadrius melodus),"Abstract 
 Nest usurpation is a strategy in which an individual or pair of one species takes over the nest of another species. This is the first documented occurrence of a Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus) pair usurping an Interior Least Tern (Sternula antillarum athalassos) nest. The Piping Plovers incubated the three Interior Least Tern eggs in the nest, and all three eggs hatched. The adult Piping Plovers accompanied and brooded the Interior Least Tern chicks for 1 day post-hatching, but we did not see the adult Piping Plovers nor the Interior Least Tern chicks after that day. The Piping Plovers likely usurped the Interior Least Tern nest because they developed hormonemediated broodiness after they lost the eggs from their two previous nesting attempts. When the Piping Plovers encountered an unattended Interior Least Tern nest with eggs, they instinctively took the nest and its contents as their own.",2018,Waterbirds
GeneExpressScore Signature: a robust prognostic and predictive classifier in gastric cancer,"Although several prognostic signatures have been developed for gastric cancer (GC), the utility of these tools is limited in clinical practice due to lack of validation with large and multiple independent cohorts, or lack of a statistical test to determine the robustness of the predictive models. Here, a prognostic signature was constructed using a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression model and a training dataset with 300 GC patients. The signature was verified in three independent datasets with a total of 658 tumors across multiplatforms. A nomogram based on the signature was built to predict disease-free survival (DFS). Based on the LASSO model, we created a GeneExpressScore signature (GESGC ) classifier comprised of eight mRNA. With this classifier patients could be divided into two subgroups with distinctive prognoses [hazard ratio (HR)Â =Â 4.00, 95% confidence interval (CI)Â =Â 2.41-6.66, PÂ <Â 0.0001]. The prognostic value was consistently validated in three independent datasets. Interestingly, the high-GESGC group was associated with invasion, microsatellite stable/epithelial-mesenchymal transition (MSS/EMT), and genomically stable (GS) subtypes. The predictive accuracy of GESGC also outperformed five previously published signatures. Finally, a well-performed nomogram integrating the GESGC and four clinicopathological factors was generated to predict 3- and 5-year DFS. In summary, we describe an eight-mRNA-based signature, GESGC , as a predictive model for disease progression in GC. The robustness of this signature was validated across patient series, populations, and multiplatform datasets.",2018,Molecular Oncology
Structure and mutagenesis reveal essential capsid protein interactions for KSHV replication,"Kaposiâ€™s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) causes Kaposiâ€™s sarcoma, a cancer that commonly affects patients with AIDS and which is endemic in sub-Saharan Africa. The KSHV capsid is highly pressurized by its double-stranded DNA genome, as are the capsids of the eight other human herpesviruses. Capsid assembly and genome packaging of herpesviruses are prone to interruption and can therefore be targeted for the structure-guided development of antiviral agents. However, herpesvirus capsidsâ€”comprising nearly 3,000 proteins and over 1,300â€‰Ã… in diameterâ€”present a formidable challenge to atomic structure determination and functional mapping of molecular interactions. Here we report a 4.2â€‰Ã… resolution structure of the KSHV capsid, determined by electron-counting cryo-electron microscopy, and its atomic model, which contains 46 unique conformers of the major capsid protein (MCP), the smallest capsid protein (SCP) and the triplex proteins Tri1 and Tri2. Our structure and mutagenesis results reveal a groove in the upper domain of the MCP that contains hydrophobic residues that interact with the SCP, which in turn crosslinks with neighbouring MCPs in the same hexon to stabilize the capsid. Multiple levels of MCPâ€“MCP interactionâ€”including six sets of stacked hairpins lining the hexon channel, disulfide bonds across channel and buttress domains in neighbouring MCPs, and an interaction network forged by the N-lasso domain and secured by the dimerization domainâ€”define a robust capsid that is resistant to the pressure exerted by the enclosed genome. The triplexes, each composed of two Tri2 molecules and a Tri1 molecule, anchor to the capsid floor via a Tri1 N-anchor to plug holes in the MCP network and rivet the capsid floor. These essential roles of the MCP N-lasso and Tri1 N-anchor are verified by serial-truncation mutageneses. Our proof-of-concept demonstration of the use of polypeptides that mimic the smallest capsid protein to inhibit KSHV lytic replication highlights the potential for exploiting the interaction hotspots revealed in our atomic structure to develop antiviral agents.",2018,Nature
Irrigated-tip catheter ablation for electrical isolation of atrium-pulmonary vein to treat paroxysmal atrial fibrillation,"Objective To compare the effect between using saline irrigated-tip catheter and temperature control catheter ablation for electrical isolation of atrium-pulmonary vein(PV)to treat paroxysmal atrial fibrillation(AF).Methods The study population consisted of 26 patients(22 male and 4 female patients and aged 31 to 69 years)with AF.The patients were divided into 2 groups.Group 1 had 15 patients using common 4 mm tip temperature control catheter for electrical isolation of PV;and Group 2 had 11 patients using saline irrigated-tip catheter.3 or 4 PVs were isolated in each patient guided by circular mapping catheter(Lasso catheter).Results In Group 1,successful electrical isolation was obtained in 46 of 50(92%)PVs.The procedure time took 3.5 hours on the average.In 2 patients who had AF recurrence,the atrium-PV conduction recovered in 6 of the 7 PVs isolated at the former procedure.During a mean follow-up of 13 months,8 patients(53%)remained free of AF without medication including 2 patients who had a re-ablation procedure,and another 3 patients(20%)experienced remarkable reduction of AF episodes and duration.In Group 2,successful electrical isolation was obtained in all the 44(100%)PVs.The procedure time took 2.8 hours on the average.Acute cardiac tamponade occurred in 1 patient during radiofrequency ablation.During a mean follow-up of 4 months,7 patients(64%)remained symptom free with no evidence of AF,and another 2 patients(18%)experienced remarkable reduction of AF episodes and duration.Conclusions The ablation for electrical isolation of atrium-PV using saline irrigated-tip catheter might shorten the procedure time,increase the successful rate and reduce the recurrence by lowering the recovery of atrium-PV conduction.",2004,Chinese Journal of Cardiac Arrhythmias

Ces deux problemes sont elliptiques et leurs spectres sont constitues de suites de valeurs propres tendant vers l'infini. Le but de ce travail est l'etude du comportement asymptotique a l'infini des fonctions de comptage associees. L'etude de la fonction de comptage des valeurs propres pour des operateurs elliptiques a fait l'objet de nombreux travaux depuis weyl qui a donne le premier terme du developpement. Dans le cas de l'operateur de laplace-beltrami sur une variete compacte a bord regulier avec des conditions aux limites de dirichlet ou de neumann, ivrii a montre l'existence d'un second terme dans le developpement asymptotique de la fonction de comptage sous l'hypothese que l'ensemble des trajectoires periodiques du billard geodesique soit de mesure nulle. Vassilev a generalise ce resultat a des problemes aux limites d'ordre superieur, et a introduit avec saffarov la notion de billard branche qui permet de rendre compte du fait que les trajectoires peuvent se reflechir de plusieurs manieres en touchant le bord. Ici nous rencontrons le meme phenomene car le systeme de l'elasticite a deux vitesses de propagation des ondes. Nous classons les trajectoires periodiques en differents types suivant la nature des reflexions successives sur le bord, et pour un ouvert a bord reel analytique nous montrons que deux sous-ensembles de trajectoires periodiques sont de mesure nulle. Enfin nous demontrons un theoreme analogue a celui de vassilev, ou l'operateur d'ordre superieur a deux est remplace par un systeme d'ordre deux. Nous donnons des formules explicites du coefficient du second terme asymptotique dans les deux cas de conditions aux limites. Dans le cas de la condition de neumann, ce coefficient est relie a la vitesse de propagation de l'onde de rayleigh sur le bord",1995,
Regularization and model selection with categorical predictors and effect modifiers in generalized linear models,"Varying-coefficient models with categorical effect modifiers are considered within the framework of generalized linear models. We distinguish between nominal and ordinal effect modifiers, and propose adequate Lasso-type regularization techniques that allow for (1) selection of relevant covariates, and (2) identification of coefficient functions that are actually varying with the level of a potentially effect modifying factor. For computation, a penalized iteratively reweighted least squares algorithm is presented. We investigate large sample properties of the penalized estimates; in simulation studies, we show that the proposed approaches perform very well for finite samples, too. In addition, the presented methods are compared with alternative procedures, and applied to real-world data.",2014,Statistical Modelling
Turismo sostenible. SituaciÃ³n actual y perspectivas: un turismo sostenible en el Algarve,"espanolPretendemos demostrar que el Turismo, siendo una actividad en expansion y en el ambito internacional (crecimiento anual promedio del 6%, el crecimiento de PIB superior), tiene que adoptar una nueva estrategia integral territorial, especialmente en areas como el Algarve (Portugal) de gran tradicion y desarrollo. Por eso creemos que la faceta turistica, en el Algarve, la region mas representativa de Portugal del sol y mar (talasoterapia), es la ""industria"" que proporcionalmente mas empleo por inversion y el mas profesional sectores afecta (hoteles, restaurantes, transporte, guias, etc.). Por lo tanto, un plan estrategico con perspectiva holistica es la solucion para combinar el uso a largo plazo del territorio y de su conservacion, minimizando los impactos (ambientales y urbanos). Esta tesis si estos otros blog cuestiones y proponer abordar un modelo correcto de planificacion y gestion para el Algarve, en la escala municipal, en el cual hemos seleccionado el ""condado"" de Olhao, una es a la referencia de sostenibilidad para el futuro. Consideramos importante llevar a cabo el marco de lo que significa que el desarrollo sostenible. Para el turismo sostenible implica adoptar o mejorar nuestros comportamientos siguiendo determinados principios. Entre los que destacan: el principio de precaucion (prevencion de riesgos va mas alla de las leyes); el principio de responsabilidad (responsabilidad humana y ambiental para todas las actividades y decisiones que adopta); el principio de transparencia (informar, contribuir objetivamente de los hechos, aumentar la visibilidad de la informacion); el principio de contribucion a los desafios locales, nacionales y mundiales en materia turistica. EnglishWe intend to demonstrate that tourism being an activity in expansion and in the international arena ( average annual growth of 6 % , higher GDP growth ) has to adopt a new comprehensive strategy territorial, especially in areas such as the Algarve (Portugal) of great tradition and development. We therefore believe that the tourist aspect , in the Algarve , the most representative region of Portugal Sun and sea ( thalassotherapy), is the ""industry"" that proportionally more jobs by investment and professional sectors most affected (hotels, restaurants, transportation, guides, etc. ).

Tensor Graphical Lasso (TeraLasso),"The Bigraphical Lasso estimator was proposed to parsimoniously model the precision matrices of matrix-normal data based on the Cartesian product of graphs. By enforcing extreme sparsity (the number of parameters) and explicit structures on the precision matrix, this model has excellent potential for improving scalability of the computation and interpretability of complex data analysis. As a result, this model significantly reduces the size of the sample in order to learn the precision matrices, and hence the conditional probability models along different coordinates such as space, time and replicates. In this work, we extend the Bigraphical Lasso (BiGLasso) estimator to the TEnsor gRAphical Lasso (TeraLasso) estimator and propose an analogous method for modeling the precision matrix of tensor-valued data. We establish consistency for both the BiGLasso and TeraLasso estimators and obtain the rates of convergence in the operator and Frobenius norm for estimating the precision matrix. We design a scalable gradient descent method for solving the objective function and analyze the computational convergence rate, showing that the composite gradient descent algorithm is guaranteed to converge at a geometric rate to the global minimizer. Finally, we provide simulation evidence and analysis of a meteorological dataset, showing that we can recover graphical structures and estimate the precision matrices, as predicted by theory.",2017,arXiv: Methodology
Functional Analysis of the Human Telomeric Protein TRF2,"ITAGGG Repeat Binding Factor 2 (TRF2) is a ubiquitous human telomeric protein present at all telomeres throughout the cell cycle. TRF2 has been proposed to remodel telomeres into large lasso-like structures named t-loops. Removal of TRF2 from telomeres by expression of a dominant negative allele of TRF2 (TRF2ABAM) led to dissolution of these structures and appearance of end-to-end fusions visible in metaphase and anaphase cells. Fusion formation was accompanied by the loss of Goverhang, but not by the loss of double stranded telomeric DNA, which can be documented to persist at the sites of fusions. Fusions were covalent and their formation was dependent on the nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway as evidenced by the failure to form fusions in cells lacking Ligase IV. Furthermore, the fusions initiated genomic instability. Expression of TRF2ABAM in primary human cells resulted in induction of senescence. The arrested cells exhibited elevated levels of p53, stabilization of which was accompanied by induction of its downstream effectors p21 and Bax. The Rb pathway was also affected, with pRb becoming hypophosphorylated. The importance of both the p53 and the Rb pathways was further evident from the fact that the expression of SV40 Tag alone bypassed the growth arrest. Separate elimination of p53 or Rb function could not do so, and the activity of the ATM PI3 kinase was not necessary for the arrest. Expression of a different truncation allele of TRF2, TRF2AB also resulted in senescence but the growth arrest was accompanied by rapid loss of telomeric DNA. In addition, this allele induced an unanticipated chromosome breakage phenotype. Long-term overexpression of full length T R F 2 resulted in the gradual shortening of telomeres, suggesting that TRF2 is a regulator of telomere maintenance. Although it is clear that TRF2 acts through positively regulating the shortening activities at telomeres, it is unknown at this time whether it influences the telomerase pathway. Besides being present at telomeres, TRF2 also appears to be localized to centrosomes. The functional consequences of such localization are not known at this time; however, it is shown that telomere dysfunction can result in genome reduplication.",2001,
Reliable Detection of Î²-Thalassemia and G6PD Mutations by a DNA Microarray,"Î²-Thalassemia is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by the absence or reduction of Î²-globin chain synthesis. There are >400 million Î²-thalassemia carriers worldwide, and >160 Î²-thalassemia mutations have been described (1). Different populations exhibit a specific subset of mutations, as in Sardinia, where carriers are âˆ¼11% of the population and 95% of them present the Î² 39 mutation (1)(2)(3). In those populations, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is also common (4)(5)(6). For the G6PD gene, âˆ¼130 mutations or combinations of mutations have been described (7), and early detection might reduce the risk of hemolytic crisis in childhood. A program of screening newborns would be desirable in those populations. The molecular diagnosis of Î²-globin and G6PD mutations currently involves a combination of classic methodologies such as restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, allele-specific oligonucleotide (ASO) hybridization, reverse dot blots, amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS), and direct sequencing (2)(8)(9)(10)(11). These methods are laborious for large-scale screening.

We set up a microarray-based assay for parallel one-shot detection of 17 mutations commonly found in the Mediterranean population: Î²+ âˆ’101(Câ†’T); Î²+ âˆ’87(Câ†’G); Î² codon 6 (-A); Î² codon 39 (Câ†’T); Î²-IVSI-1 (Gâ†’A); Î²+-IVSI-6 (Tâ†’C); Î²+-IVSI-110 (Gâ†’A); Î²-IVSII-1 (Gâ†’A); Î²+-IVSII-745 (Câ†’G); Î²+-IVSII-844 (Câ†’G); G6PD Aâˆ’ variant (202Gâ†’A; 376Aâ†’G); Mediterranean variant (563Câ†’T); Seattle variant (844Gâ†’C); Montalbano variant (854Gâ†’A); S. Antioco variant (1342Aâ†’G); and Maewo (1360Câ†’T). We called this microarray â€œThalassochipâ€.

Thalassochip is based on the arrayed primer extension (APEX) technology (12) implemented with allele-specific primed extension (ASPEX) (13). APEX consists of a sequencing reaction primed by an oligonucleotide anchored to a glass slide (with its 5â€² end) terminating just one nucleotide before the mutation site. DNA polymerase extends it by adding one fluorescently labeled â€¦",2002,Clinical Chemistry
Conditional Granger Causality and Genetic Algorithms in VAR Model Selection,"Overcoming symmetry in combinatorial evolutionary algorithms is a challenge for existing niching methods. This research presents a genetic algorithm designed for the shrinkage of the coefficient matrix in vector autoregression (VAR) models, constructed on two pillars: conditional Granger causality and Lasso regression. Departing from a recent information theory proof that Granger causality and transfer entropy are equivalent, we propose a heuristic method for the identification of true structural dependencies in multivariate economic time series. Through rigorous testing, both empirically and through simulations, the present paper proves that genetic algorithms initialized with classical solutions are able to easily break the symmetry of random search and progress towards specific modeling.",2019,Symmetry
Predicting ship fuel consumption based on LASSO regression,"Abstract During the voyage, predicting fuel consumption of ships under different sea-states and weather conditions has been a challenging and far-reaching topic, because there are a great number of feature variables affecting the fuel consumption, including main-engine status, cargo weight, ship draft, sea-states and weather conditions, etc. Data driven statistical models have been employed to model the relationship between fuel consumption rate and these voyage parameters. However, some of the feature variables are highly correlated, e.g. wind speed and wave height, air pressure and wind force, cargo weight and draft etc., thus a typical multiple collinearity problem arises so that the fuel consumption cannot be accurately calculated by using the traditional multiple linear regression. In this study, the LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression algorithm is employed to implement the variable selection for these feature variables, additionally, it guides the trained predictor towards a generalizable solution, thereby improving the interpretability and accuracy of the model. On the basis of the LASSO, a novel ship fuel consumption prediction model is proposed. Experimentally, the superiority of the proposed method was confirmed by comparing it with some existing methods on predicting the fuel consumption. The proposed method is a promising development that improves the calculation of the fuel consumption.",2017,Transportation Research Part D-transport and Environment
The Relation between Outside of School Factors and Mathematics Achievement: A Cross-Country Study among the U.S. and Five Top-Performing Asian Countries.,"Since at least the 1980s, motivated, in part, by findings from international comparisons of studentsâ€™ mathematics achievement, some American (U.S.) educators and policy makers have initiated educational reform that focuses on improving teaching practices and curriculum designs by advocating for the adoption of Asian educational models. The implicit assumption behind such reform seems to overlook the possible roles of outside of school factors in superior academic performance in the Asian countries. The purpose of this study was to investigate how outside of school factors were related to studentsâ€™ TIMSS mathematics achievement for the U.S and five top-performing Asian nations or regions, and to examine whether the relative role of schoolassociated and outside of school factors was consistent across these five Asian countries. The results indicated that studentsâ€™ achievement was highly related to outside of school factors across all six countries. For Singapore and Hong Kong, school-associated factors had somewhat more salient roles than the outside of school factors. However, for Korea, Taiwan, and Japan, schoolassociated factors played lessor roles in studentsâ€™ achievement performance. As for the U.S., school-associated factors were related to studentsâ€™ performance, however outside of school factors clearly played more salient roles than the school-associated factors. The findings suggest that studentsâ€™ mathematics achievement covaries substantially with outside of school factors. Hence, studentsâ€™ superior mathematics achievement does not necessarily reflect only a superior public school system but also outside of school factors.",2006,

Performance measures for sparse spike inversion vs. basis pursuit inversion,Sparse Spike Inversion (SSI) and Basis Pursuit Inversion (BPI) are two methods for seismic inversion which utilize sparse inversion techniques.

We also show that flexible l1 penalization in the LASSO solution holds potential for improving performance.,2014,2014 IEEE 28th Convention of Electrical & Electronics Engineers in Israel (IEEEI)
A multimodal approach to distinguish MCI-C from MCI-NC subjects,"Alzheimerâ€™s Disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, affecting 60-80% from all dementia cases. Unfortunately, the cure for AD is still not known and only some treatments can be done in its early stages to slow up the symptoms and cognitive decline, avoiding worst patientsâ€™ living conditions. As most of the AD diagnoses are late, it increases the difficulty of applying the strategies and treatments available. Therefore, current studies aim at detecting AD at an early stage. For this purpose, they are studying mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects, as this is normally the first condition before developing AD. Nonetheless, not all MCI patients convert to AD, some remain stable or even may reverse the cognitive decline. In this sense, being able to distinguish between MCI-converters (MCI-C) and MCI-non converters (MCI-NC) reveals a quite important task. In order to distinguish between these and other groups of subjects many classifiers can be used. Classifiers are machine learning algorithms which apply artificial intelligence. These are extremely useful to identify patterns in, for example, medical brain images, to find disease related patterns and try to achieve an early and reliable diagnosis. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a widely used classifier for AD studies and is very appealing as it deals well with high-dimensional problems, which is present when using neuroimages because of the high number of voxels in each image. Nonetheless, SVM is a non-probabilistic classifier and only provides the class predicted for a given test. In a clinical perspective, it would be advantageous to also have a confidence level about the prediction made, to avoid diagnosis being hampered by overconfidence. Hence, of late the interest in probabilistic classifiers is rising. The Logistic Regression (LR) and the Gaussian Process (GP) are examples of probabilistic classifiers, but few studies used these methods to present results for AD classification, additionally the analysis of the posterior probability given by these classifiers is also still not well explored. In this context, this thesis proposes the comparison of the performance of probabilistic (LR and GP) and non-probabilistic (SVM) classifiers for AD context with special interest in reaching good results for MCI-C vs MCI-NC. These tests were done using two neuroimaging modalities: the deoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (FDG-PET) and structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (sMRI), in single modal and multimodal approach. A whole-brain approach was chosen, to avoid restringing the model just for certain brain regions. For feature selection methods, the LASSO and group LASSO with L1/L2 regularization, for both single and multimodality cases, were used respectively. Four different binary classification tests involving AD, MCI and elderly cognitive normal (CN) subjects from the Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database,",2016,
A General Framework of Dual Certificate Analysis for Structured Sparse Recovery Problems,"This paper develops a general theoretical framework to analyze structured sparse recovery problems using the notation of dual certificate. Although certain aspects of the dual certificate idea have already been used in some previous work, due to the lack of a general and coherent theory, the analysis has so far only been carried out in limited scopes for specific problems. In this context the current paper makes two contributions. First, we introduce a general definition of dual certificate, which we then use to develop a unified theory of sparse recovery analysis for convex programming. Second, we present a class of structured sparsity regularization called structured Lasso for which calculations can be readily performed under our theoretical framework. This new theory includes many seemingly loosely related previous work as special cases; it also implies new results that improve existing ones even for standard formulations such as L1 regularization.",2012,arXiv: Machine Learning
Variable Selection Properties of L1 Penalized Regression in Generalized Linear Models,"Title of dissertation: VARIABLE SELECTION PROPERTIES OF L1 PENALIZED REGRESSION IN GENERALIZED LINEAR MODELS Chon Sam, Doctor of Philosophy, 2008 Dissertation directed by: Professor Paul J. Smith A hierarchical Bayesian formulation in Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) is proposed in this dissertation. Under this Bayesian framework, empirical and fully Bayes variable selection procedures related to Least Absolute Selection and Shrinkage Operator (LASSO) are developed. By specifying a double exponential prior for the covariate coefficients and prior probabilities for each candidate model, the posterior distribution of candidate model given data is closely related to LASSO, which shrinks some coefficient estimates to zero, thereby performing variable selection. Various variable selection criteria, empirical Bayes (CML) and fully Bayes under the conjugate prior (FBC Conj), with flat prior (FBC Flat) a special case, are given explicitly for linear, logistic and Poisson models. Our priors are data dependent, so we are performing a version of objective Bayes analysis. Consistency of Lp penalized estimators in GLMs is established under regularity conditions. We also derive the limiting distribution of âˆš n times the estimation error for Lp penalized estimators in GLMs. Simulation studies and data analysis results of the Bayesian criteria mentioned above are carried out. They are also compared to the popular information criteria, Cp, AIC and BIC. The simulations yield the following findings. The Bayesian criteria behave very differently in linear, Poisson and logistic models. For logistic models, the performance of CML is very impressive, but it seldom does any variable selection in Poisson cases. The CML performance in the linear case is somewhere in between. In the presence of a predictor coefficient nearly zero and some significant predictors, CML picks out the significant predictors most of the time in the logistic case and fairly often in the linear case, while FBC Conj tends to select the significant predictors equally well in all linear, Poisson and logistic models. The behavior of fully Bayes criteria depends strongly on their chosen priors for the Poisson and logistic cases, but not in the linear case. From the simulation studies, the Bayesian criteria are generally more likely than Cp and AIC to choose correct predictors.",2008,
"First results on pollen and spores from the Paleocene/Eocene boundary interval of the Anthering section, Austria","Palynological investigations of the Anthering flysch section near Salzburg are here presented for the first time. According to the nannoplankton stratigraphy this section corresponds to the Biozones NP 9, NP 10, and NP 11. For the palynological study samples were collected and prepared from all outcrops at the type locality of the Anthering Formation. This formation is characterized by carbonate-rich mud-turbidites (silty marls) and intercalated hemipelagic claystones which occasionally have a total amount of organic carbon of up to 1% (Egger et al. 1997). The stratigraphical correlation is also possible on the basis of dinoflagellate cysts (Egger et al. in press). Only in a few layers in the Anthering section the abundance and diversity of pollen and spores was sufficient for palynological studies. The dark coloured claystones with a high content of organic carbon and abundant pyrite of section E and J (J1) contain pollen and spores in higher concentration, but moderate preservation. Pollen are damaged, most probably by mechanical abrasion during long-distance transport, and corroded. Using a scanning electron microscope combined with a light microscope (Zetter 1989) at least family or genus could be identified botanically which is absolutely necessary for paleoclimatic interpretation. The pollen assemblages from two samples of J1 around the negative carbon isotope excursion had the highest pollen concentration. The pollen and spore assemblage in J1 corresponds to the beginning of the benthonic foraminiferal extinction event. The sporomorphs are dominated by angiospermae and pteridophyta, whereas gymnospermae are very rare. Pteridophyta are represented by the families Gleicheniaceae, Schizeaceae (Cicatricosisporites sp., Lygodium?), and Adianthaceae (Polypodiaceoisporites sp., Pteris sp.). Gymnospermae include the families Pinaceae (Pinus sp.) and Taxodiaceae. Angiospermae: The pollen assemblages are dominated by triporate pollen types of Myricales/Juglandales. The fossil Normapolles element is rare: Nudopollis sp., Pompeckjoidaepollenites sp., Juglandaceae: Subtriporopollenites sp., Engelhardtia, Carya(?), Myricaceae. Angiospermae are represented also frequently by fossil Fagaceae. A number of other angiosperm taxa occur in single specimens: Mastixiaceae, Oleaceae, Verbenaceae, Icacinaceae (Compositoipollenties sp.), Sterculiaceae, Anacardiaceae (Rhus sp.), Platanaceae, Aquifoliaceae (Ilex sp.), Hamamelidaceae, Sapotaceae, Palmae. Some reworked pollen like Classopollis sp. probably from the lower Cretaceous are recorded. As far as the preserved taxa could have been attached to modern genera or families the pollen assemblage contains elements of the subtropical/tropical vegetation now occurring in southeast North America, southeast Asia, and other parts of the world. Fossil fruits of Icacinaceae have been found in the Eocene of St. Pankraz near Salzburg (Tichy 1979). Similar climatic conditions can be assumed for the Paleoceneâ€“Eocene transition in the sedimentation area of Anthering.",2000,GFF
Minimally Traumatic Techniques for In Utero Access and Fetal Surgery,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
Prenatal interventions may prevent some sequelae of congenital anomalies, yet open fetal surgery is limited by pre-term labor. We are developing amnioscopic strategies to reduce risks for in utero surgery.


METHODS
Seven fetal sheep were accessed percutaneously under ultrasound guidance, via maternal laparoscopy/transuterine trocars, or via laparoscopically assisted partial uterine exteriorization (mini-hysterotomy). Three fetal immobilization methods were investigated: 2 mm grasping forceps, 2-0 absorbable Roeder loop lasso, and detachable metal T-fasteners.


RESULTS
Percutaneous access with 2 mm trocars required accessible amniotic fluid pockets. The laparoscopically assisted method enabled 5 mm trocar placement under direct fetal visualization. Mini-hysterotomy avoided trocars and was leak-proof. 2 mm graspers enabled fetal manipulation with repeatable applications. Roeder loop sutures were not readily repositioned, and required two 3 mm or larger trocars. T-fasteners were easily deployed into fetal skin via the self-contained needle applicator with minimal hemorrhage. Cutaneous marks were present immediately from the grasper and T-fastener, but not at postoperative day 10. The Roeder loop produced no observable effects. All devices demonstrated adequate intrauterine performance.


CONCLUSIONS
Minimally invasive fetal surgery promises to lower maternal-fetal risks. All strategies permitted prolonged amnioscopy and fetal manipulation. The 2 mm grasper was easiest to use, producing no observable lasting trauma.",1998,JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons
AUTALASSO: an automatic adaptive LASSO for genome-wide prediction,"BackgroundGenome-wide prediction has become the method of choice in animal and plant breeding. Prediction of breeding values and phenotypes are routinely performed using large genomic data sets with number of markers on the order of several thousands to millions. The number of evaluated individuals is usually smaller which results in problems where model sparsity is of major concern. The LASSO technique has proven to be very well-suited for sparse problems often providing excellent prediction accuracy. Several computationally efficient LASSO algorithms have been developed, but optimization of hyper-parameters can be demanding.ResultsWe have developed a novel automatic adaptive LASSO (AUTALASSO) based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) optimization algorithm. The two major hyper-parameters of ADMM are the learning rate and the regularization factor. The learning rate is automatically tuned with line search and the regularization factor optimized using Golden section search. Results show that AUTALASSO provides superior prediction accuracy when evaluated on simulated and real bull data compared to the adaptive LASSO, LASSO and ridge regression implemented in the popular glmnet software.ConclusionsThe AUTALASSO provides a very flexible and computationally efficient approach to GWP, especially when it is important to obtain high prediction accuracy and genetic gain. The AUTALASSO also has the capability to perform GWAS of both additive and dominance effects with smaller prediction error than the ordinary LASSO.",2019,BMC Bioinformatics
Characterization of the equivalence of robustification and regularization in linear and matrix regression,"Sparsity is a key driver in modern statistical problems, from linear regression via the Lasso to matrix regression with nuclear norm penalties in matrix completion and beyond. In stark contrast to sparsity motivations for such problems, it is known in the field of robust optimization that a variety of vector regression problems, such as Lasso which appears as a loss function plus a regularization penalty, can arise by simply immunizing a nominal problem (with only a loss function) to uncertainty in the data. Such a robustification offers an explanation for why some linear regression methods perform well in the face of noise, even when these methods do not produce reliably sparse solutions. In this paper we deepen and extend the understanding of the connection between robustification and regularization in regression problems. Specifically, (a) in the context of linear regression, we characterize under which conditions on the model of uncertainty used and on the loss function penalties robustification and regularization are equivalent; (b) we show how to tractably robustify median regression problems; and (c) we extend the characterization of robustification and regularization to matrix regression problems (matrix completion and Principal Component Analysis).",2018,Eur.

High dimensional Single Index Bayesian Modeling of the Brain Atrophy over time,"We study the effects of gender, APOE genes, age, genetic variation and Alzheimer's disease on the atrophy of the brain regions. In the real data analysis section, we add a subject specific random effect to capture subject inhomogeneity. A nonparametric single index Bayesian model is proposed to study the data with B-spline series prior on the unknown functions and Dirichlet process scale mixture of zero mean normal prior on the distributions of the random effects. Posterior consistency of the proposed model without the random effect is established for a fixed number of regions and time points with increasing sample size. A new Bayesian estimation procedure for high dimensional single index model is introduced in this paper. Performance of the proposed Bayesian method is compared with the corresponding least square estimator in the linear model with LASSO and SCAD penalization on the high dimensional covariates. The proposed Bayesian method is applied on a dataset of 748 individuals with 620,901 SNPs and 6 other covariates for each individual.",2017,arXiv: Methodology
Estuarine Lago Mare fauna from the Tertiary Piedmont Basin indicates episodic Atlantic/Mediterranean exchange during the final stage of the Mediterranean Salinity Crisis,"Abstract The geochemical signature of fossils from Lago Mare deposits at Moncucco Torinese (NW Italy) indicates a temporary marine ingression into the Tertiary Piedmont Basin just before the Miocene/Pliocene boundary. Isotope (Î´18O, Î´13C, 87Sr/86Sr) and trace element (Sr/Ca, Ba/Ca) data from mollusk shells of multiple species and croaker otoliths indicate an upper estuarine environment with considerable seasonal variability in evaporation and freshwater input. Reconstructed salinitiesÂ  The presence of a paralic paleobiotope with thalassogenic water in the Tertiary Piedmont Basin contradicts ideas of the Mediterranean as a brackish lake fed by the Paratethys during the latest stage of the Mediterranean Salinity Crisis. Instead, our data support previous notions of temporary Atlantic/Mediterranean exchange during sea-level highstands preceding the permanent re-connection at the Miocene/Pliocene transition. The establishment of short-lived and disjunct estuarine and lagoonal environments such as in the Tertiary Piedmont Basin during marine ingressions also puts highly variable 87Sr/86Sr values and occurrences of shallow water benthic foraminifera in Lago Mare deposits of other Mediterranean basins into a new perspective.",2016,"Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology"
Detecting maternal morbidity and mortality by traditional birth attendants in burkina faso,In Burkina Faso health workers from maternity units in the provinces of Bobo-Dioulasso Koudougou and Zabre trained 2 traditional birth attendants (TBAs) from each of 142 villages in these provinces in aseptic obstetric techniques and in recognizing the signs and symptoms indicating the need to refer and evacuate women during pregnancy and delivery. In 1986-1987 researchers gathered operational file cards on 6129 women who sought care from a TBA at least once and analyzed the data to evaluate the TBA training program and to determine obstetrical coverage. Registration only covered 31.1% of forecasted pregnancies but it did increase significantly over the 2 years (25.7-34.4%; p < .01). TBAs provided prenatal monitoring to 91% of the women mostly in their homes (92.4%). The leading prenatal risks detected were in order of frequency fever bleeding anemia edema and severe vomiting. they successfully referred 70% to the closest health facility. Complications occurred in 3.7% of all deliveries. Obstructed labor accounted for 38.2% of complications followed by abnormal presentations (17.3%) and hemorrhage (13.2%). 145 women had to be evacuated due to delivery complications. 2% of women examined postpartum experienced problems. It was difficult to determine the problems however because of undetailed diagnoses. Among the detailed diagnoses hemorrhage was the leading problem (15.9%). 27 mothers died (a mortality ratio of 452/10000). The researchers assumed this to be low however because the file cards did not state the condition for 150 mothers. 16 mothers died postpartum. 10 deceased mothers had no complications. The perinatal mortality rate was 40.4/1000.,1993,Health Policy and Planning

Statistical approach for the enhanced production of cold-active Î²-galactosidase from Thalassospira frigidphilosprofundus: a novel marine psychrophile from deep waters of Bay of Bengal.,"In the present investigation Thalassospira frigidphilosprofundus, a novel species from the deep waters of the Bay of Bengal, was explored for the production of cold-active Î²-galactosidase by submerged fermentation using marine broth medium as the basal medium. Effects of various medium constituents, namely, carbon, nitrogen source, pH, and temperature, were investigated using a conventional one-factor-at-a-time method. It was found that lactose, yeast extract, and bactopeptones are the most influential components for Î²-galactosidase production. Under optimal conditions, the production of Î²-galactosidase was found to be 3,864Â U/mL at 20Â Â±Â 2Â°C, pH 6.5Â Â±Â 0.2, after 48Â hr of incubation. Î²-Galactosidase production was further optimized by the Taguchi orthogonal array design of experiments and the central composite rotatable design (CCRD) of response surface methodology. Under optimal experimental conditions the cold-active Î²-galactosidase enzyme production from Thalassospira frigidphilosprofundus was enhanced from 3,864Â U/mL to 10,657Â U/mL, which is almost three times higher than the cold-active Î²-galactosidase production from the well-reported psychrophile Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis.",2013,Preparative biochemistry & biotechnology

Scalable and Robust Sparse Subspace Clustering Using Randomized Clustering and Multilayer Graphs,"Sparse subspace clustering (SSC) is one of the current state-of-the-art method for partitioning data points into the union of subspaces, with strong theoretical guarantees. However, it is not practical for large data sets as it requires solving a LASSO problem for each data point, where the number of variables in each LASSO problem is the number of data points. To improve the scalability of SSC, we propose to select a few sets of anchor points using a randomized hierarchical clustering method, and, for each set of anchor points, solve the LASSO problems for each data point allowing only anchor points to have a non-zero weight (this reduces drastically the number of variables). This generates a multilayer graph where each layer corresponds to a different set of anchor points. Using the Grassmann manifold of orthogonal matrices, the shared connectivity among the layers is summarized within a single subspace. Finally, we use $k$-means clustering within that subspace to cluster the data points, similarly as done by spectral clustering in SSC. We show on both synthetic and real-world data sets that the proposed method not only allows SSC to scale to large-scale data sets, but that it is also much more robust as it performs significantly better on noisy data and on data with close susbspaces and outliers, while it is not prone to oversegmentation.",2019,ArXiv
A Generally Efficient Targeted Minimum Loss Based Estimator based on the Highly Adaptive Lasso,"Abstract Suppose we observe n $n$ independent and identically distributed observations of a finite dimensional bounded random variable. This article is concerned with the construction of an efficient targeted minimum loss-based estimator (TMLE) of a pathwise differentiable target parameter of the data distribution based on a realistic statistical model. The only smoothness condition we will enforce on the statistical model is that the nuisance parameters of the data distribution that are needed to evaluate the canonical gradient of the pathwise derivative of the target parameter are multivariate real valued cadlag functions (right-continuous and left-hand limits, (G. Neuhaus. On weak convergence of stochastic processes with multidimensional time parameter. Ann Stat 1971;42:1285â€“1295.) and have a finite supremum and (sectional) variation norm. Each nuisance parameter is defined as a minimizer of the expectation of a loss function over over all functions it its parameter space. For each nuisance parameter, we propose a new minimum loss based estimator that minimizes the loss-specific empirical risk over the functions in its parameter space under the additional constraint that the variation norm of the function is bounded by a set constant. The constant is selected with cross-validation. We show such an MLE can be represented as the minimizer of the empirical risk over linear combinations of indicator basis functions under the constraint that the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients is bounded by the constant: i.e., the variation norm corresponds with this L1 $L_1$-norm of the vector of coefficients. We will refer to this estimator as the highly adaptive Lasso (HAL)-estimator. We prove that for all models the HAL-estimator converges to the true nuisance parameter value at a rate that is faster than nâˆ’1/4 $n^{-1/4}$ w.r.t. square-root of the loss-based dissimilarity. We also show that if this HAL-estimator is included in the library of an ensemble super-learner, then the super-learner will at minimal achieve the rate of convergence of the HAL, but, by previous results, it will actually be asymptotically equivalent with the oracle (i.e., in some sense best) estimator in the library. Subsequently, we establish that a one-step TMLE using such a super-learner as initial estimator for each of the nuisance parameters is asymptotically efficient at any data generating distribution in the model, under weak structural conditions on the target parameter mapping and model and a strong positivity assumption (e.g., the canonical gradient is uniformly bounded). We demonstrate our general theorem by constructing such a one-step TMLE of the average causal effect in a nonparametric model, and establishing that it is asymptotically efficient.",2017,The International Journal of Biostatistics

In orderto achievedynamicconsistenc y, object-oriented developmentprocesseslike theUnifiedProcess[10] extend thestaticobjectmodelby adescriptionof theoverallworkflows or businessprocessesthat are or shall be supported by the integratedapplication.A notion of view taking into accountthis dynamicaspectis proposed, e.g.,in [6], where the operationson objectsaredescribedby graphtransformationrules.A view inducesa projectionof this globally specifiedbehavior to theclientapplicationsthusfixing their individual role andfunctionin theoverallprocess. Horizontal consistency of architecture. Whenintegrating previously independentapplications,problems arise from incompatibleprotocolsor data formats which have to be adaptedand translatedinto eachother, respecti vely. Oneway of avoiding this is the definition of architectural stylesspecifyingkits of componentsandconnectorswhich canbecombinedfreelywhile ensuringinteroperability. The definition of architecturalstylesis supportedby architectural descriptionlanguageslike WRIGHT [21] or DARWIN [14]. Thesearespecializedmodelinglanguageswhich allow to describethe behavior of componentsandconnectors by meansof processcalculi or abstractprogramming languages.Object-orientedapproacheslike UML/RT use statechart diagramsfor this purpose.

Again, a model is required which specifiesbothnetwork changesandresultingreconfigurationsat thesoftwarearchitecturelevel. Relatively little supportis provided for this problemso far.

Effects of univariate and multivariate regression on the accuracy of hydrogen quantification with laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy,"Abstract Hydrogen (H) is a critical element to measure on the surface of Mars because its presence in mineral structures is indicative of past hydrous conditions. The Curiosity rover uses the laser-induced breakdown spectrometer (LIBS) on the ChemCam instrument to analyze rocks for their H emission signal at 656.6Â nm, from which H can be quantified. Previous LIBS calibrations for H used small data sets measured on standards and/or manufactured mixtures of hydrous minerals and rocks and applied univariate regression to spectra normalized in a variety of ways. However, matrix effects common to LIBS make these calibrations of limited usefulness when applied to the broad range of compositions on the Martian surface. In this study, 198 naturally-occurring hydrous geological samples covering a broad range of bulk compositions with directly-measured H content are used to create more robust prediction models for measuring H in LIBS data acquired under Mars conditions. Both univariate and multivariate prediction models, including partial least square (PLS) and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso), are compared using several different methods for normalization of H peak intensities. Data from the ChemLIBS Mars-analog spectrometer at Mount Holyoke College are compared against spectra from the same samples acquired using a ChemCam-like instrument at Los Alamos National Laboratory and the ChemCam instrument on Mars. Results show that all current normalization and data preprocessing variations for quantifying H result in models with statistically indistinguishable prediction errors (accuracies) ca. Â±Â 1.5Â weight percent (wt%) H2O, limiting the applications of LIBS in these implementations for geological studies. This error is too large to allow distinctions among the most common hydrous phases (basalts, amphiboles, micas) to be made, though some clays (e.g., chlorites with â‰ˆÂ 12Â wt% H2O, smectites with 15â€“20Â wt% H2O) and hydrated phases (e.g., gypsum with â‰ˆÂ 20Â wt% H2O) may be differentiated from lower-H phases within the known errors. Analyses of the H emission peak in Curiosity calibration targets and rock and soil targets on the Martian surface suggest that shot-to-shot variations of the ChemCam laser on Mars lead to variations in intensity that are comparable to those represented by the breadth of H standards tested in this study.",2018,Spectrochimica Acta Part B: Atomic Spectroscopy
Application of Penalized Regression Techniques in Modelling Insulin Sensitivity by Correlated Metabolic Parameters,"This paper aims to introduce penalized estimation techniques in clinical investigations of diabetes, as well as to assess their possible advantages and limitations. Data from a previous study was used to carry out the simulations to assess: a) which procedure results in the lowest prediction error of the final model in the setting of a large number of predictor variables with high multicollinearity (of importance if insulin sensitivity should be predicted) and b) which procedure achieves the most accurate estimate of regression coefficients in the setting of fewer predictors with small unidirectional effects and moderate correlation between explanatory variables (of importance if the specific relation between an independent variable and insulin sensitivity should be examined). Moreover a special focus is on the correct direction of estimated parameter effects, a non-negligible source of error and misinterpretation of study results. The simulations were performed for varying sample size to evaluate the performance of LASSO, Ridge as well as different algorithms for Elastic Net. These methods were also compared with automatic variable selection procedures (i.e. optimizing AIC or BIC).We were not able to identify one method achieving superior performance in all situations. However, the improved accuracy of estimated effects underlines the importance of using penalized regression techniques in our example (e.g. if a researcher aims to compare relations of several correlated parameters with insulin sensitivity). However, the decision which procedure should be used depends on the specific context of a study (accuracy versus complexity) and moreover should involve clinical prior knowledge.",2015,PLoS ONE
High-Sensitivity Determination of Nutrient Elements in Panax notoginseng by Laser-induced Breakdown Spectroscopy and Chemometric Methods,"High-accuracy and fast detection of nutritive elements in traditional Chinese medicine Panax notoginseng (PN) is beneficial for providing useful assessment of the healthy alimentation and pharmaceutical value of PN herbs. Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) was applied for high-accuracy and fast quantitative detection of six nutritive elements in PN samples from eight producing areas. More than 20,000 LIBS spectral variables were obtained to show elemental differences in PN samples. Univariate and multivariate calibrations were used to analyze the quantitative relationship between spectral variables and elements. Multivariate calibration based on full spectra and selected variables by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) weights was used to compare the prediction ability of the partial least-squares regression (PLS), least-squares support vector machines (LS-SVM), and Lasso models. More than 90 emission lines for elements in PN were found and located. Univariate analysis was negatively interfered by matrix effects. For potassium, calcium, magnesium, zinc, and boron, LS-SVM models based on the selected variables obtained the best prediction performance with Rp values of 0.9546, 0.9176, 0.9412, 0.9665, and 0.9569 and root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) of 0.7704 mg/g, 0.0712 mg/g, 0.1000 mg/g, 0.0012 mg/g, and 0.0008 mg/g, respectively. For iron, the Lasso model based on full spectra obtained the best result with an Rp value of 0.9348 and RMSEP of 0.0726 mg/g. The results indicated that the LIBS technique coupled with proper multivariate chemometrics could be an accurate and fast method in the determination of PN nutritive elements for traditional Chinese medicine management and pharmaceutical analysis.",2019,Molecules
A sparse representation-based method for parcellation of the resting brain and its application to treatment-resistant major depressive disorder,"BACKGROUND
Parcellating brain regions into functionally homogeneous subdivisions is critical for understanding normal and abnormal brain functions.


NEW METHOD
In this study, we developed a new sparse representation-based parcellation method for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, and applied the new method to investigate functional insular subdivisions in treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (MDD). Realistic simulations were implemented to demonstrate the feasibility of the method. Subsequently, the method was used to parcellate the insula in a sample of fifty-six MDD patients and thirty-six healthy volunteers (HVs). The optimal number of clusters was determined by an independent test-retest dataset. Finally, differences of the functional connectivity profiles of each insular subdivision between patients and HVs were inspected.


RESULTS
The results from both simulated and test-retest fMRI datasets demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed elastic net-based (EN) method. With the proposed method, the insula was parcellated into four subdivisions (dorsal anterior dAI; ventral anterior vAI; middle, MI and posterior, PI). Whereas patients showed hypo-connectivity between vAI and right medial temporal lobe, there were no functional volumetric differences in insular subdivisions between MDD patients and HVs.


COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD
Results from both simulated and real fMRI datasets showed that the proposed EN method achieved higher accuracy than least absolute shrinkage and selection operator-based (LASSO) method.


CONCLUSIONS
These findings suggest that EN-based parcellation has the potential to be a useful addition to the parcellation techniques for fMRI data, and provide evidence of decreased functional connectivity without functional volumetric changes of the insula in treatment-resistant MDD.",2017,Journal of Neuroscience Methods
Reliability and extremum principles in structural analysis,"SommarioDopo una breve esposizione della concezione probabilistica della sicurezza delle strutture, in relazione anche alle recenti teorie fondate sul concetto di stati limiti, si considera il problema di valutare la probabilitÃ  che la struttura subisca il collasso, inteso appunto come raggiungimento di uno degli assegnati stati limiti, nell'eventualitÃ  che alcune delle sue proprietÃ  fisicomeccaniche siano considerate come variabili aleatorie.Nell'ipotesi che la risposta della struttura a un assegnato sistema di carichi debba soddisfare a una condizione estremale, si mostra come sia possibile costruire una funzione di probabilitÃ  definita in una particolare classe di sottoinsiemi di possibili risposte della struttura.Un esempio numerico, relativo a un semplice portale di materiale elastico-perfettamente-plastico, illustra un possibile modo di procedere nel caso si debbano limitare le deformazioni piastiche sotto incertezza delle resistenze locali del materiale.SummaryAfter a brief introduction to the probabilistic analysis of safety, in relation also with the recent theories founded on limit states philosophy, the problem to calculate, or to bound, the collapse probability of the structure is approached in the paper, assuming that mechanical properties of the structures must be quantified as random variables.It is shown that, if the structural response to loading must satisfy an extremal condition, a probability function can be defined over a particular class of subsets of the set of all possible responses.A numerical example, pertaining to a one-bay elastic-perfectly-plastic frame, illustrates a possible procedure to control plastic deformations under uncertainty of the local strength of the material.",1975,Meccanica
On Stochastic Primal-Dual Hybrid Gradient Approach for Compositely Regularized Minimization,"We consider a wide spectrum of regularized stochastic minimization problems, where the regularization term is composite with a linear function. Examples of this formulation include graph-guided regularized minimization, generalized Lasso and a class of l1 regularized problems. The computational challenge is that the closed-form solution of the proximal mapping associated with the regularization term is not available due to the imposed linear composition. Fortunately, the structure of the regularization term allows us to reformulate it as a new convex-concave saddle point problem which can be solved using the Primal-Dual Hybrid Gradient (PDHG) approach. However, this approach may be inefficient in realistic applications as computing the full gradient of the expected objective function could be very expensive when the number of input data samples is considerably large. To address this issue, we propose a Stochastic PDHG (SPDHG) algorithm with either uniformly or non-uniformly averaged iterates. Through uniformly averaged iterates, the SPDHG algorithm converges in expectation with O(1/âˆšt) rate for general convex objectives and O(log(t)/t) rate for strongly convex objectives, respectively. While with non-uniformly averaged iterates, the SPDHG algorithm is expected to converge with O(1/t) rate for strongly convex objectives. Numerical experiments on different genres of datasets demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms other competing algorithms.",2016,
Il sistema di reclutamento dei nuovi docenti e la politica istituzionale della AIPDP,"EnglishThe author deals with two distinct problems, of which the first concerns the discipline of university competitions due to the Gelmini law. The fact that the same disciplines them in two phases, the one national draws defined scientific skill and the second local instead at the University that calls the competition, obviously in order to avoid co-optations, not only does not appear to be achieved this result but above all that various critical points were presented, which the author examines in detail and which, for various reasons, would recommend the return to a single competition. The second part of the essay concerns instead the institutional policy in particular of the AIPDP, characterized by a very ambitious goal, that is to elaborate a sort of alternative project of the penal code, which, if it can provide very interesting ideas already for the legislator, if he knows how to seize them, he still needs a considerable amount of time to be completed and this represents his greatest criticality. Another profile is the one more generally for which these types of associations are, generally, in balance between themes of a general nature and more specific themes, as demonstrated by that of the next AIPDP conference. However, in this dilemma between the general and the particular lies the difficulty for the association to usefully confront itself with other criminal organizations and more generally juridical organizations, such as the UCPI and the ANM, awaiting direct contact with the legislator himself. italianoLâ€™autore affronta due problematiche distinte di cui la prima riguarda la disciplina dei concorsi universitari dovuti alla legge Gelmini. Il fatto che la stessa li disciplini in due fasi, lâ€™una nazionale a sorteggio definita abilitazione scientifica e la seconda invece locale presso lâ€™Universita che chiama il concorso, allo scopo evidentemente di evitare cooptazioni, non solo non appare che si sia raggiunto tale risultato ma soprattutto che si sono presentate diverse criticita, che lâ€™autore esamina partitamente e che per varie ragion consiglierebbero il ritorno ad un concorso unico. La seconda parte del saggio riguarda invece la politica istituzionale in particolare dellâ€™AIPDP, caratterizzata da un obiettivo assai ambizioso, cioe quello di elaborare una sorta di progetto alternativo di codice penale, che, se puo fornire spunti assai interessanti gia allo stato per il legislatore, se li sapra cogliere, tuttavia necessita di un notevole lasso di tempo per essere ultimato e cio rappresenta la sua maggiore criticita. Altro profilo e quello piu in generale per cui tali tipi di associazioni sono, in genere, in bilico fra temi di carattere generale e temi piu specifici, come dimostra quello del prossimo convegno dellâ€™AIPDP.

"Distribution of prokaryotic genetic diversity in athalassohaline lakes of the Atacama Desert, Northern Chile.","Athalassohaline lakes are inland saline aquatic environments with ionic proportions quite different from the dissolved salts in seawater. Prokaryotes inhabiting athalassohaline environments are poorly known and very few of such places have been surveyed for microbial diversity studies around the world. We analyzed the planktonic bacterial and archaeal assemblages inhabiting several of these evaporitic basins in a remote and vast area in northern Chile by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and sequencing of 16S rRNA gene fragments. Most systems were springs and athalassohaline ponds in different saltflats of the Atacama Desert region, including Salar de LlamarÃ¡ (in the Central Depression), Salar de Atacama (in the Pre-Andean Depression) and Salar de AscotÃ¡n (in the Altiplano). Overall, we analyzed more than 25 samples from 19 different environments with strong gradients of altitude, qualitative ionic compositions and UV influence. Between 4 and 25 well-defined DGGE bands were detected for Bacteria in each sample, whereas Archaea ranged between 1 and 5. Predominant DGGE bands (defined by intensity and frequency of appearance) were excised from the gel and sequenced. Bacterial assemblages were dominated by the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides (CFB) phylum and a few Proteobacteria. There was a tendency for increasing contribution of CFB with higher salinities and altitude. Thus, CFB accounted for the major fraction of band intensity in the AscotÃ¡n samples and for lower percentages in Atacama and LlamarÃ¡. When the distribution of particular CFB sequences was examined, there were several relatives of Psychroflexus torquis substituting each other as salinity changed in AscotÃ¡n. Another set of CFB sequences, very distantly related to Cytophaga marinovorus, was abundant in both LlamarÃ¡ and Atacama at salinities lower than 7%. Archaeal assemblages were dominated by uncultured haloarchaea distantly related to cultured strains mostly obtained from thalassohaline environments. Most of the archaeal sequences did not have a close match with environmental 16S rRNA genes deposited in the database either. Therefore, athalassohaline environments are excellent sources of new microorganisms different from their counterparts in thalassohaline sites and useful tools to relate microbial genetic diversity and environmental characteristics such as changes in salinity (both qualitative and quantitative) and altitude.",2004,FEMS microbiology ecology
Exploratory Determined Correlates of Physical Activity in Children and Adolescents: The MoMo Study,"Background: Physical activity is an important contributor to reducing the risk for a variety of diseases. Understanding why people are physically active contributes to evidence-based planning of public health interventions because successful actions will target factors known to be related to physical activity (PA). Therefore the aim of this study is to identify the most meaningful correlates of PA in children and adolescents using a large, representative data set. Methods: Among n = 3539 (1801 boys) 6 to 17-year-old participants of the German representative Motorik-Modul baseline study (2003â»2006) a total of 1154 different demographic, psychological, behavioral, biological, social and environmental factors were ranked according to their power of predicting PA using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regressions. Results: A total of 18 (in girls) and 19 (in boys) important PA predictors from different, personal, social and environmental factors have been identified and ranked by LASSO. Peer modeling and physical self-concept were identified as the strongest correlates of PA in both boys and girls. Conclusions: The results confirm that PA interventions must target changes in different categories of PA correlates, but we suggest to focus particularly on the social environment and physical self-concept for interventions targeting children and adolescents in Germany nowadays. We also strongly recommend to repeatedly track correlates of PA, at least every 10 years, from representative samples in order to tailor contemporary PA interventions.",2019,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health
The Multifaceted Impact of Statistical Methodology and Theory in Data Science,"The vast amount of recorded data and the exponential growth of computational power in the last two decades have enabled the extraction and processing of information in unprecedented ways. This has led to the emergence of data science as a bridge between data mining, algorithm design, modeling, machine learning, visualization, and artificial intelligence, in an effort to understand and gain deeper insights from data in various forms. In turn, this has caused a resurgence of statistical science, due to the prominent role of statistical methodology and statistical theory in data science. This special issue of Mathematics for Applications features a compilation of contributions dealing with the multifaceted impact of statistical methodology and theory in data science. The works featured in this special issue have initially been reported at the conferences UP-STAT 2016 â€œData Science, Statistical Practice, and Educationâ€ and UP-STAT 2017 â€œData Science, Statistics, and the Environment.â€ After a careful selection and a rigorous review process, seven substantially extended papers out of over 100 works presented at both conferences have been selected for publication in this issue. These works contribute to the theoretical foundations of data science and explore mathematical models and methods for solving problems in applied fields. One of the most prominent ways in which statistical science has enriched data science is through the introduction of regularization methods, such as ridge regression and LASSO, which are used to handle ultra-high dimensional or multicollinear datasets. In the first paper of this special issue, the authors Y. Zhang, J. Thakar, D.J. Topham, A.R. Falsey, D. Zeng and X. Qiu construct two useful equivalence relationships for regularized regression â€“ one for efficiently fitting the concurrent functional regression model, and the second for efficiently solving weighted principal component regression. The development of ensemble learning methods has complemented traditional model selection and regularization approaches, giving experimenters and end-users a rich arsenal of powerful statistical learning methods. Spearheaded by techniques such as random forest, bagging, adaptive boosting, gradient boosting, and random subspace learning, ensemble learning methods have proven valuable in the study and analysis of increasingly larger and more complex data sets. In the second paper, M. Elshrif and E. FokouÃ© present a novel adaptation of the random subspace learning approach to regression analysis and classification of high-dimension, lowsample-size data.",2018,
Social and cultural aspects of AIDS at the Health Sciences Symposium in Bobo Dioulasso.,"The fourth annual conference of the ""Journees des Sciences de la Sante"" in Bobo Dioulasso on April 4-8 1995 discussed the research work being carried out in Burkina Faso and the surrounding countries: Mali Ivory Coast Niger and Togo. Seven papers were presented concerning the psychological social and cultural aspects of AIDS. In particular the papers discussed issues concerning 1) the interventions initiated by the Centres for Recovery and Nutritional Education to fight the AIDS epidemic; 2) the need for counseling provided with HIV screening; 3) an AIDS prevention training program targeting Burkinabe truck drivers; 4) evaluation of an AIDS information and education program for Burkina Faso truck drivers; 5) the impact of discrimination against AIDS sufferers on the fight against AIDS; 6) a communication strategy for AIDS-affected migrants; and 7) the relationship between breastfeeding and HIV transmission.",1995,
"Genomes of â€œSpiribacterâ€, a streamlined, successful halophilic bacterium","BackgroundThalassosaline waters produced by the concentration of seawater are widespread and common extreme aquatic habitats. Their salinity varies from that of sea water (ca. 3.5%) to saturation for NaCl (ca. 37%). Obviously the microbiota varies dramatically throughout this range. Recent metagenomic analysis of intermediate salinity waters (19%) indicated the presence of an abundant and yet undescribed gamma-proteobacterium. Two strains belonging to this group have been isolated from saltern ponds of intermediate salinity in two Spanish salterns and were named â€œSpiribacterâ€.ResultsThe genomes of two isolates of â€œSpiribacterâ€ have been fully sequenced and assembled. The analysis of metagenomic datasets indicates that microbes of this genus are widespread worldwide in medium salinity habitats representing the first ecologically defined moderate halophile. The genomes indicate that the two isolates belong to different species within the same genus. Both genomes are streamlined with high coding densities, have few regulatory mechanisms and no motility or chemotactic behavior. Metabolically they are heterotrophs with a subgroup II xanthorhodopsin as an additional energy source when light is available.ConclusionsThis is the first bacterium that has been proven by culture independent approaches to be prevalent in hypersaline habitats of intermediate salinity (half a way between the sea and NaCl saturation). Predictions from the proteome and analysis of transporter genes, together with a complete ectoine biosynthesis gene cluster are consistent with these microbes having the salt-out-organic-compatible solutes type of osmoregulation. All these features are also consistent with a well-adapted fully planktonic microbe while other halophiles with more complex genomes such as Salinibacter ruber might have particle associated microniches.",2013,BMC Genomics
Late Roman D. A matter of open(ing) or closed horizons,"* Sagalassos Archaeological Research Project, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Blijde Inkomststraat 21/3314, 3000 Leuven, Belgium In this paper we argue for reconsidering and grouping regional late Roman table ware typologies in the study region of southern Anatolia and Cyprus. Under the common denominator of Late Roman D (LRD), it is proposed to group product lines such as Cypriot red slip ware (CRSW), Sagalassos red slip ware (SRSW) and other recently discovered lines of table ware production in southern Asia Minor. The argumentation builds on published evidence concerning fabric classification, archaeometrical research on clay raw materials and typological comparisons. A broader typological taxonomy is proposed that could lead to important lines of research with respect to the interpretation of regional typologies within their ancient contexts.",2011,
Order selection for possibly infinite-order non-stationary time series,"Most model selection methods for time series models with many predictors are devised for the stationary processes. We consider the problem of selecting higher-order autoregressive (AR) models whose integration orders can be positive or zero, and hence both stationary and non-stationary cases are included. Combining the strengths of AIC and BIC, we propose a two-stage information criterion (TSIC), and show that TSIC is asymptotically efficient in predicting integrated AR models when the underlying AR coefficients satisfy a wide range of conditions. We also conduct a simulation study to compare the performance of AIC, HQIC, BIC, TSIC, Lasso, the adaptive Lasso and the bridge criterion. Our study reveals that TSIC performs favorably compared to other methods in various scenarios.",2019,AStA Advances in Statistical Analysis
A new nothrotheriid xenarthran from the early Pliocene of Pomataâ€Ayte (Bolivia): new insights into the caniniformâ€“molariform transition in sloths,"Tardigrade xenarthrans are today represented only by the two tree sloth genera Bradypus and Choloepus, which inhabit the Neotropical rainforests and are characterized by their slowness and suspensory locomotion. Sloths have been recognized in South America since the early Oligocene. This monophyletic group is represented by five clades traditionally recognized as families: Bradypodidae, Megalonychidae, Mylodontidae (â€ ), Megatheriidae (â€ ) and Nothrotheriidae (â€ ). A new nothrotheriid ground sloth represented by a dentary and several postcranial elements, Aymaratherium jeani gen. nov., sp. nov., from the early Pliocene locality of Pomata-Ayte (Bolivia) is reported. This small- to medium-sized species is characterized especially by its dentition and several postcranial features. It exhibits several convergences with the â€˜aquaticâ€™ nothrotheriid sloth Thalassocnus and the giant megatheriid ground sloth Megatherium (M.)Â americanum, and is interpreted as a selective feeder, with good pronation and supination movements. The tricuspid caniniform teeth of Aymaratherium may represent a transitional stage between the caniniform anterior teeth of basal megatherioids and basal nothrotheriids (1/1C-4/3M as in Hapalops or Mionothropus) and the molariform anterior teeth of megatheriids (5/4M, e.g. Megatherium). To highlight the phylogenetic position of this new taxon among nothrotheriid sloths, we performed a cladistic assessment of the available dental and postcranial evidence. Our results, derived from a TNT treatment of a data matrix largely based on a published phylogenetic data set, indicate that Aymaratherium is either sister taxon to Mionothropus or sister to the clade Nothrotheriini within Nothrotheriinae. They further support the monophyly of both the Nothrotheriinae and the Nothrotheriini, as suggested previously by several authors.",2016,Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society
The Behavioral and Developmental Consequences of Corpus Callosal Agenesis and Aicardi Syndrome,"From the standpoint of developmental psychiatry, studies of the behavioral consequences of agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC) have to date fallen broadly into two types. First of all, most â€œbehavioralâ€ studies of ACC are accounts of research carried out in controlled laboratory settings, and these include studies involving motor tasks and measures of interhemispheric transfer time, and work in the area of psycholinguistics. These studies, which have been reviewed extensively elsewhere (e.g. Milner and Jeeves, 1979; Lassonde, 1986; Ramaekers, 1991) and must surely be the most informative body of research in the investigation of the psychological concomitants of callosal agenesis, are well represented in the present volume. Secondly, there is a body of research concerning the naturally-occurring behavioral problems of acallosal people (as distinct from behavioral observations from laboratory work). There are two notable examples of this work. Firstly, there is a long history of clinical reporting and research into the purported association between ACC and major mental illness, particularly schizophrenia (Gulman et al., 1982; Hatta et al., 1984). The findings in this area of research are at best inconclusive: it is as yet unclear whether the occurrence of schizophrenia in acallosal individuals is related to the callosal lesion, or to other factors (David, 1989; Njiokiktjien, 1991). The ongoing work into Andermannâ€™s Syndrome (Andermann et al., 1972), where periods of hallucinatory experience â€” particularly early in adult life â€” are reported to occur, may shed further light on the specificity of this association. Secondly, in learning-disabled acallosal children, a high frequency of behavior disturbance has been reported, but as yet neither the nature of such behavioral problems nor the extent to which they are related to callosal dysgenesis has been clarified (Roeltgen and Roeltgen, 1989; Njiokiktjien and Ramaekers, 1991).",1994,
Management des infizierten Implantats im Gesichts-/SchÃ¤delbereich,"Durch die Moglichkeit der Implantation von Fremdmaterial wurden die medizinischen Therapiemoglichkeiten auch im Gesichtsschadelbereich zum Vorteil des Patienten substanziell erweitert. Neben den offensichtlichen Vorteilen der fehlenden Entnahmemorbiditat und unbegrenzten Verfugbarkeit ist auf der anderen Seite als haufigste Komplikation die fremdmaterialassoziierte Infektion zu nennen. Der Gesichtsschadelbereich ist durch seine verbesserte Gewebeperfusion gegenuber anderen anatomischen Arealen privilegiert, daraus ergeben sich Auswirkungen auf den Verlauf und somit auch auf das Management von Infektionen in diesem Bereich. Dieser Artikel soll eine Ubersicht uber die Therapiemoglichkeiten von fremdmaterialassoziierten Infektionen sowohl dentaler Implantate, Osteosynthesematerial als auch im Rahmen der Kranioplastik liefern.",2017,Op-journal
Rolle des Hausarztes bei der Erkennung der Alkoholkrankheit und alkoholassoziierter OrganschÃ¤den,"Chronischer Alkoholkonsum unterschiedlichen Ausmases kann alle Lebensbereiche infiltrieren und zu zahlreichen korperlichen, seelischen und sozialen Schaden fuhren. Es ist daher sehr wichtig in der Klinik und Praxis, an alkoholassoziierte Erkrankungen zu denken und sie zu thematisieren. Es gibt kaum ein Organ, welches nicht infolge eines Alkoholmissbrauchs geschadigt werden kann (s. Tabelle 8-1). Bis zu 75% der Alkoholiker, die zur stationaren Entwohnungsbehandlung kommen, leiden an Alkoholfolgekrankheiten. Bei 29 % von Mannern und 9 % von Frauen, die in ein Allgemeinkrankenhaus eingewiesen wurden, lag eine alkoholassoziierte Erkrankung vor: Delirium tremens (13%), Krampfanfalle (11,4%), Kopfverletzungen (9%) und Leberzirrhose (8%). Bei Alkoholmissbrauchern kommen haufiger Verletzungen vor (Frakturen wie z.B. Knochel- und Rippenfrakturen).",2002,
A risk signature with four autophagyâ€related genes for predicting survival of glioblastoma multiforme,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a devastating brain tumour without effective treatment. Recent studies have shown that autophagy is a promising therapeutic strategy for GBM. Therefore, it is necessary to identify novel biomarkers associated with autophagy in GBM. In this study, we downloaded autophagy-related genes from Human Autophagy Database (HADb) and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) website. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and multivariate Cox regression analysis were performed to identify genes for constructing a risk signature. A nomogram was developed by integrating the risk signature with clinicopathological factors. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and calibration plot were used to evaluate the efficiency of the prognostic model. Finally, four autophagy-related genes (DIRAS3, LGALS8, MAPK8 and STAM) were identified and were used for constructing a risk signature, which proved to be an independent risk factor for GBM patients. Furthermore, a nomogram was developed based on the risk signature and clinicopathological factors (IDH1 status, age and history of radiotherapy or chemotherapy). ROC curve and calibration plot suggested the nomogram could accurately predict 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rate of GBM patients. For function analysis, the risk signature was associated with apoptosis, necrosis, immunity, inflammation response and MAPK signalling pathway. In conclusion, the risk signature with 4 autophagy-related genes could serve as an independent prognostic factor for GBM patients. Moreover, we developed a nomogram based on the risk signature and clinical traits which was validated to perform better for predicting 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rate of GBM.",2020,Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine
Robust Bayesian Lasso Regression,"Choosing the best subset is one of the key issues in formulating regression models. The purpose of these methods is to determine the predictor variables and to distinguish them from tolerable predictor variables so that the accuracy of the estimates and hence the accuracy of the future observations increases. When the number of the variables of the regression model is more than the number of the observations, or if there is a linear correlation between the predictors, choosing a variable with frequentist methods is usually inefficient and therefore the importance of Bayesian methods becomes more obvious. Among these methods, the Bayesian Lasso regression method is an appropriate choice, because by using this method we can compute the uncertainty level in any chosen model, however it is not the case in standard Lasso. Considering the fact that this method is sensitive to outliers, the convergence of the parameter estimation algorithm will decrease, therefore, it is better to use the robust methods. In this article, the Robust Bayesian Lasso regression is presented and its priority over the Bayesian Lasso regression will be mentioned.",2016,Journal of Fundamental and Applied Sciences
` 1-Penalised Ordinal Polytomous Regression Estimators with Application to Gene Expression Studies,"Qualitative but ordered random variables, such as severity of a pathology, are of paramount importance in biostatistics and medicine. Understanding the conditional distribution of such qualitative variables as a function of other explanatory variables can be performed using a specific regression model known as ordinal polytomous regression. Variable selection in the ordinal polytomous regression model is a computationally difficult combinatorial optimisation problem which is however crucial when practitioners need to understand which covariates are physically related to the output and which covariates are not. One easy way to circumvent the computational hardness of variable selection is to introduce a penalised maximum likelihood estimator based on some well chosen non-smooth penalisation function such as, e.g., the `1-norm. In the case of the Gaussian linear model, the `1-penalised least-squares estimator, also known as LASSO estimator, has attracted a lot of attention in the last decade, both from the theoretical and algorithmic viewpoints. However, even in the Gaussian linear model, accurate calibration of the relaxation parameter, i.e., the relative weight of the penalisation term in the estimation cost function is still considered a difficult problem that has to be addressed with caution. In the present paper, we apply `1-penalisation to the ordinal polytomous regression model and compare several hyper-parameter calibration strategies. Our main contributions are: (a) a useful and simple `1 penalised estimator for ordinal polytomous regression and a thorough description of how to apply Nesterovâ€™s accelerated gradient and the online Frank-Wolfe methods to the problem of computing this estimator, (b) a new hyper-parameter calibration method for the proposed model, based on the QUT idea of Giacobino et al. and (c) a code which can be freely used that implements the proposed estimation procedure. 2012 ACM Subject Classification Mathematics of computing â†’ Regression analysis",2018,
The Glycome of Normal and Malignant Plasma Cells,"The glycome, i.e. the cellular repertoire of glycan structures, contributes to important functions such as adhesion and intercellular communication. Enzymes regulating cellular glycosylation processes are related to the pathogenesis of cancer including multiple myeloma. Here we analyze the transcriptional differences in the glycome of normal (n = 10) and two cohorts of 332 and 345 malignant plasma-cell samples, association with known multiple myeloma subentities as defined by presence of chromosomal aberrations, potential therapeutic targets, and its prognostic impact. We found i) malignant vs. normal plasma cells to show a characteristic glycome-signature. They can ii) be delineated by a lasso-based predictor from normal plasma cells based on this signature. iii) Cytogenetic aberrations lead to distinct glycan-gene expression patterns for t(11;14), t(4;14), hyperdiploidy, 1q21-gain and deletion of 13q14. iv) A 38-gene glycome-signature significantly delineates patients with adverse survival in two independent cohorts of 545 patients treated with high-dose melphalan and autologous stem cell transplantation. v) As single gene, expression of the phosphatidyl-inositol-glycan protein M as part of the targetable glycosyl-phosphatidyl-inositol-anchor-biosynthesis pathway is associated with adverse survival. The prognostically relevant glycome deviation in malignant cells invites novel strategies of therapy for multiple myeloma.",2013,PLoS ONE
Twin Boosting: improved feature selection and prediction,"We propose Twin Boosting which has much better feature selection behavior than boosting, particularly with respect to reducing the number of false positives (falsely selected features). In addition, for cases with a few important effective and many noise features, Twin Boosting also substantially improves the predictive accuracy of boosting. Twin Boosting is as general and generic as (gradient-based) boosting. It can be used with general weak learners and in a wide variety of situations, including generalized regression, classification or survival modeling. Furthermore, it is computationally feasible for large problems with potentially many more features than observed samples. Finally, for the special case of orthonormal linear models, we prove equivalence of Twin Boosting to the adaptive Lasso which provides some theoretical aspects on feature selection with Twin Boosting.",2010,Statistics and Computing
