Enormes incidentalomes surrÃ©naliens: rÃ´le de l'imagerie mÃ©dicale Ã  propos de deux cas,"La terminologie incidentalome derive etymologiquement de l'expression anglaise Â« incidental tumor Â». Il s'agit d'une masse tumorale de decouverte fortuite par imagerie medicale aussi appelee fortuitome. Les premieres tumeurs en cause etaient des tumeurs surrenaliennes decouvertes dans 4-10% des explorations dâ€²imagerie [1]. Ensuite d'autres tumeurs comme les tumeurs hypophysaires, pancreatiques, thyroidiennes, ovariennes, cardiaques et hepatiques ont ete decouvertes fortuitement. Finalement le concept a ete elargi a toute decouverte fortuite a l'occasion d'un examen realise en radiodiagnostic pour une autre affection [2â€“4]. La differenciation entre lesions benignes et malignes est importante pour la prise en charge [5]. Ceci est d'autant important dans les pays a ressources limitees ou le plateau technique est insuffisant. Cette situation est notee dans notre hopital ou il n'existe pas d'imagerie par resonance magnetique (IRM), d'imagerie nucleaire, de biologie de pointe et d'anatomopathologie. Nous decrivons deux cas dâ€™enormes masses surrenaliennes rarement observees dans la litterature. Elles ont ete explorees au CHU Souro-Sanou de Bobo-Dioulasso a l'aide d'un echographe standard et d'un scanner multicoupe de 6 barrettes avec un protocole en quatre phases dont la phase tardive etait retardee de 10 minutes (mn). Nous discuterons des approches diagnostiques de l'imagerie au scanner.",2012,The Pan African Medical Journal
Variables selection by the LASSO method. Application to malaria data of Tori-Bossito (Benin),"This work deals with prediction of anopheles number using environmental and climate variables. The variables selection is performed 
by GLMM (Generalized linear mixed model) combined with the Lasso method and simple cross validation. Selected variables are debiased 
while the prediction 
is generated by simple GLMM. Finally, the results reveal to be qualitatively better, at selection, the prediction 
 point of view than those obtained by the reference method.",2016,
MeningiSSS: A New Predictive Score to Support Decision on Invasive Procedures to Monitor or Manage the Intracerebral Pressure in Children with Bacterial Meningitis,"Knowing the individual childâ€™s risk is highly useful when deciding on treatment strategies, especially when deciding on invasive procedures. In this study, we aimed to develop a new predictive score for children with bacterial meningitis and compare this with existing predictive scores and individual risk factors. We developed the Meningitis Swedish Survival Score (MeningiSSS) based on a previous systematic review of risk factors. From this, we selected risk factors identified in moderate-to-high-quality studies that could be assessed at admission to the hospital. Using data acquired from medical records of 101 children with bacterial meningitis, we tested the overall capabilities of the MeningiSSS compared with four existing predictive scores using a receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis to assert the area under the curve (AUC). Finally, we tested all predictive scores at their cut-off levels using a Chi-square test. As outcome, we used a small number of predefined outcomes; in-hospital mortality, 30-day mortality, occurrence of neurological disabilities at discharge defined as Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category Scale category two to five, any type of complications occurring during the hospital stay, use of intensive care, and use of invasive procedures to monitor or manage the intracerebral pressure. For identifying children later undergoing invasive procedures to monitor or manage the intracerebral pressure, the MeningiSSS excelled in the ROC-analysis (AUCâ€‰=â€‰0.90) and also was the only predictive score able to identify all cases at its cut-off level (25 vs 0%, pâ€‰<â€‰0.01). For intensive care, the MeningiSSS (AUCâ€‰=â€‰0.79) and the Simple Luanda Scale (AUCâ€‰=â€‰0.75) had the best results in the ROC-analysis, whereas others performed less well (AUCâ€‰â‰¤â€‰0.65). Finally, while none of the scoresâ€™ results were significantly associated with complications, an elevated score on the MeningiSSS (AUCâ€‰=â€‰0.70), Niklasson Scale (AUCâ€‰=â€‰0.72), and the Hersonâ€“Todd Scale (AUCâ€‰=â€‰0.79) was all associated with death. The MeningiSSS outperformed existing predictive scores at identifying children later having to undergo invasive procedures to monitor or manage the intracerebral pressure in children with bacterial meningitis. Our results need further external validation before use in clinical practice. Thus, the MeningiSSS could potentially be helpful when making difficult decisions concerning intracerebral pressure management.",2019,Neurocritical Care
The Measurement of Income Segregation,"We examine the problem of measuring the extent to which students with different income levels attend separate schools. Unless rich and poor attend the same schools in the same proportions, some segregation will exist. Since income is a continuous cardinal variable, however, the rich-poor dichotomy is necessarily arbitrary and renders any application of a binary segregation measure artificial. This paper provides an axiomatic characterization of a measure of income segregation that takes into account the cardinal nature of income. This measure satisfies an empirically useful decomposition by sub-districts. âˆ—We are indebted to David M. Frankel. This paper benefited greatly from his generous collaboration.

Asymptotics and Optimal Designs of SLOPE for Sparse Linear Regression,"In sparse linear regression, the SLOPE estimator generalizes LASSO by assigning magnitude-dependent regularizations to different coordinates of the estimate. In this paper, we present an asymptotically exact characterization of the performance of SLOPE in the high-dimensional regime where the number of unknown parameters grows in proportion to the number of observations. Our asymptotic characterization enables us to derive optimal regularization sequences to either minimize the MSE or to maximize the power in variable selection under any given level of Type-I error. In both cases, we show that the optimal design can be recast as certain infinite-dimensional convex optimization problems, which have efficient and accurate finite-dimensional approximations. Numerical simulations verify our asymptotic predictions. They also demonstrate the superiority of our optimal design over LASSO and a regularization sequence previously proposed in the literature.",2019,2019 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)
Overview of clinical perspectives and mechanisms of obesity.,"One only has to open the newspaper or turn on the radioto hear about the epidemic of obesity in America. Not onlydoes obesity exact a heavy toll on the populationâ€™s health,but the medical costs associated with obesity, especiallythose related to treatment for type II diabetes and cardio-vascular disease, are astronomical. The American MedicalAssociation now estimates that the expense to society oftreating obesity-associated diseases, particularly diabetes,now exceeds that of smoking-related diseases (Schwimmeret al., 2003). Even the aviation industry has recently in-creased its average per-passenger weight estimate by 10pounds, in order to maintain air safety in the face of theever-increasing waistline (Phillips, 2003).The existence of adipose tissue as a specialized organreï¬‚ects the needs developed by organisms over time tocope with irregular and unpredictable supplies of nutri-ents. These needs became especially acute in the omnivo-rous mammals and were probably a key survival feature.In",2005,"Birth defects research. Part A, Clinical and molecular teratology"
Post-selection adaptive inference for Least Angle Regression and the Lasso,"We propose inference tools for least angle regression and the lasso, from the joint distribution of suitably normalized spacings of the LARS algorithm. From this we extend the results of the asymptotic null distribution of the â€œcovariance testâ€ of Lockhart et al. (2013). But we go much further, deriving exact finite sample results for a new asymptotically equivalent procedure called the â€œspacing testâ€. This provides exact conditional tests at any step of the LAR algorithm as well as â€œselection intervalsâ€ for the appropriate true underlying regression parameter. Remarkably, these tests and intervals account correctly for the adaptive selection done by LARS.",2014,

3086 Virtual World-based Cardiac Rehabilitation to Promote Healthy Lifestyle Among Cardiac Patients,"charged without an operation or patients who had an operation, but nothing was found. The distribution of data samples for prediction task 2 is 37 operation not needed cases and 38 operation of benefit cases. An experienced surgical resident from UPMC manually segmented 3D PI ROIs from the CT scans (5 mm Axial cut) for each case. The most concerning ~10-15 cm segment of bowel for necrosis with a 1 cm margin was selected. A total of 7 slices per patient were segmented for consistency. For both prediction task 1 and prediction task 2, we independently completed the following procedure for testing and training: 1.) Extracted radiomic features from the 3D PI ROIs that resulted in 99 total features. 2.) Used LASSO feature selection to determine the subset of the original 99 features that are most significant for performance of the prediction task. 3.) Used leave-one-out cross-validation for testing and training to account for the small dataset size in our preliminary analysis. Implemented and trained several machine learning models (AdaBoost, SVM, and Naive Bayes). 4.) Evaluated the trained models in terms of AUC and Accuracy and determined the ideal model structure based on these performance metrics. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Prediction Task 1: The top-performing model for this task was an SVM model trained using 19 features. This model had an AUC of 0.79 and an accuracy of 75%. Prediction Task 2: The top-performing model for this task was an SVM model trained using 28 features. This model had an AUC of 0.74 and an accuracy of 64%. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to use radiomic-based machine learning models for the prediction of tissue ischemia, specifically intestinal ischemia in the setting of PI. In this preliminary study, which serves as a proof of concept, the performance of our models has demonstrated the potential of machine learning based only on radiomic imaging features to have discriminative power for surgical decision-making problems. While many non-imaging-related clinical factors play a role in the gestalt of clinical decision making when PI presents, we have presented radiomic-basedmodels that may augment this decision-making process, especially for more difficult cases when clinical features indicating acute abdomen are absent. It should be noted that prediction task 2, whether or not a patient presenting with PI would benefit from an operation, has lower performance than prediction task 1 and is also a more challenging task for physicians in real clinical environments. While our results are promising and demonstrate potential, we are currently working to increase our dataset to 300 patients to further train and assess our models.

Child mortality in towns and villages in the Sahel,In this paper [the authors] begin by defining a conceptual framework to study the health of children by place of residence. [They] then use data from Child Mortality Surveys in the Sahel (EMIS) conducted in the towns of Bamako [in Mali] and Bobo-Dioulasso [in Burkina Faso] and in a rural area in Senegal to ascertain whether cities remain advantaged in terms of health. Mortality is found to be higher among young rural children especially during the second year of life even when compared to that in underprivileged urban neighborhoods. However on the whole the estimated effects of individual and household characteristics on childrens survival are very similar in cities and in rural areas.

Student Data and Problem 1,"Student data consist of 40 students with six variables, which are the study hours per day (X1), spending money per month (X2), drinking days per week (X3), gender (X4), smoking (X5), and examination scores (X6). The amount of data is not large. We published four statistical books on SAS, SPSS, Statistica, and JMP using these data because the reader could easily understand the meaning of variables and data. Although we never believed the data would be helpful for our research, we discriminated the data after we completed analysis of the Iris, CPD, and random number data in 1999. When we discriminated these data using five variables with 70 points as the passing mark, we found a defect in IP-OLDF. Because four numerical variables are integer values and two variables are the binary integers 0/1, and there are many overlapping cases, the obtained vertex of convex polyhedron (CP) consists of over (p + 1) cases and the obtained solution is not true MNM. Although we recognized Problems 1 and 4 before 1980, we did not realize that Problem 1 causes a defect in IP-OLDF. By the scatter plot of two variables, as indicated in Table 1.1, we found that the reason for the defect in IP-OLDF is the result of Problem 1. However, we could not revise this problem until 2006, when Revised IP-OLDF solved Problem 1 completely. In 2004, IP-OLDF found that Swiss banknote data are LSD, and no LDFs, with the exception of Revised IP-OLDF and H-SVM, could discriminate LSD theoretically (Problem 2 ). In 2005, we were able to validate the discrimination of original data (the training sample) by 20,000 resampling samples (the validation sample). After 2006, we could compare six MP-based LDFs and two statistical LDFs. After 2009, we developed the 100-fold cross-validation for small sample method (the Method 1). The Method 1 solves Problem 4 , and the best model provides clear evaluation of eight LDFs. Although we could not explain the useful meaning of 95 % CI of the coefficient, we completed the basic research in 2010. After 2010, applied research started on LSD discrimination using the pass/fail determination that employs examination scores. We find Problem 3 that was solved in 2013. In 2015, the applied research was completed because we could successfully explain the useful meaning of 95 % CI of the coefficient, and the Theory Method 1 solved Problem 4 completely. In October 2015, a young researcher, Ishii, presented the challenging results of microarray datasets using principal component analysis (PCA). Because the researcher indicated six microarray datasets on HP (http://www.bioinf.ucd.ie/people/ian/), we developed the Matroska feature-selection method (Method 2) within 41 days. For more than ten years, many researchers have struggled to analyze microarray datasets because the datasets consist of few cases with huge genes (Problem 5 ). The Theory is most suitable for Problem 5 . Recently, many researchers have expected LASSO to solve Problem 5. Because Revised IP-OLDF selects features naturally, they should compare their results to ours through the Swiss banknote data, Japanese-automobile data, Student linearly separable data, and six microarray datasets. Such comparison should be helpful for LASSO research.",2016,

Uplink Channel Estimation for Bandlimited MC-DS-CDMA Systems Relying on Long Spreading Codes,"This paper considers pilot-based parameter estimation for bandlimited MC-DS-CDMA systems relying on long spreading codes. Three different schemes are proposed and compared. The two so-called unstructured algorithms, namely the Least Squares Estimator (LS-E) and the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator Estimator (LASSOE) first estimate the composite channel impulse response, and then extract the propagation delay, amplitude and phase. By contrast, the third algorithm namely the Structured LS Search Estimator (SLSS-E) exploits the a priori knowledge of the chip waveform and directly estimates the channel parameters. Parallel interference cancelation (PIC) is incorporated in the SLSS-E for the sake of mitigating the effect of multiple access interference and hence to further improve the performance. The complexity of PIC assisted SLSS-E and LS-E only increases linearly with the number of users, with the number of subcarriers and with the length of the pilot sequence. Simulation results indicate that the PIC assisted structured estimator outperforms its unstructured counterparts.",2011,2011 IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Fall)
A Model for Professional Development in Elementary Science,"Statements of outcomes for 21 st century learners typically include inquiry-based learning as a major goal. In the PRISM Project, 62 elementary teachers in Montana were selected to receive professional development using inquiry science instruction in their classrooms. Participants attended workshops designed to model inquiry lessons, participated in online discussions to help them make their lessons more inquiry-based, and prepared Scoop notebooks containing three lessons demonstrating how they were implementing inquiry in their classrooms. Based on analysis of these data, participants were judged to have met the goal of the project to increase their use of inquiry in the science classroom. In recent years much has been written on the need for bringing education into the twentyfirst century. Educational reformers such as Ken Kay, president of the Partnership for 21 st Century Skills, claim that students need a curriculum that reflects an emphasis on twenty-first century skills such as higher order thinking skills, relationship building, and the use of technology, in particular. These items have been a significant part of educational discussion for many years, but there is now substantial discussion on changing the culture of schools from testdriven reception learning to one of more autonomous student learning. For this to happen, teachers must be equipped to respond to this change. At present, teacher education programs may have such change as a goal, but the emerging emphasis in these programs is for greater attention to clinical experiences to prepare teacher candidates more effectively for the workplace (NCATE, 2010). Emerging changes in teacher education appear to be focusing on making teachers more ready to enter existing classrooms rather than preparing them for twenty-first century classrooms. Therefore, if school cultures are to be changed, it means that current teachers who have mastered school routine need to be equipped to change their view of how students can learn most effectively. One area in which such change is needed is in the teaching of elementary science. If we examine the typical science textbook of the last 20 years we observe that the memorization of a body of science information is emphasized. Science education reformers of the twentieth century such as Joseph Schwab (1962) and Robert Karplus (1967) believed that the appropriate way for students to learn science was through active engagement in the process of inquiry, building on prior knowledge. Their thinking underpinned the science education reforms of that period. Why has classroom teaching of science not reflected these changes? One reason is that changing the culture of the classroom is a very slow process. While substantial resources have been devoted to professional development for teachers over the decades, little change has been observed. Changes of the type proposed by Karplus and Schwab are endorsed by the science education professional community. The National Academy of Sciences (National Research Council 1996, 2000) is clear that science in the elementary school means pursuing the goals of studying science: that students are to function as young scientists. This position is endorsed by Bell, Smetana, and Binns (2005) who point out that most students need substantial scaffolding before they are ready to develop scientific questions and design effective data collection. They 1 Davison et al.: A Model for Professional Development in Elementary Science Published by PDXScholar, 2011 118 NORTHWEST PASSAGE, 9(2) indicate that the inquiry scale should be seen as a continuum, whereby students would progress gradually from lower to higher levels during a year. Unfortunately, this need for scaffolding is also evidenced by many elementary school science teachers, especially those who teach in small rural schools. It is essential, therefore, to provide these teachers with professional development opportunities to help them move across the inquiry continuum. To accomplish this change, teachers will need to change the culture of their classrooms from one of reception learning to one of active learner engagement. The substantial body of literature on inquiry science indicates that the science education community has been focused on this issue. It is also clear that many elementary science teachers would like to incorporate inquiry instruction into their teaching but lack the means to do it effectively. The purpose of this investigation was to explore methods whereby elementary teachers can become more effective in providing a climate of inquiry science for their students. Literature Review: Inquiry-based Instruction In a synthesis of teaching science though inquiry, Haury (1993) recognizes the differing conceptions of inquiry presented by science educators, but we suggest that many of these differences can be addressed by adherence to the inquiry continuum. While advocacy for inquiry-based instruction is generally conceptual in its support, researchers look for evidence that students learn more science when inquiry methods are used. Mattheis and Nakayama (1988) found that inquiry-based programs in the middle grades enhanced student performance, especially with regard to laboratory skills and graphing and data interpretation skills. Glasson (1989) found students scored higher on tests of procedural knowledge, while Lloyd and Contreras (1985) found increases in vocabulary knowledge and conceptual understanding. However, these are isolated studies and broad generalizations should not be made. Cobern, Schuster, Adams, Applegate, Skjold, Undreiu, Loving, and Gobert (2010) undertook a carefully controlled experimental study comparing the efficacy of carefully designed inquiry instruction and equally carefully designed direct instruction in realistic science classroom situations at the middle school grades. They found that inquiry and direct methods led to comparable science conceptual understanding in equal instructional times. Given that many of the intended benefits of inquiry instruction are not reflected in such tests, they argued that the expected benefits of direct instruction were not evident. Thus they support well-designed, active engagement lessons which are well taught. On the other hand, Minner, Levy, and Century (2010) synthesized research on inquirybased science instruction over an 18 year period and concluded that the evidence of effects of inquiry-based instruction was not overwhelmingly positive. They did find that hands-on experiences with scientific or natural phenomena were found to be associated with increased conceptual learning. However, they did not find that high levels of inquiry were associated with more positive learning outcomes for students. While these findings offer only mild support for the use of inquiry-based methods in the science classroom, it can be argued that typical assessment methods place inquiry methods at a disadvantage. Therefore, we can argue that in the spirit of the National Science Education Standards (NRC, 1996, 2000) teachers should continue to be encouraged to use inquiry methods, where appropriate, in their classroom instruction in science. 2 Northwest Journal of Teacher Education, Vol. 9, Iss. 2 [2011], Art. 10 https://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/nwjte/vol9/iss2/10 DOI: 10.15760/nwjte.2012.9.2.10 FALL 2011 119 The PRISM Project The Partnership to Reform Inquiry Science in Montana (PRISM) was designed to prepare rural elementary teachers to improve student science achievement in Montana schools. It is a research-based state Math and Science Partnership project sponsored through the Montana Office of Public Instruction. For three years this project worked with 52 teachers in a large region in the southeast portion of Montana. The specific partner Local Education Associations were chosen based upon high need, availability and project guidelines. No school chosen was under 30% free and reduced lunch, a common indicator of schools of low SES status. The professional development focused on increasing the science subject matter knowledge of teachers, increasing teacher understanding and use of effective, research-based instructional strategies (specifically, inquiry-based instruction), and increasing teacher competency in the use of educational technology. Accomplishing the Goals of the PRISM Project A variety of activities were used to accomplish the project goals. The National Science Teachersâ€˜ Association (NSTA) SciPacks were selected to measure teachersâ€˜ knowledge of content appropriate to elementary school science. Not only do these SciPacks present content that elementary teachers should master, but the presentation of the content is interactive and supports an inquiry approach to science instruction. Over the course of the project, participants completed six SciPacks. Teachers were encouraged to adapt SciPack lessons in their own teaching. An emphasis on inquiry instruction was a priority of this project. The Inquiry Continuum (see categories in Tables 2 and 3) served as the standard against which progress towards the goals of inquiry would be measured. Workshop sessions focused attention on the modeling of inquiry lessons. These lessons were led primarily by science educators, but some participants also shared successes from their classrooms. In online discussions, participants addressed strategies they were using to make their instruction more inquiry based, including the adapting of regular text-based science lessons to a more inquiry focus. The primary evidence for the teachersâ€˜ use of inquiry was supplied by the use of Scoop notebooks (Borko, Stecher, & Kuffner, 2007). Teachers were asked to compile a notebook of evidences from their classroom over a period of three months during their second year in the project. These classroom samples were self-assessed for the level of inquiry reached and were also assessed by a project evaluator. Findings from the Project Use of inquiry in the clas",2011,
A* Lasso for Learning a Sparse Bayesian Network Structure for Continuous Variables,"We address the problem of learning a sparse Bayesian network structure for continuous variables in a high-dimensional space. The constraint that the estimated Bayesian network structure must be a directed acyclic graph (DAG) makes the problem challenging because of the huge search space of network structures. Most previous methods were based on a two-stage approach that prunes the search space in the first stage and then searches for a network structure satisfying the DAG constraint in the second stage. Although this approach is effective in a low-dimensional setting, it is difficult to ensure that the correct network structure is not pruned in the first stage in a high-dimensional setting. In this paper, we propose a single-stage method, called A* lasso, that recovers the optimal sparse Bayesian network structure by solving a single optimization problem with A* search algorithm that uses lasso in its scoring system. Our approach substantially improves the computational efficiency of the well-known exact methods based on dynamic programming. We also present a heuristic scheme that further improves the efficiency of A* lasso without significantly compromising the quality of solutions. We demonstrate our approach on data simulated from benchmark Bayesian networks and real data.",2013,

DL-PDE: Deep-learning based data-driven discovery of partial differential equations from discrete and noisy data,"In recent years, data-driven methods have been utilized to learn dynamical systems and partial differential equations (PDE). However, major challenges remain to be resolved, including learning PDE under noisy data and limited discrete data. To overcome these challenges, in this work, a deep-learning based data-driven method, called DL-PDE, is developed to discover the governing PDEs of underlying physical processes. The DL-PDE method combines deep learning via neural networks and data-driven discovery of PDEs via sparse regressions, such as the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) and sequential threshold ridge regression (STRidge). In this method, derivatives are calculated by automatic differentiation from the deep neural network, and equation form and coefficients are obtained with sparse regressions. The DL-PDE is tested with physical processes, governed by groundwater flow equation, contaminant transport equation, Burgers equation and Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation, for proof-of-concept and applications in real-world engineering settings. The proposed DL-PDE achieves satisfactory results when data are discrete and noisy.",2019,ArXiv

High-dimensional Linear Regression for Dependent Data with Applications to Nowcasting,"In recent years, extensive research has focused on the `1 penalized least squares (Lasso) estimators of high-dimensional linear regression when the number of covariates p is considerably larger than the sample size n. However, there is limited attention paid to the properties of the estimators when the errors and/or the covariates are serially dependent. In this paper, we investigate the theoretical properties of the Lasso estimators for linear regression with random design and weak sparsity under serially dependent and/or non-sub-Gaussian errors and covariates. In contrast to the traditional case in which the errors are i.i.d and have finite exponential moments, we show that p can be at most a power of n if the errors have only finite polynomial moments. In addition, the rate of convergence becomes slower due to the serial dependence in errors and the covariates. We also consider sign consistency for model selection via Lasso when there are serial correlations in the errors or the covariates or both. Adopting the framework of functional dependence measure, we provide a detailed description on 1 Statistica Sinica: Newly accepted Paper (accepted author-version subject to English editing)",2020,Statistica Sinica
Recovery of Muscle Strength after Microdiscectomy for Lumbar Disk Herniation: A Prospective Cohort Study with 1-Year Follow-Up,"Introduction It has not been shown that surgery is better than nonsurgical management for treating limb paresis caused by lumbar disk herniation.1â€“3 However in clinical practice, limb paresis is a frequent additional symptom to pain4â€“6, and for the patients, a major concern remains: â€œWhat are the chances that my muscle strength will recover after surgery?â€. The aim of this study is to give an answer to this question. We also wanted to investigate if persisting paresis is associated with worse outcome measured by changes in physical function, health related quality of life (HRQL), pain, and working capability. Materials and Methods In this prospective cohort study, we evaluated 403 consecutive patients operated with microdiscectomy for lumbar disk herniation. Of these patients, 91 (23%) had limb paresis and were included. All patients were operated at the Department of Neurosurgery, University Hospital of North Norway. Data were collected in a comprehensive clinical spine surgery registry for quality control and research between 1st of January 2004 and 30th of September 2006. Follow-up time from date of operation (baseline) was 1 year. The primary outcome measure was muscle strength of the affected limb. We used Daniels and Worthingham's techniques of manual muscle testing,7 which was graded to range from 0 to 5. Based on this scale we categorized the patients into three groups: severe paresis (grade 0â€“3), mild paresis (grade 4), and normal muscle strength (grade 5). Changes in motor function were classified as recovery (normal muscle strength) or nonrecovery (incompletely improved, unchanged or worse). Secondary outcome measures were HRQL (EQ-5D), Oswestry disability index (ODI), visual analogue scale (VAS) for leg pain and back pain, EQ-5D for general health state, and employment status. Results At 12 months 68 patients (75%) were fully recovered. Out of 23 patients (25%) who were not fully recovered, 9 (10%) were improved and 14 (15%) were unchanged. None got worse. Out of 29, 16 (55%) patients with severe paresis fully recovered whereas 52 (84%) out of 62 patients with mild paresis fully recovered (pâ€‰=â€‰0.003). A severe paresis at baseline was the only independent risk factor we could find for not having full recovery of muscle function, odds ratio: 4.2 (95% CI, 1.6â€“11.4). Duration of the paresis was not associated with recovery. The mean (SD) duration of paresis was 30 (57) days. For the whole study population, there was a statistically significant improvement of pain, functional status, HRQL, and general health (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). Patients who recovered had a significant better outcome than patients with persistent paresis, except for leg pain. Amongst those who did not recover, three times as many received workers compensation at 12 months follow up (57% vs. 20%, pâ€‰=â€‰0.001). Conclusion In general, patients have a 75% chance of recovery from a limb paresis after surgical treatment for lumbar disk herniation. Patients with mild paresis can have a good chance to recover (84%). Patients with severe paresis have less good chance to recover (55%). Persisting paresis seems to have a significant negative impact on the physical function and HRQL. There was no association between the preoperative duration of the muscle weakness and recovery.

INFECTION DU PLACENTA PAR LES PLAS&.fODIUM EN ZONE D'ENDgMIE,"Placental infections by Plasmodium in an endemic area. The risk factors. Summary: A survey has been carried out during eight months in the hospital of Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina Faso) in view to observe the infection of the placentas by Plasmodium and their risk factors. One thousand forty pregnant women were included. Infection rates. were 6.5 % during the low transmission season and 24.5 % during the high transmission season. P. falciparum was present in all rhe infections. Thirty eight per cent of the women under 18 years old and 26 % of the primigravidae were infected. The mean difference in birth weights between the newborn babies of primigravidae with infected or non-infected placentas was 275 g. The regular visits to antenatal clinics, a high level of education and suffisant income were linked with a low level of placental infection. The use of bed nets was linked with a low level of placental infections even after suppression of the other socio-economic data. These observations are discussed in view of an action against malaria in endemic areas.",1994,
Improved CBR for Endpoint Carbon Content Prediction of BOF Steelmaking,"Traditional basic oxygen furnace (BOF) prediction is usually dependent on experts and experiences which will result in deviation. Aiming at increasing the accuracy of endpoint carbon content prediction in BOF steelmaking, this paper proposes a data driven way called case-based reasoning (CBR) method to predict the endpoint carbon content of BOF steelmaking. In CBR, case representation is the basic, the selected attributes in case representation play an important role but dependent on expert experiences so that this paper uses lasso regression algorithm to get the attributes. Case retrieval makes a significant impact on reasoning result. Therefore, we apply affinity propagation (AP) clustering algorithm and water-filling algorithm to enhance the case retrieval so as to improve the accuracy and stability of endpoint carbon content prediction. Through the simulation experiment, the results show that the improved CBR can obviously improve the accuracy of endpoint carbon content prediction.",2018,2018 Ninth International Conference on Intelligent Control and Information Processing (ICICIP)
"[Characteristics of parent-adolescent communication about sexuality and HIV in Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso].","Adolescent females are a key target audience in the fight against sexually transmitted infections and HIV in sub-Saharan Africa. One issue is that families in Africa play a very limited role in sex education. The objective of this study was to examine parent-child communication from a qualitative perspective by exploring the characteristics and quality of parent-child communication. A cross-sectional study was conducted between April and September 2009 in Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina Faso). The study included 40 parent-child pairs (50% of in-school children and 50% of out-of-school children). Individual interviews and focus groups were conducted. The data were analyzed using Stata version 9.1 (quantitative data) and QSR Nvivo 2.0 (qualitative data). The study found that 74% (14/19) of out-of-school children communicated with their parents, compared to just 45% of in-school children (p = 0.07). Mother-child communication was found to be the most common type of parent-child communication, with 59% (13/22) of families who communicated about sexuality and HIV preferring mother-child communication. Further research is needed to identify the factors determining better communication among out-of-school children.",2012,Sante publique
Efficient and accurate methods for updating generalized linear models with multiple feature additions,"In this paper, we propose an approach for learning regression models efficiently in an environment where multiple features and data-points are added incrementally in a multistep process. At each step, any finite number of features maybe added and hence, the setting is not amenable to low rank updates. We show that our approach is not only efficient and optimal for ordinary least squares, weighted least squares, generalized least squares and ridge regression, but also more generally for generalized linear models and lasso regression that use iterated re-weighted least squares for maximum likelihood estimation. Our approach instantiated to linear settings has close relations to the partitioned matrix inversion mechanism based on Schur's complement. For arbitrary regression methods, even a relaxation of the approach is no worse than using the model from the previous step or using a model that learns on the additional features and optimizes the residual of the model at the previous step. Such problems are commonplace in complex manufacturing operations consisting of hundreds of steps, where multiple measurements are taken at each step to monitor the quality of the final product. Accurately predicting if the finished product will meet specifications at each or, at least, important intermediate steps can be extremely useful in enhancing productivity. We further validate our claims through experiments on synthetic and real industrial data sets.",2014,J. Mach. Learn. Res.

The first pattern excretes bilirubin (most conjugate) predominantly, the other excretes mostly biliverdin with some bilirubin. However, during starvation, the excretion of conjugate bilirubin gradually shifted to unconjugated biliverdin. The rate of shifting varies with species. 4. 4. Introduction of bilirubin into Anguilla japonica produced an initial excretion of mono-conjugates, followed by di-conjugates. Introduction of biliverdin caused an increased in the excretion of unconjugated biliverdin, but no significant increase of bilirubin in the bile was detected. 5. 5. A binary excretion pathway of bile pigments in fish is proposed. The evolutionary characteristics of heme catabolism in terrestrial animals with respect to this pathway is discussed.",1987,Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology B
Herodotus and Samos: Personal or Political?,"This article addresses the reasons behind Herodotus' interest in the island of Samos. Taking as its starting point the famous passage about Samian erga (3.60), I examine Herodotus' stated and implicit reasons for his extended Samian logoi . Scholars tend to explain his interest in Samos as lying in details of his biography. I argue that any such biographical connection to the island merely reinforces stronger unstated reasons for going on long about Samos: these have to do with Periclean Athens' competition with Polycratean Samos as a historical antecedent for thalassocracy, and-not unrelated-the Samian revolt.",2009,Classical World

Identification of genes in lipid metabolism associated with white matter features in preterm infants,"Abstract Background We have previously identified an association between lipids and features of diffusion tensor imaging in preterm infants, highlighting the KEGG peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor pathway (PPAR) as the most highly ranked in association with a white matter phenotype. Here we applied a penalised linear regression modelâ€”the graph-guided group lasso (GGGL)â€”to select single nucleotide polymorphisms within functionally related genes associated with the imaging trait. The GGGL model utilises network-based prior knowledge to improve the selection of variables of interest. Methods Images acquired with a 3T MR scanner were collected along with saliva for 72 preterm infants (mean gestational age 28 weeks [+4 days], mean postmenstrual age at scan 40 weeks [+3 days]). Salivary DNA was extracted and genotyped with HumanOmniExpress-12 arrays (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Fractional anisotropy maps were constructed from diffusion tensor imaging, and tract-based spatial statistics were used to obtain a group white matter skeleton varying with degree of prematurity, adjusting for age at scan. GGGL was applied to the genes in the PPAR pathway. Findings The GGGL method selected five of the 69 genes in the PPAR pathway, and these were functionally related in terms of Gene Ontology Biological Process and linearly correlated with white matter fractional anisotropy ( AQP7, ME1, PLIN1, SLC27A1 , and ACAA1 ). Analysis of transcriptional regulation with the PASTAA algorithm indicated that ACAA1, AQP7, ME1 , and SLC27A1 were jointly regulated by the EGR4 transcription factor (adjusted p=7Â·7Ã—10 âˆ’4 ). Interpretation Our GGGL analysis of genes in the PPAR pathway identified five highly ranked genes involved in neuronal growth, myelinogenesis, and nervous system response to inflammation, and jointly transcriptionally regulated. Since preterm infants are at increased risk of mental illness and cardiovascular morbidity in later life, this work uses an integrative data-driven strategy to propose a unifying mechanism for these systemic effects, suggesting a promising avenue for intervention.

Classification of Major Depressive Disorder via Multi-site Weighted LASSO Model,"Large-scale collaborative analysis of brain imaging data, in psychiatry and neurology, offers a new source of statistical power to discover features that boost accuracy in disease classification, differential diagnosis, and outcome prediction. However, due to data privacy regulations or limited accessibility to large datasets across the world, it is challenging to efficiently integrate distributed information. Here we propose a novel classification framework through multi-site weighted LASSO: each site performs an iterative weighted LASSO for feature selection separately. Within each iteration, the classification result and the selected features are collected to update the weighting parameters for each feature. This new weight is used to guide the LASSO process at the next iteration. Only the features that help to improve the classification accuracy are preserved. In tests on data from five sites (299 patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 258 normal controls), our method boosted classification accuracy for MDD by 4.9% on average. This result shows the potential of the proposed new strategy as an effective and practical collaborative platform for machine learning on large scale distributed imaging and biobank data.",2017,ArXiv
Information criteria for variable selection under sparsity,"The optimization of an information criterion in a variable selection procedure leads to an additional bias, which can be substantial for sparse, high-dimensional data. One can compensate for the bias by applying shrinkage while estimating within the selected models. This paper presents modified information criteria for use in variable selection and estimation without shrinkage. The analysis motivating the modified criteria follows two routes. The first, which we explore for signal-plus-noise observations only, proceeds by comparing estimators with and without shrinkage. The second, discussed for general regression models, describes the optimization or selection bias as a double-sided effect, which we call a mirror effect: among the numerous insignificant variables, those with large, noisy values appear more valuable than an arbitrary variable, while in fact they carry more noise than an arbitrary variable. The mirror effect is investigated for Akaikeâ€™s information criterion and for Mallowsâ€™ Cp, with special attention paid to the latter criterion as a stopping rule in a least-angle regression routine. The result is a new stopping rule, which focuses not on the quality of a lasso shrinkage selection but on the least-squares estimator without shrinkage within the same selection.",2014,Biometrika
A gene-expression-based signature predicts survival in adults with T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma: a multicenter study,"We aimed to establish a discriminative gene-expression-based classifier to predict survival outcomes of T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) patients. After exploring global gene-expression profiles of progressive (nâ€‰=â€‰22) vs. progression-free (nâ€‰=â€‰28) T-LBL patients, 43 differentially expressed mRNAs were identified. Then an eleven-gene-based classifier was established using LASSO Cox regression based on NanoString quantification. In the training cohort (nâ€‰=â€‰169), high-risk patients stratified using the classifier had significantly lower progression-free survival (PFS: hazards ratio 4.123, 95% CI 2.565â€“6.628; pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), disease-free survival (DFS: HR 3.148, 95% CI 1.857â€“5.339; pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), and overall survival (OS: HR 3.790, 95% CI 2.237â€“6.423; pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) compared with low-risk patients. The prognostic accuracy of the classifier was validated in the internal testing (nâ€‰=â€‰84) and independent validation cohorts (nâ€‰=â€‰360). A prognostic nomogram consisting of five independent variables including the classifier, lactate dehydrogenase levels, ECOG-PS, central nervous system involvement, and NOTCH1/FBXW7 status showed significantly greater prognostic accuracy than each single variable alone. The addition of a five-miRNA-based signature further enhanced the accuracy of this nomogram. Furthermore, patients with a nomogram score â‰¥154.2 significantly benefited from the BFM protocol. In conclusion, our nomogram comprising the 11-gene-based classifier may make contributions to individual prognosis prediction and treatment decision-making.",2020,Leukemia
LASSO and LSTM Integrated Temporal Model for Short-Term Solar Intensity Forecasting,"As a special form of the Internet of Things, smart grid is an Internet of both power and information, in which energy management is critical for making the best use of the power from renewable energy resources, such as solar and wind, while efficient energy management is hinged upon precise forecasting of power generation from renewable energy resources. In this paper, we propose a novel least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and long short term memory (LSTM) integrated forecasting model for precise short-term prediction of solar intensity based on meteorological data. It is a fusion of a basic time series model, data clustering, a statistical model, and machine learning. The proposed scheme first clusters data using ${k}$ -means++. For each cluster, a distinctive forecasting model is then constructed by applying LSTM, which learns the nonlinear relationships and LASSO, which captures the linear relationship within the data. Simulation results with open-source datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed model in short-term forecasting of solar intensity.",2019,IEEE Internet of Things Journal
Parsimonious additive models,"A new method for function estimation and variable selection, specifically designed for additive models fitted by cubic splines is proposed. This new method involves regularizing additive models using the l""1-norm, which generalizes the lasso to the nonparametric setting. As in the linear case, it shrinks coefficients and produces some coefficients that are exactly zero. It gives parsimonious models, selects significant variables, and reveals nonlinearities in the effects of predictors. Two strategies for finding a parsimonious additive model solution are proposed. Both algorithms are based on a fixed point algorithm, combined with a singular value decomposition that considerably reduces computation. The empirical behavior of parsimonious additive models is compared to the adaptive backfitting BRUTO algorithm. The results allow to characterize the domains in which our approach is effective: it performs significantly better than BRUTO when model estimation is challenging. An implementation of this method is illustrated using real data from the Cophar 1 ANRS 102 trial. Parsimonious additive models are applied to predict the indinavir plasma concentration in HIV patients. Results suggest that this new method is a promising technique for the research and application areas.",2007,Comput. Stat. Data Anal.
Bildungs- und Abbaumechanismen (oxy)chlorierter Aromaten in chlordotierten brennstoffreichen Benzol/Sauerstoff-Niederdruckflammen,"Die vorliegende Arbeit befast sich mit der Aufklarung der Bildungs- und Abbaumechanismen (oxy)chlorierter aromatischer Kohlenwasserstoffe unter homogenen Flammenbedingungen. Zu diesem Zweck werden chlordotierte, brennerstabilisierte, vorgemischte, flache, laminare, brennstoffreiche Benzol/Sauerstoff-Niederdruckflammen (C/O = 0.80, p = 27 mbar) hinsichtlich ihrer chemischen Zusammensetzung in Abhangigkeit vom Brennerabstand charakterisiert. Das Chlor wird dem Brenngas dieser Flammen entweder in Form eines chlorierten organischen Additivs (Chlorbenzol, Chlormethan, t-Butylchlorid, Chloroform) oder als elementares Chlor in Anteilen von maximal 10 Mol-% am Gesamtbrennstoff zugesetzt, entsprechend einem maximalen Cl/C- bzw. Cl/H-Verhaltnis von 0.02. Zur Probenahme werden die uber eine Quarzglassonde abgesaugten Flammengase in einer hohlkugelformigen Kuhlfalle bei p = 0.05 Pa und T = 77 K in einer festen Matrix des simultan zudosierten Radikalfangers Dimethyldisulfid (DMDS) kondensiert. Radikale aus der Flamme reagieren mit dem DMDS bereits in der festen Phase zu stabilen Methylthioverbindungen. Die nach dem Erwarmen der Kuhlfalle auf Zimmertemperatur erhaltene flussige Losung von stabilen Flammenprodukten und Abfangprodukten der Radikale in DMDS wird mittels GC/MS sowohl qualitativ als auch quantitativ analysiert. Durch systematische Probenahme bei verschiedenen Abstanden vom Brenner werden die Konzentrations/Brennerabstandsprofile der in der Flamme auftretenden (chlorierten) Kohlenwasserstoffe und Kohlenwasserstoffradikale aufgenommen. Mit dieser analytischen Methode sind die Flammenkonzentrationen von stabilen Kohlenwasserstoffen ab einer C-Atomzahl von vier bis funf, sowie von Kohlenwasserstoffradikalen ab zwei C-Atomen bzw. in chlorierter Form ab einem C-Atom bis hin zu polycyclischen aromatischen Kohlenwasserstoffen mit 24 C-Atomen bestimmbar (Nachweisgrenze: 0.1 ppm in der Flamme). - Der maximale Umsatz des uber das Brenngas in die Flamme eingebrachten Chlors in intermediar gebildete (oxy)chlorierte Aromaten bewegt sich je nach Additiv zwischen einem und drei Prozent. Es handelt sich dabei vorwiegend um monochlorierte Aromaten (Phenole, aliphatisch substituierte Benzole, Biphenyle und polycyclische Aromaten). Zweifach chlorierte Benzole konnen nur im Ausnahmefall und in sehr geringen Konzentrationen detektiert werden. Neben dem Chlorradikal konnen auch verschiedene chlorierte Kohlenwasserstoffradikale (Di- und Trichlormethyl, Chlorbutyl, Chlorphenyl) als Abbauprodukte der Additive uber ihre Abfangverbindungen identifiziert und quantifiziert werden. Die Bildungsmechanismen chlorierter Aromaten in den chlordotierten Benzolflammen sind eng mit den Abbaureaktionen des betreffenden Additivs verknupft. Neben der Analyse der Strukturen der in der jeweiligen Flamme gebildeten (oxy)chlorierten aromatischen Verbindungen sind vor allem auch die Konzentrations/Brennerabstandsprofile der chlorierten Spezies eine wichtige Diskussionsgrundlage fur die Aufklarung ihrer Entstehungsmechanismen. Durch die detaillierte Analyse der Profilformen und der (Maximal)Konzentrationen der chlorierten Verbindungen sowohl im Vergleich zu den entsprechenden unchlorierten Verbindungen als auch im Vergleich zu anderen chlorierten Aromaten konnen die Bildungsmechanismen der nachgewiesenen Chloraromaten in den meisten Fallen individuell interpretiert werden. Auch der Vergleich der Chemie der chlorierten Aromaten in den verschiedenen chlordotierten Flammen dieser Arbeit liefert diesbezuglich oftmals entscheidende Hinweise. Daneben konnen durch die Analyse chlordotierter Benzolflammen auch eine Reihe neuer Erkenntnisse bezuglich der Chemie unchlorierter Aromaten und Radikale in chlorfreien Benzolflammen gewonnen werden.",2000,
Body mass and parental decisions in the Antarctic petrel Thalassoica antarcticaâ€Š: how long should the parents guard the chick?,"Abstract In Procellariiformes, the parents guard the chick after it has attained homeothermy. This strategy may reduce the probability that a small chick is taken by predators, but is costly as only one parent can forage at a time. The decision to leave the chick may therefore be a compromise between the chick's vulnerability to predators, the body condition of the parent on the nest and whether the foraging parent returns in time. We studied how the number of days that parents guarded the chick was related to the body mass of the parent at the nest and the time the foraging parent spent at sea in the Antarctic petrel Thalassoica antarctica. We also examined how the body mass of the parent on the nest and the duration of the foraging trips influenced the chicks' body condition at the end of the guarding period. When the foraging parent did not return to the nest in time to relieve its mate, the number of days the parent on the nest kept guarding the chick was positively related to its body mass on arrival in the colony. The number of days the foraging parent spent at sea was positively related to the body mass of its mate, but those that returned in time had a shorter stay at sea relative to their mate's body mass than those that did not return before their mate had left. Apparently, both the body mass of the parent at the nest and the ability of the foraging parent to adjust its stay at sea to the mate's body mass is important for the number of days the parents guard the chick and also the chick's body condition at this point. The inability to return to the nest before the mate has left may be the result of needing a minimum amount of time at sea to find food, or because some parents having low foraging success and therefore prolong their stay at sea.",1998,Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology

Integrating species-centric and geomorphic-centric views of interior least tern and piping plover habitat selection,"The Federally endangered interior least tern (Sterna antillarum athalassos) and threatened piping plover (Charadrius melodus) nest on emergent sandbars in several braided rivers in the USA. Previous habitat selection and geomorphic investigations identified a relationship between channel width and nesting incidence. Species-centric analyses indicate selection for the widest available channels whereas geomorphic-centric analyses indicate the probability of species occurrence was higher in narrow channels that better supported suitable sandbar habitat. Given the disparate conclusions from each of these perspectives, we examined species use in relation to channel-width metrics across segments of the Platte, Niobrara, and Loup Rivers from both perspectives. We found the probability of nesting incidence increased with increased maximum unvegetated channel width in all river segments. However, maximum unvegetated width decreased with increased total channel width once total width exceeded 300 m in the central Platte River and 500 m in all other river segments as did the probability that the channel was free of permanently-vegetated islands. Channels within the Lower Platte, Loup and Niobrara River systems with total widths of 500-800 m appear to be both wide enough to have a high probability of nesting incidence and narrow enough to be free of vegetated islands. Actions that affect channels with total, bank-to-bank widths of <500 m and >800 m would likely have a small influence on species use while actions that change the width characteristics of 500-800 m channels could have a strong negative or positive influence on species use. Integrating species- and geomorphic-centric views into a single analysis provided a fuller picture of the relationship between species use and channel-width metrics.",2018,Heliyon
Chemical Defense of the Caribbean Reef Sponge Axinella corrugata Against Predatory Fishes,"Field and laboratory experiments were performed to investigate the palatability to predatory fishes of organic extracts and purified compounds from the Caribbean reef sponge Axinella corrugata (=Teichaxinella morchella). When incorporated into artificial foods at the same volumetric concentration as found in sponge tissue, crude extracts of the sponge, as well as a butanol-soluble partition of the crude extract, deterred feeding of the Caribbean reef fish Thalassoma bifasciatum in laboratory aquarium assays and deterred feeding of a natural assemblage of fishes in assays performed on reefs where A. corrugata is found. Bioassay-directed fractionation of the butanol-soluble partition led to the isolation of a single compound responsible for feeding deterrency, stevensine, a previously described dibrominated alkaloid. The mean concentration of stevensine in A. corrugata, as determined by quantitative NMR analysis, was 19.0 mg/ml (N = 8, SD = 7.2 mg/ml). Stevensine deterred feeding in laboratory aquarium assays at concentrations >2.25 mg/ml, and deterred feeding in field assays at ~12 mg/ml. Stevensine represents another in the oroidin class of brominated pyrrole derivatives that function as chemical defenses of sponges in the families Axinellidae and Agelasidae.",2004,Journal of Chemical Ecology

Cox-LASSO Analysis Reveals a Ten-lncRNA Signature to Predict Outcomes in Patients with High-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer.,"High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is one of the most common and lethal gynecological cancers. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles and act as prognostic biomarkers of ovarian cancer. However, few studies have focused on the prognostic prediction of lncRNAs solely in HGSOC. In this study, we identified candidate lncRNAs for a prognostic evaluation by examining reannotated lncRNA expression profiles and clinical data of 343 patients with HGSOC from The Cancer Genome Atlas. We built a 10-lncRNA signature using Cox-LASSO regression to predict the prognosis of patients with HGSOC. Trichotomized by the 10-lncRNA signature, high-risk patients experienced significantly shorter disease-free survival and overall survival (OS). Our novel 10-lncRNA signature showed superior predictive capacity compared to the other 2 published lncRNA signature models and clinicopathological parameters. We developed a nomogram for clinical use by integrating the 10-lncRNA signature and two clinicopathological risk factors to predict 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS. In addition, gene set enrichment analysis suggested that the group of high-risk patients was associated with mitotic spindle pathways. This model was also compatible with patients with or without BRCA1/2 mutations and had the potential to predict the response to platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy. Our findings provide a novel 10-lncRNA prognostic signature for further clinical application in patients with HGSOC and indicate the underlying mechanisms of HGSOC progression.",2019,DNA and cell biology
Ã‰valuation dâ€™un critÃ¨re dâ€™arrÃªt de croissance chez les patients anorexiques prÃ©pubÃ¨res : aire sous la courbe de poids,"INTRODUCTION : lâ€™anorexie pre pubertaire est une pathologie grave qui retentit sur plusieurs axes. Lâ€™arret de croissance en est un, il est un des enjeux du traitement car il touche 30% des jeunes anorexiques. OBJECTIF : evaluer le facteur aire sous la courbe de poids comme facteur predictif d'arret de croissance chez les jeunes atteint dâ€™anorexie pre-pubertaire. METHODE : Trente patients, pris en charge au CHU de RENNES entre janvier 2009 et juillet 2018 pour une anorexie pre-pubertaire (stade de TANNERâ‰¤2 ou Ã¢ge<12ans), ont ete classes en deux groupes : un groupe sans arret de croissance (SAC) et un groupe avec arret de croissance (AC). Lâ€™arret de la croissance etait defini par une vitesse de croissance inferieure a 3.5cm/an. Lâ€™etude des courbes de poids et de taille, nous a permis de calculer lâ€™aire entre la courbe de poids des enfants et celle attendue par rapport a leur croissance initiale. Cette derniere est le prolongement sur la meme deviation standard du dernier poids avant lâ€™apparition de lâ€™anorexie. Lâ€™aire calculee correspondait a lâ€™aire entre la courbe de poids reel et la courbe de poids attendu (Aa/o) selon la courbe initiale de lâ€™enfant en prenant comme borne le dernier poids commun aux deux courbes et lâ€™arret de croissance ou la reprise de poids sâ€™il nâ€™y avait pas dâ€™arret de croissance. RESULTATS : lâ€™Aa/o du groupe SAC etait significativement inferieure a lâ€™Aa/o du groupe AC avec p=0.030 avec le test U de Mann-Withney appropries. Apres utilisation de la methode de penalite de Lasso, le modele le plus stable selectionne est celui incluant lâ€™aire sous la courbe de poids et lâ€™Ã¢ge au diagnostic de lâ€™anorexie. La difference dâ€™Aa/o de poids reste significative entre le groupe SAC et le groupe AC. Lâ€™Aa/o a na pas depasser pour maintenir une croissance staturale est 2.475 kg.annee. CONCLUSION : Lâ€™aire sous la courbe semble etre un facteur pouvant etre predictif dâ€™un arret de croissance chez les jeunes anorexiques prepuberes.

Editorial: The Applications of New Multi-Locus GWAS Methodologies in the Genetic Dissection of Complex Traits,"Since the establishment of the mixed linear model (MLM) method for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) by Zhang et al. (2005) and Yu et al. (2006), a series of new MLM-based methods have been proposed (Feng et al., 2016). These methods have been widely used in genetic dissection of complex and omics-related traits (Figure 1), especially in conjunction with the development of advanced genomic sequencing technologies. However, most existing methods are based on single marker association in genome-wide scans with population structure and polygenic background controls. To control false positive rate, Bonferroni correction for multiple tests is frequently adopted. This stringent correction results in the exclusion of important loci, especially for large experimental error inherent in field experiments of crop genetics. To address this issue, multilocus GWAS methodologies have been recommended, i.e., mrMLM (Wang et al., 2016), ISIS EMBLASSO (Tamba et al., 2017), pLARmEB (Zhang et al., 2017), FASTmrEMMA (Wen et al., 2018a), pKWmEB (Ren et al., 2018), and FASTmrMLM (Zhang and Tamba, 2018). Here we summarize their advantages and potential limitations for using these methods (Table 1).",2019,Frontiers in Plant Science
Learning 2D Gabor Filters by Infinite Kernel Learning Regression,"Gabor functions have wide-spread applications in image processing and computer vision. In this paper, we prove that 2D Gabor functions are translation-invariant positive-definite kernels and propose a novel formulation for the problem of image representation with Gabor functions based on infinite kernel learning regression. Using this formulation, we obtain a support vector expansion of an image based on a mixture of Gabor functions. The problem with this representation is that all Gabor functions are present at all support vector pixels. Applying LASSO to this support vector expansion, we obtain a sparse representation in which each Gabor function is positioned at a very small set of pixels. As an application, we introduce a method for learning a dataset-specific set of Gabor filters that can be used subsequently for feature extraction. Our experiments show that use of the learned Gabor filters improves the recognition accuracy of a recently introduced face recognition algorithm.",2017,ArXiv
Absolute Power and Contingency: on the Theological Structure of Meillassouxâ€™s Speculative Philosophy,"Although Quentin Meillassouxâ€™s philosophy desires to be postmetaphysical and posttheological, I argue in this paper that it remains structurally theological. Specifically, I argue that Meillassouxâ€™s speculative thesis on the contingency of nature and its laws repeats at a formal level the medieval theological distinction between Godâ€™s absolute power and Godâ€™s ordained power. The first part of this paper discusses how this distinction allowed medieval theologians such as Thomas Aquinas and Duns Scotus to understand and have faith in the stable contingency of the present order of things in light of divine omnipotence. The second part of this paper discusses how Meillassoux repeats this distinction, intentionally or not, between Godâ€™s absolute power and Godâ€™s ordained power in his attempt to think the absolute contingency of the laws of nature as an effect of hyper-Chaos. Although, unlike the medieval God, Meillassouxâ€™s hyper-Chaos remains fundamentally without reason and devoid of any moral valence, I argue in the third section of this paper that Meillassoux sneaks in an existential faith in the present and future order of things with his appeal to hope in a speculative resurrection of the dead, a move that brings him further in line with the substance of the distinction between Godâ€™s absolute power and Godâ€™s ordained power.",2015,Sophia
Infection and the Tolerance for Dextrose,"Diseases of a cutaneous nature have long been associated with the ingestion of carbohydrate. The introduction of modern biochemical and micro-analytic methods has made possible the investigation of this interesting relationship. In addition the field has been enlarged, and now includes a variety of infections other than those essentially dermatologic. The problem, however, as a scientific study is complicated by the many factors involved in carbohydrate metabolism, each of which takes part in the transformations which the carbohydrate molecule undergoes in the animal body. The first studies in this field were devoted primarily to an examination of the values for blood sugar after fasting in the more common dermatoses: acne vulgaris, seborrhea, psoriasis, sycosis, eczema, dermatitis rosacea, urticaria, etc. Earlier investigators (Schwartz, Highman and Malinkin, 1 Levin and Kahn, 2 McGlasson, 3 Haldin-Davis and Wills 4 ) reported hyperglycemia with fasting in most of the aforementioned conditions.

Variable Selection via Nonconcave Penalized Likelihood in High Dimensional Medical Problems,"Variable selection is fundamental to high-dimensional statistical modelling in diverse fields of sciences. Specially in health studies, many potential factors are introduced to determine an outcome variable. In our study, different statistical methods are applied to analyze trauma annual data, collected by 30 General Hospitals in Greece. The dataset consists of 6334 observations and at most 131 factors that include demographic, transport and intrahospital data. The statistical methods employed in this work were the nonconcave penalized likelihood methods, SCAD, LASSO, and Hard, the generalized linear logistic regression, and the best subset variable selection, used to detect possible risk factors of death. A variety of different statistical models are considered, with respect to the combinations of factors and the number of observations. A comparative survey reveals differences between results and execution times of each method. The performed analysis reveals several distinct advantages of the nonconcave penalized likelihood methods over the traditional model selection techniques.",2009,International journal of applied mathematics and statistics

Structured grid AMG with stencil-collapsing for d-level circulant matrices,"SUMMARYWe introduce amultigrid method with a stencil collapsing techniquefor linear systemswhose coeï¬ƒcientmatrix A n âˆˆ R nÃ— , n = n 1 n 2 Â·Â·Â·n d is d-level circulant, that is, independent of n 1 ,n 2 ,...,n d ,the eigenvalues of A are given by its generating symbol f, a [0,2Ï€) d -periodic function, as Î» j =f(2Ï€j 1 /n 1 ,2Ï€j 2 /n 2 ,...,2Ï€j d /n d ). In the case of banded (multilevel) circulant systems, multigrid is anoptimal, i.e. O(n) solver, which is superior to FFT techniques which have complexity O(nlogn). Asthe multigrid technique introduced by Serra et al. is based on the classical AMG theory by Ruge andStuÂ¨ben, involving the Galerkin product A k = RA n R H for the deï¬nition of the coarse grid problem,the technique suï¬€ers from stencil growth, a main drawback of algebraic multigrid methods. In thepresent work, we derive coarse grid operators that are spectrally equivalent to the classical operatordeï¬ned by the Galerkin operator, while keeping the number of stencil entries constant. To do so, astencil collapsing technique, which creates sparser stencils, is applied. We will present the techniqueand show that it produces matrices that are spectrally equivalent to the original matrices for a subclassof d-level circulant matrices.

Development and validation of a 5-year mortality prediction model using regularized regression and Medicare data.,"PURPOSE
De-implementation of low-value services among patients with limited life expectancy is challenging. Robust mortality prediction models using routinely collected health care data can enhance health care stakeholders' ability to identify populations with limited life expectancy. We developed and validated a claims-based prediction model for 5-year mortality using regularized regression methods.


METHODS
Medicare beneficiaries age 66 or older with an office visit and at least 12Â months of pre-visit continuous Medicare A/B enrollment were identified in 2008. Five-year mortality was assessed through 2013. Secondary outcomes included 30-, 90-, and 180-day and 1-year mortality. Claims-based predictors, including comorbidities and indicators of disability, frailty, and functional impairment, were selected using regularized logistic regression, applying the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) in a random 80% training sample. Model performance was assessed and compared with the Gagne comorbidity score in the 20% validation sample.


RESULTS
Overall, 183Â 204 (24%) individuals died. In addition to demographics, 161 indicators of comorbidity and function were included in the final model. In the validation sample, the c-statistic was 0.825 (0.823-0.828). Median-predicted probability of 5-year mortality was 14%; almost 4% of the cohort had a predicted probability greater than 80%. Compared with the Gagne score, the LASSO model led to improved 5-year mortality classification (net reclassification indexÂ =Â 9.9%; integrated discrimination indexÂ =Â 5.2%).


CONCLUSIONS
Our claims-based model predicting 5-year mortality showed excellent discrimination and calibration, similar to the Gagne score model, but resulted in improved mortality classification. Regularized regression is a feasible approach for developing prediction tools that could enhance health care research and evaluation of care quality.",2019,Pharmacoepidemiology and drug safety
L2-Boosting for Economic Applications,"In the recent years more and more highdimensional data sets, where the number of parameters p is high compared to the number of observations n or even larger, are available for applied researchers. Boosting algorithms represent one of the major advances in machine learning and statistics in recent years and are suitable for the analysis of such data sets. While Lasso has been applied very successfully for highdimensional data sets in Economics, boosting has been underutilized in this field, although it has been proven very powerful in fields like Biostatistics and Pattern Recognition. We attribute this to missing theoretical results for boosting. The goal of this paper is to fill this gap and show that boosting is a competitive method for inference of a treatment effect or instrumental variable (IV) estimation in a high-dimensional setting. First, we present the L2Boosting with componentwise least squares algorithm and variants which are tailored for regression problems which are the workhorse for most Econometric problems. Then we show how L2Boosting can be used for estimation of treatment effects and IV estimation. We highlight the methods and illustrate them with simulations and empirical examples. For further results and technical details we refer to (?) and (?) and to the online supplement of the paper.",2017,
Plastic expression of seminal fluid protein genes in a simultaneously hermaphroditic snail,"The eukaryotic RNA exosome is an essential, multi-subunit complex that catalyzes RNA turnover, maturation, and quality control processes. Its non-catalytic donut-shaped core includes 9 subunits that associate with the 3' to 5' exoribonucleases Rrp6, and Rrp44/Dis3, a subunit that also catalyzes endoribonuclease activity. Although recent structures and biochemical studies of RNA bound exosomes from S. cerevisiae revealed that the Exo9 central channel guides RNA to either Rrp6 or Rrp44 using partially overlapping and mutually exclusive paths, several issues related to RNA recruitment remain. Here, we identify activities for the highly basic Rrp6 C-terminal tail that we term the 'lasso' because it binds RNA and stimulates ribonuclease activities associated with Rrp44 and Rrp6 within the 11-subunit nuclear exosome. Stimulation is dependent on the Exo9 central channel, and the lasso contributes to degradation and processing activities of exosome substrates in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we present evidence that the Rrp6 lasso may be a conserved feature of the eukaryotic RNA exosome.",2019,Behavioral Ecology
Applicazione Del Criterio â€œvita Sicuraâ€ Ai Tubi per Cilindri Idraulici,"Certe tipologie di recipienti in pressione, come i cilindri idraulici per macchine movimento terra, sono soggetti nella loro vita ad un alto numero di cicli a fatica e devono, allo stesso tempo, assicurare unâ€™elevata resistenza contro i sovraccarichi; questi possono essere dovuti tanto a cause accidentali che ad un uso non corretto della macchina e possono verificarsi in ogni momento della vita del componente.

Lâ€™influenza della propagazione delle cricche in presenza di sovraccarichi sullâ€™integrita dei cilindri idraulici determina il massimo difetto ammissibile per una progettazione di tipo â€œsafe lifeâ€.

Structured sparsity,"Consider a prediction or modeling problem where we have many, perhaps thousands, of candidate predictors for a particular outcome of interest. Often, the best solution from both a prediction and interpretation viewpoint is a sparse model employing only a few of these candidate predictors. This setting is now very common in modern applications, including genetic prediction of disease and image processing and compression. Indeed, methods focused on sparsity are now a huge topic in the statistics and machine learning literature. Now, consider a setting where additional structural information is available a priori about the set of candidate predictors. In view of this, we now desire a model that is both sparse and structured. That is, the selected subset of candidate predictors follows the a priori defined structure in some way. For example, if the structure is defined as a graph G over the candidate predictors, then a structured sparse solution would select a small subset of predictors representing a connected subgraph of G. In this thesis, we explore and expand upon the current methods available that achieve this composite goal. Specifically, we give three main collections of results. First, we give a new greedy algorithm for structured sparsity along with an application to HIV drug resistance. Second, we extend theoretical results from the lasso and grouped lasso to the overlapping groups lasso, a state-of-the-art method in grouped-based convex optimization learning methods. Third, we demonstrate simple and flexible extensions of sparse aggregation methods and theory which simultaneously take into account and reflect both structure and sparsity. In addition to these contributions, we give a detailed example of a real structured sparsity problem involving prediction of tsunami magnitudes.",2012,
"Il concetto di ""corridor"" nella riqualificazione urbana. Un progetto per Woodward Avenue a Detroit","Collocata nella regione dei Grandi Laghi del MidWest, Detroit e' il capoluogo della contea di Wayne, principale centro industriale dello stato del Michigan. Si affaccia lungo il fiume Detroit che fa da confine e la separa dalla citta canadese di Winsor. Come altre citta americane quali Cleveland, Pittsburg e Buffalo ha avuto un grande periodo di splendore economico e conseguentemente urbano che si e pero trasformato in decadimento. In seguito alle crisi economiche succedutesi nel corso degli anni ed al collasso dell'industria del 1935, Detroit si e lentamente disgregata, mostrando profonde problematiche dal punto di vista insediativo e sociale, dando luogo a fenomeni di degrado urbano e criminalita. 
Una continua perdita di popolazione si e verificata all'interno dei suoi confini amministrativi a favore delle aree suburbane, incrementando cosi il fenomeno dello ""sprawl"". Nel 2008 e stata perfino definita dal giornale americano Forbes come la ""most miserable american city"" (la citta americana piu miserabile dal punto di vista della vivibilita) rispetto alle altre citta degli Stati Uniti. Oggi i Detroiters si interrogano sul futuro della citta, domandandosi se con il tempo si verifichera un cambiamento radicale che sia in grado di capovolgere la situazione attuale e riattivare l'economia locale. Tale evento potrebbe essere rappresentato dal progetto di rafforzamento del sistema di trasporti pubblici riguardante il Corridor piu importante della citta: la Woodward Avenue. E' stata infatti presentata mesi fa la proposta di realizzare nei prossimi anni una nuova linea LRT (light rail system o comunemente linea tramviaria leggera) lungo un tratto della Woodward Avenue, partendo dal cuore finanziario di Downtown fino al confine amministrativo di 8mile, collocato a Nord di Detroit. 
I ""Corridors"" sono lunghi assi stradali, tipici del panorama americano: elementi urbanistici chiave nello sviluppo economico dei territori su cui sono inseriti, diventando assi di connessione tra differenti citta, regioni e stati. I corridor su scala urbana, su cui vengono comunemente implementate linee di trasporti pubblici, hanno ampi effetti positivi dal punto di vista urbano, economico e sociale sulle aree che si affacciano su di essi. Allo stesso modo quindi il progetto per la Woodward Avenue puo essere in grado di riattivare l'economia della citta, mettendo a disposizione dei cittadini un nuovo sistema di trasporto pubblico, attirando nuovi investimenti e facendo ritornare una larga fetta della popolazione a vivere in citta. 
Diverse sono le soluzioni che possono venire applicate al corridor della Woodward Avenue, ed e per questa ragione che verranno considerate piu opzioni progettuali al fine di trovare le piu adatte a risolvere le molte problematiche presenti. Si procedera con un'ipotesi di sistemazione di tale corridor, nel segmento che attraversa il quartiere di NorthEnd, per poi proporre soluzioni puntuali attribuite alle diverse parti costitutive del quartiere. In modo specifico verranno fatte delle proposte di riprogettazione dei suoi fulcri principali in corrispondenza delle nuove fermate della LRT. Un'opzione progettuale considerera anche l'idea di creare una nuova piazza in corrispondenza dell'incrocio tra la Woodward Avenue e West/East Grand Boulevard. Nella seconda parte della tesi verranno invece analizzati due casi studio di corridors: un esempio italiano di corridor che corrisponde al progetto della Variante 200 al PRG di Torino, in fase di elaborazione, e quello realizzato della Euclid Avenue a Cleveland. Entrambi i progetti possono offrire spunti progettuali ed insegnamenti da applicare al futuro corridor della Woodward Avenue, sottolineando il grande contributo che avra il nuovo LRT sul sistema infrastrutturale esistente. 
Diverse analisi urbanistiche sulle aree metropolitane di Torino e Detroit sono poi state affrontate in modo parallelo sottolineandone le differenze ed i caratteri simili. 
Tutti questi studi, analisi ed elaborazioni sono stati condotti con il fine di offrire alla citta di Detroit nuove visioni ed alternative progettuali concrete per riqualificare e rivitalizzare il tessuto urbano esistente. Sara quindi possibile capire, dopo aver visionato tutta la tesi, la grande importanza che i corridors hanno nella riattivazione dell'economia di una citta.",2012,

Exine morphology and ultrastructure of Duplicisporites from the Triassic of Italy,"A morphological study of dispersed Circumpolles pollen grains from the Upper Triassic of the Southern Alps has been initiated with the genus Duplicisporites. Individual pollen grains were studied by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Seen with SEM the pollen surface is finely verrucate with low verrucae of different sizes. A subâ€equatorial continuous rimula is clearly visible. The proximal trilete scar is small and indistinct. TEM images reveal a biâ€layered exine. The ectexine is formed by numerous small, closely packed, granulae subdivided by irregularlyâ€spaced cavities. In the region of the subequatorial canal, the ectexine becomes thinner, about 1/3 of the usual thickness. At places, the ectexine is slightly separated from the underlying endexine. The endexine is prominent and significantly darker than the ectexine. It is homogeneous and of constant thickness. On the basis of its older age, with respect to Classopollis, the present ultrastructural dataset provides information on the possible origin of cheirolepidiaceousâ€type morphology.",2005,Grana
Fine Mapping of Quantitative Trait Loci for Seed Shape Traits in Soybean,"Based on the target interval region of SSR markers Satt331-Satt592,we constructed 356 RHL-F 2 individuals(population â… ) and 168 recombinant families(population â…¡) derived from 504 F 2:6 families of the direct and reciprocal crosses of Lishuizhongzihuang with Nannong 493-1 to fine map quantitative traits loci(QTLs) for seed length(SL),width(SW),and length-to-width(SLW) ratio in soybean using composite interval mapping(CIM) and lasso approaches.Among the 168 recombinant families,only one recombinant individual was selected from a same F 2:6 family so that 142 recombinant families were constructed as population â…¢.Response variable for QTL analysis was as original observation,and the value corrected by the associated marker information.As a result,markers associated with SL were O19 and S21/Satt331 from lasso method and S21-S22 and O23-O19 from CIM method;marker associated with SW was O19/O21 from lasso method and O23-O19/O19-O21 from CIM method;and the QTL associated with markers S21-S22 for SLW was derived from QTL for SL,and the QTL with markers O23-O19/O19-O21 for SLW was derived from QTLs for SL and SW.This indicates that QTL associated with markers Satt331-Satt592 in our study was further partitioned into two pleiotropic QTLs,which were associated with markers S21-S22 and markers O23-O19/O19-O21.According to the annotation project database,Glyma10g35240 and Glyma10g34980 might be candidate genes for seed shape traits.",2013,Acta Agronomica Sinica

Advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma: pre-treatment prediction of progression based on multi-parametric MRI radiomics,"We aimed to investigate the potential of radiomic features of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to predict progression in patients with advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). One hundred and thirteen consecutive patients (01/2007-07/2013) (training cohort: n = 80; validation cohort: n = 33) with advanced NPC were enrolled. A total of 970 initial features were extracted from T2-weighted (T2-w) (n = 485) and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (CET1-w) MRI (n = 485) for each patient. We used least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) method to select features that were most significantly associated with the progression. The selected features were used to construct radiomics-based models and the predictive performance of which were assessed with respect to the area under the curve (AUC). As a result, eight features significantly associated with the progression of advanced NPC were identified. In the training cohort, a radiomic model based on combined CET1-w and T2-w images (AUC: 0.886, 95%CI: 0.815-0.956) demonstrated better prognostic performance than models based on CET1-w (AUC: 0.793, 95%CI: 0.698-0.889) or T2-w images alone (AUC: 0.813, 95%CI: 0.721-0.904). These results were confirmed in the validation cohort. Accordingly, MRI-based radiomic biomarkers present high accuracy in the pre-treatment prediction of progression in advanced NPC.",2017,Oncotarget
Risk factors for anastomotic leakage after anterior resection for rectal cancer.,"BACKGROUND
The risk factors for anastomotic leak (AL) after anterior resection have been evaluated in several studies and remain controversial as the findings are often inconsistent or inconclusive.


OBJECTIVE
To analyze the risk factors for AL after anterior resection in patients with rectal cancer.


DESIGN
Retrospective analysis.


SETTING
The Nationwide Inpatient Sample 2006 to 2009.


PATIENTS
A total of 72 055 patients with rectal cancer who underwent elective anterior resection.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
To build a predictive model for AL using demographic characteristics and preadmission comorbidities, the lasso algorithm for logistic regression was used to select variables most predictive of AL.


RESULTS
The AL rate was 13.68%. The AL group had higher mortality vs the non-AL group (1.78% vs 0.74%). Hospital length of stay and cost were significantly higher in the AL group. Laparoscopic and open resections with a diverting stoma had a higher incidence of AL than those without a stoma (15.97% vs 13.25%). Multivariate analysis revealed that weight loss and malnutrition, fluid and electrolyte disorders, male sex, and stoma placement were associated with a higher risk of AL. The use of laparoscopy was associated with a lower risk of AL. Postoperative ileus, wound infection, respiratory/renal failure, urinary tract infection, pneumonia, deep vein thrombosis, and myocardial infarction were independently associated with AL.


CONCLUSIONS
Anastomotic leak after anterior resection increased mortality rates and health care costs. Weight loss and malnutrition, fluid and electrolyte disorders, male sex, and stoma placement independently increased the risk of leak. Laparoscopy independently decreased the risk of leak. Further studies are needed to delineate the significance of these findings.",2013,JAMA surgery

In tutta la sua storia la Polonia e stata raramente abitata esclusivamente da polacchi: quasi sempre infatti nel territorio di questo Stato sono vissute numerose comunita straniere e minoranze etniche, fatto che non ha mancato di creare difficolta non sempre risolte con successo e secondo criteri di giustizia. Sopranazionale e sovraconfessionale fu gia la Polonia di Casimiro III il Grande Piast (1333-1370), e tale essa e rimasta fino all'eta contemporanea. Tale peculiarita si e conservata fino a dopo la prima guerra mondiale quando, dopo 123 anni di occupazione straniera, il paese fu ricostituito come Stato indipendente ed entro nel periodo chiamato nella storiografia la ""seconda repubblica"" (la ""prima"" essendo stata quella precedente il 1795). Fra le varie minoranze presenti sul territorio dello Stato polacco, quella bielorussa contava fra uno e due milioni di persone. La stima di questa popolazione e purtroppo assai imprecisa perche ancora nel 1931, all'atto del censimento, molti che non avevano una sufficiente coscienza della propria identita nazionale optarono per la generica definizione di ""gente del luogo"".La pubblicazione di Jerzy Turonek e appunto dedicata all'editoria in lingua bielorussa e alfabeto sia cirillico sia latino apparsa nel territorio della Polonia fra il 1921 e il 1939. Il libro si compone di due parti: nella prima l'autore presenta le istituzioni e le persone private impegnate a vario titolo in tali attivita editoriali, descrivendo anche le tematiche oggetto delle pubblicazioni, fornendo indicazioni su tirature, formati prescelti ecc. Da queste pagine emerge in modo evidente l'importanza che la citta di Vilna (attuale capitale della Lituania) ebbe nella formazione della cultura nazionale bielorussa, lungo un processo che fu fortemente ostacolato dalle autorita governative polacche e nel quale non c'e bisogno di sottolineare l'importanza del ruolo che rivesti l'editoria. L'autore riporta l'elenco delle persone che furono perseguitate a causa della loro lotta per il risveglio della coscienza nazionale bielorussa: il loro destino fu particolarmente tragico, in quanto in seguito, con l'annessione di queste terre all'Unione Sovietica e l'occupazione nazista, moltissimi di coloro che non poterono riparare all'estero furono eliminati dalla polizia segreta russa o dalla Gestapo. La seconda parte e costituita dal catalogo delle 466 pubblicazioni e stampe uscite in questo lasso di tempo (di queste 51 furono patrocinate dalla benemerita Associazione editoriale bielorussa). Nonostante l'elenco ambisca a essere completo, a causa delle limitatissime tirature di alcune pubblicazioni, delle sistematiche confische e distruzioni alle quali tale materiale fu condannato dalla polizia polacca e della naturale dispersione alla quale ogni pubblicazione nel tempo e soggetta, tanto piu nel caso di materiali particolarmente effimeri (volantini, pamphlettistica e altre stampe occasionali) e lecito supporre che una certa parte di tale produzione non vi sia rappresentata. Purtroppo l'autore non specifica quali opere siano state da lui effettivamente consultate e quali invece siano citate di seconda mano. Nonostante cio il lavoro, non molto curato dal punto di vista editoriale, costituisce un interessante contributo per la storia dell'editoria bielorussa e della politica del governo di Varsavia nei confronti delle minoranze etniche nel periodo fra le due guerre mondiali.",2012,
Probe Lasso: A novel method to rope in differentially methylated regions with 450K DNA methylation data,"The speed and resolution at which we can scour the genome for DNA methylation changes has improved immeasurably in the last 10years and the advent of the Illumina 450K BeadChip has made epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) a reality. The resulting datasets are conveniently formatted to allow easy alignment of significant hits to genes and genetic features, however; methods that parse significant hits into discreet differentially methylated regions (DMRs) remain a challenge to implement. In this paper we present details of a novel DMR caller, the Probe Lasso: a flexible window based approach that gathers neighbouring significant-signals to define clear DMR boundaries for subsequent in-depth analysis. The method is implemented in the R package ChAMP (Morris et al., 2014) and returns sets of DMRs according to user-tuned levels of probe filtering (e.g., inclusion of sex chromosomes, polymorphisms) and probe-lasso size distribution. Using a sub-sample of colon cancer- and healthy colon-samples from TCGA we show that Probe Lasso shifts DMR calling away from just probe-dense regions, and calls a range of DMR sizes ranging from tens-of-bases to tens-of-kilobases in scale. Moreover, using TCGA data we show that Probe Lasso leverages more information from the array and highlights a potential role of hypomethylated transcription factor binding motifs not discoverable using a basic, fixed-window approach.",2015,"Methods (San Diego, Calif.)"
New discriminative feature selection method,"As a kind of common method for data preprocessing, feature selection can not only improve the classification performance, but also increase the interpretability of the classification results. In sparse-learning-based feature selection methods, some useful discriminative information is ignored, and it may affect the final classification performance. To address this problem, a new discriminative feature selection method called Discriminative Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator( D-LASSO) was proposed to choose the most discriminative features. In detail, firstly, the proposed D-LASSO method contained a L1-norm regularization item, which was used to produce sparse solution. Secondly, in order to induce the most discriminative features, a new discriminative regularization term was introduced to embed the geometric distribution information of samples with the same class label and samples with different class labels. Finally, the comparison experimental results obtained from a series of Benchmark datasets show that, the proposed D-LASSO method can not only improve the classification accuracy, but also be robust against parameters.",2015,Journal of Computer Applications

Human DJ-1-specific transcriptional activation of the tyrosine hydroxylase gene,"s / Neuroscience Research 68S (2010) e223â€“e334 e305 own. We previouy reported that two types of AICD were existed. One was soluble and easily degraded form, and the other was membrane associated form. Therfore, we speculate that the accumulation of membrane associated AICD including APP C-terminal fragments may be toxic. In this study, to clear the relationship between the accumulation of AICD and toxic effects, we analzed the metabolism of AICD and the affect of AICD accumulation in cultured cells using proteomic methods. We found that APP C-terminal fragments was degraded in both gamma-secretase pathway and lysosomal pathway. On the proteomic analysis of cultured cells expressing AICDs or cultured cells with gamma-secretase inhibitor treatment, we found that nuclear-related proteins and vesicular trafficking-related proteins reduced in cultured cells expressing membrane-asscociated AICD. We will report and discuss the influence of AICDs accumulation in cultured cells. doi:10.1016/j.neures.2010.07.1352 P2-n12 Generation of disease-specific induced pluripotent stem cells from Alzheimerâ€™s disease patients Naoki Yahata 1 , Harushisa Inoue 1,2, Shiho Kitaoka 1,2, Kayoko Tsukita 1,2, Takayuki Kondo 3, Naohiro Egawa 1,3, Isao Asaka 1,2, Kazutoshi Takahashi 1,2, Tatsutoshi Nakahata 1, Shinobu Kawakatsu 4, Ryosuke Takahashi 3, Takashi Asada 2,5, Shinya Yamanaka 1 1 CiRA, iCeMS, Kyoto University 2 JST-CREST 3 Graduate School of Med., Kyoto University 4 Department of Psychiatry, Yamagata University School of Medicine 5 Department of Neuropsychiatry, University of Tsukuba Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system which causes progressive memory and cognitive decline during middle to late adult life. The cell death mechanisms and therapeutic intervention for AD have been tested by transgenic rodent models. However, these models not fully represent the human condition. Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, which show striking similarities to embryonic stem cells, can now be derived from human adult somatic tissues and have the capacity to be lineage restricted into various neuronal subtypes. Furthermore, establishment of disease-specific human cortical neurons and human cell-based AD model in vitro is crucial for investigation of the disease mechanism and drug discovery. We generated disease-specific iPS cells from patients with AD. Dermal fibroblasts from the patients were transduced with either four or three reprogramming factors, followed by emergence of putative iPS cell colonies after a few weeks. We evaluated their similarity to ES cells by checking the expression of the ES cellassociated antigens. Next, we examined the pluripotency of iPS cells by teratoma formation and embryoid body (EB) differentiation in vitro. Disease-specific iPS cells from AD patients possess properties of ES cells with patient-specific genetic information and may contribute to explore the pathogenesis of AD. doi:10.1016/j.neures.2010.07.1353 P2-n13 Microarray profiling of gene expression in the aging monkey brain Sayuri Higaki 1 , Akira Sato 2, Toshio Kojima 2,3, Takao Oishi 1 1 Sect Systems Neurosci, Primate Res Inst, Kyoto Univ, Inuyama 2 Computational Systems Biol Res Group, RIKEN, Yokohama 3 Res Equipment Center, Hamamatsu Univ Sch of Med, Hamamatsu Aging of the primate proceeds slowly and is characterized by prominent senescence, i.e., prolonged survival after reproductive years. To further our understanding of the characteristic aging process of the primate brain, we conducted DNA microarray analysis of Brodmannâ€™s area 46 (A46) and hippocampus in aged monkeys, because these areas are thought to be important for the process of learning and memory. Monkeys (n = 24) were assigned into 4 groups based on age (young; mean age 10.0 and aged; mean age 26.3) and sex (female and male). RNA isolated from 48 brain tissues was applied to the 4 Ã— 44K Rhesus Monkey Oligo Microarrays (Agilent). For 1205 genes expressed differentially more than 1.5 fold between young and aged monkey hippocampus or A46, we employed GSEA (Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) to evaluate whether pre-defined set of genes shows statistically significant, concordant differences. In aged female hippocampus but not male hippocampus, homeostasis-related gene sets were significantly upregulated (FDR q-value < 0.25). The hyper-expression of genes encoding chemokine and complement proteins engaged in immunoregulatory and anti-inflammatory activity implies age-related inflammation or disease progression. Moreover, in aged female hippocampus and A46, gene set involved in neurological system process was significantly downregulated (FDR q-value < 0.25). The decreased expression of genes encoding neuropeptide Y, somatostatin, cortistatin, corticotropin releasing hormone and 5HT2A receptor may lead to neuronal hypofunction in these regions. On the other hand, male hippocampus and A46 did not present significant age-related differences in any gene sets. These sex differences in brain aging process may result from molecular and cellular deterioration caused by drastic change in hormonal dynamics in aged female monkeys. doi:10.1016/j.neures.2010.07.1354 P2-n14 tert-Butylhydroquinone protects dopaminergic neurons from MPP+ cytotoxicity primarily via normalization of glutathione levels in midbrain slice cultures Yukie Sato , Akinori Hisatsune, Yoichiro Isohama, Hiroshi Katsuki Dept Chemico-pharmacol Sci, Grad Sch Pharm Sci, Kumamoto Univ, Kumamoto Parkinson disease is characterized by selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain, which leads to severe motor deficits including tremors and inability to initiate movement. Oxidative stress is implicated in the pathogenic events in this neurodegenerative disorder. Under conditions of increased oxidative stress, a transcription factor NF-E2-related factor (Nrf2) binds to antioxidant response element to induce expression of enzymes related to phase II detoxification and antioxidative defense. Thus, promotion of recruitment of Nrf2 can be a target of neuroprotective therapy that confers resistance to a variety of oxidative stress-related insults on neurons. Here we examined the effect of tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ), an activator of Nrf2, against of MPP+ cytotoxicity in rat midbrain slice cultures. Immunohistochemical examinations on tyrosine hydroxylase revealed that tBHQ (5â€“40 M) inhibited dopaminergic neuron loss induced by 48-h application of 30 M MPP+, in a concentration-dependent manner. Because Nrf2 activation leads to its translocation to the nucleus, we examined Nrf2 levels in nuclear fractions obtained from midbrain slice homogenates after drug treatment, by western blotting. tBHQ treatment increased Nrf2 accumulation in the nucleus in a concentration-dependent manner, which was accelerated in the presence of MPP+. We next examined possible involvement of glutathione synthesis and heme oxygenase-1 expression, two major pathways downstream of Nrf2 activation, in the neuroprotective effect of tBHQ. We found that tBHQ significantly increased glutathione content in midbrain slices, and that depletion of glutathione by buthionine sulfoximine abolished the protective effect of tBHQ against MPP+ cytotoxicity. On the other hand, inhibition of heme oxygenase by zinc protoporphyrin IX did not suppress the protective effect of tBHQ. These results suggest that tBHQ protects midbrain dopaminergic neurons via increase in glutathione synthesis. doi:10.1016/j.neures.2010.07.1355 P2-n17 Human DJ-1-specific transcriptional activation of the tyrosine hydroxylase gene Shizuma Ishikawa 1 , Takahiro Taira 2, Kazuko Takahashi-Niki 3, Takeshi Niki 1, Hiroyoshi Ariga 3, Sanae M.M.

Hokkaido University Loss-of-functional mutation in the DJ-1 gene causes a subset of familial Parkinson disease. The mechanism underlying DJ-1-related selective vulnerability in the dopaminergic pathway is, however, not resolved. DJ-1 has multiple functions, including transcriptional regulation, and one of the transcriptional target genes for DJ-1 is the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene whose product is a key enzyme for dopamine biosynthesis. It has been reported that DJ-1 is a neuroprotective transcriptional co-activator that sequesters a transcriptional co-repressor pyrimidine tract-binding protein associated splicing factor (PSF) from the TH gene promoter. In this study, we found that knockdown of human DJ-1 by small interference RNA in human dopaminergic cell lines attenuated the TH gene expression and L-DOPA production but that knockdown or knockout of mouse DJ-1 in mouse cell lines or in DJ-1 knockout mice did not affect such expression and activity of TH. Reporter assays using the human TH gene promoter linked to the luciferase gene showed that stimulation of TH promoter activity was observed in human but not mouse cells transfected with DJ-1. Although human and mouse DJ-1 were associated either with human or with mouse PSF, TH promoter activity inhibited by PSF was restored by human DJ-1 but not mouse DJ-1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that the complex of PSF with DJ-1 bound to the human but not mouse TH gene promoter. These results suggest a novel",2010,Neuroscience Research

A Panel of Novel Biomarkers Representing Different Disease Pathways Improves Prediction of Renal Function Decline in Type 2 Diabetes,"OBJECTIVE
We aimed to identify a novel panel of biomarkers predicting renal function decline in type 2 diabetes, using biomarkers representing different disease pathways speculated to contribute to the progression of diabetic nephropathy.


RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
A systematic data integration approach was used to select biomarkers representing different disease pathways. Twenty-eight biomarkers were measured in 82 patients seen at an outpatient diabetes center in The Netherlands. Median follow-up was 4.0 years. We compared the cross-validated explained variation (R2) of two models to predict eGFR decline, one including only established risk markers, the other adding a novel panel of biomarkers. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) was used for model estimation. The C-index was calculated to assess improvement in prediction of accelerated eGFR decline defined as <-3.0 mL/min/1.73m2/year.


RESULTS
Patients' average age was 63.5 years and baseline eGFR was 77.9 mL/min/1.73m2. The average rate of eGFR decline was -2.0 Â± 4.7 mL/min/1.73m2/year. When modeled on top of established risk markers, the biomarker panel including matrix metallopeptidases, tyrosine kinase, podocin, CTGF, TNF-receptor-1, sclerostin, CCL2, YKL-40, and NT-proCNP improved the explained variability of eGFR decline (R2 increase from 37.7% to 54.6%; p=0.018) and improved prediction of accelerated eGFR decline (C-index increase from 0.835 to 0.896; p=0.008).


CONCLUSIONS
A novel panel of biomarkers representing different pathways of renal disease progression including inflammation, fibrosis, angiogenesis, and endothelial function improved prediction of eGFR decline on top of established risk markers in type 2 diabetes. These results need to be confirmed in a large prospective cohort.",2015,PLoS ONE
Two new species of Microphorella Becker (Diptera: Dolichopodidae) from the Mediterranean,"Microphorella Becker is one of a small group of genera, both fossil and extant, which are currently placed in the subfamily Parathalassiinae of the Dolichopodidae s. lato (Ulrich, 2003; Sinclair & Gumming, 2006). The taxon was first proposed by Becker (1909) as a subgenus of Microphor Macquart, 1827. It currently comprises 18 named species of which seven are Nearctic (Melander, 1928; Brooks & Gumming, 2012), six Palaearctic (Ghvala, 1988; Gatt, 2003, 201 1; Shamshev, 2004), four Oriental (Shamshev & Grootaert, 2004) and one Australian (Golless, 1963). Four species M. curtipes (Becker, 1910) (north Italy, Gorsica & Sardinia), M. ulrichi Gatt, 2003 (Tunisia & Morocco), M. nierzi Gatt, 2003 (Malta, Gyprus & Turkey) and M. cassari Gatt, 2011 (Tunisia) are currently known from the Mediterranean, the latter three exclusively so. A further two, closely related species, one from Israel and another from Tunisia are described here. More undescribed species are known from the Mediterranean (Gatt, in prep.) and it is becoming increasingly apparent that this subregion is a biodiversity hotspot for the genus. Microphorella belongs to a group of four genera which includes Thalasso phorus Saigusa, 1986, Chimerothalassius Shamshev & Grootaert, 2002 and Eothalassius Shamshev & Grootaert, 2005. At present it remains poorly defined and may be paraphyletic with respect to at least Eothalassius and Thalassophorus (Gumming & Brooks, 2006). Species of Microphorella are minute, cryptic flies with inconspicuous habits and which blend perfectly well with their surroundings (sandy beaches, gravel and sand in river beds, and moist rocks in streams). They are therefore often overlooked and poorly represented in collections.",2012,Revue Suisse De Zoologie
Entropy Driven Height Profile Estimation with Multiple UAVs under Sparsity Constraints,"This paper shows an application of a multi-agent distributed learning system for UAV-based exploration under sparsity constraints. It is assumed that Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) cooperatively explore a static spatial field that can be represented with a few non-zero coefficients, i.e., the model of a process is sparse. The recovery of the sparse model in a distributed setting is solved with a Distributed LASSO (DLASSO) algorithm that implements an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Based on the cooperatively estimated model, a swarm of UAVs decides on its next movements using optimal experiment design strategies. To this end, second order information of the optimization problem is approximated using a theory of slantly differentiable functions. Also, an additional adaptive trade-off parameter between exploration of new areas and exploitation of the already obtained information is proposed and tested. The experiments are performed in a laboratory environment with two UAVs measuring a height profile with an ultrasonic sensor. The experiments show that the proposed method is very useful for time consuming measurements, if the observed process can be assumed to be sparse. Also, the adaptive method increases the overall system performance with respect to the number of measurements.",2017,2017 IEEE Globecom Workshops (GC Wkshps)

Robust Turbo Analog Error Correcting Codes Based on Analog CRC Verification,"In this paper, a new analog error correcting code with an iterative decoder is presented for real-valued signals corrupted by impulsive noises. In the proposed algorithm, a redundancy coding matrix is implemented as an analog version of the cyclic redundancy check (CRC) that is commonly used for data verification in digital communication. On the basis of this analog CRC, we propose an alternate decoding scheme with iterative decoding. In each iteration of the algorithm, the problem of decoding the long block code is decoupled into a set of parallel LP/LASSO subproblems. In the sparse noise model, this leads to a significant reduction in decoding complexity as compared to one-step convex programming decoding. The new code has improved correction capability compared to Zanko et al. In the almost sparse noise model, energy detectors are used to verify the decoding correctness of the inner code before transferring the result to the next iteration. In this case, the Turbo decoder shows little loss compared to the oracle bound based on least squares when the impulsive noises are perfectly known at the receiver.",2016,IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing

The Lasso Peptide Siamycin-I Targets Lipid II at the Gram-Positive Cell Surface.,"Ribosomally synthesized post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) are a diverse class of biologically active molecules produced by many environmental bacteria. While thousands of these compounds have been identified, mostly through genome mining, a relatively small number has been investigated at the molecular level. One less understood class of RiPPs is the lasso peptides. These are 20-25 amino acid residue compounds bearing an N-terminal macrocyclic ring and a C-terminal tail that is threaded through the ring. We have carried out a detailed investigation on the mechanism of action of the siamycin-I lasso peptide. We demonstrate that siamycin-I interacts with lipid II, the central building block of the major cell wall component peptidoglycan, which is readily accessible on the outside of the cell. This interaction compromises cell wall biosynthesis in a manner that activates the liaI stress response. Additionally, resistance to siamycin-I can be brought about by mutations in the essential WalKR two-component system that causes thickening of the cell wall. Siamycin-I is the first lasso peptide that has been shown to inhibit cell wall biosynthesis.",2019,ACS chemical biology

Regularized Taylor Echo State Networks for Predictive Control of Partially Observed Systems,"The existing neural networks suffer from partial observation while modeling and controlling dynamic systems. In this paper, a new linearized recurrent neural network, the Taylor expanded echo state network (TESN), is proposed for predictive control of partially observed dynamic systems. Two schemes of regularization, ridge regression and sparse regression, are imposed on TESNs to tackle the issue of ill-conditioned estimation. Furthermore, two estimators, lasso and elastic net, are investigated for sparse regression. Regularized learning is found to improve the estimation consistency of readout coefficients and, at the same time, suppress the accumulation of linearization residues in a prediction horizon. A series of experiments was carried out, and the results verified that regularized learning is contributive to TESNs in predictive control of partially observed dynamic systems.",2016,IEEE Access
On Constrained Sparse Matrix Factorization,"Various linear subspace methods can be formulated in the notion of matrix factorization in which a cost function is minimized subject to some constraints. Among them, constraints on sparseness have received much attention recently. Some popular constraints such as non-negativity, lasso penalty, and (plain) orthogonality etc have been so far applied to extract sparse features. However, little work has been done to give theoretical and experimental analyses on the differences of the impacts of different constraints within a framework. In this paper, we analyze the problem in a more general framework called Constrained Sparse Matrix Factorization (CSMF). In CSMF, a particular case called CSMF with non-negative components (CSMFnc) is further discussed. Unlike NMF, CSMFnc allows not only additive but also subtractive combinations of non-negative sparse components. It is useful to produce much sparser features than those produced by NMF and meanwhile have better reconstruction ability, achieving a trade-off between sparseness and low MSE value. Moreover, for optimization, an alternating algorithm is developed and a gentle update strategy is further proposed for handling the alternating process. Experimental analyses are performed on the Swimmer data set and CBCLface database. In particular, CSMF can successfully extract all the proper components without any ghost on Swimmer, gaining a significant improvement over the compared well-known algorithms.",2007,2007 IEEE 11th International Conference on Computer Vision

Such a connection allows us to take advantage of the recently developed quick LASSO algorithm to compute the empirical Bayes estimate, and provides a new way to select the tuning parameter in the LASSO method. Unlike previous empirical Bayes variable selection methods, which in most practical situations can be implemented only through a greedy stepwise algorithm, our method gives a global solution efficiently. Simulations and real examples show that the proposed method is very competitive in terms of variable selection, estimation accuracy, and computation speed compared with other variable selection and estimation methods.",2005,Journal of the American Statistical Association
Integrability-regularized phase unwrapping via sparse error correction,"We propose a new formulation of the classical two-dimensional phase unwrapping problem. Using a sparse-error, gradient-domain measurement model, we simultaneously seek the absolute phase and sparse gradient errors that minimize a novel energy functional that strongly encourages the integrability of the corrected gradient field. Our approach can be cast as a generalized lasso problem, and we compute the solution using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. Adopting a commonly-used inter-ferometric synthetic aperture radar noise model, we evaluate our technique for several synthetic surfaces.",2015,2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)
A computational model for biosonar echoes from foliage,"Since many bat species thrive in densely vegetated habitats, echoes from foliage are likely to be of prime importance to the animals' sensory ecology, be it as clutter that masks prey echoes or as sources of information about the environment. To better understand the characteristics of foliage echoes, a new model for the process that generates these signals has been developed. This model takes leaf size and orientation into account by representing the leaves as circular disks of varying diameter. The two added leaf parameters are of potential importance to the sensory ecology of bats, e.g., with respect to landmark recognition and flight guidance along vegetation contours. The full model is specified by a total of three parameters: leaf density, average leaf size, and average leaf orientation. It assumes that all leaf parameters are independently and identically distributed. Leaf positions were drawn from a uniform probability density function, sizes and orientations each from a Gaussian probability function. The model was found to reproduce the first-order amplitude statistics of measured example echoes and showed time-variant echo properties that depended on foliage parameters. Parameter estimation experiments using lasso regression have demonstrated that a single foliage parameter can be estimated with high accuracy if the other two parameters are known a priori. If only one parameter is known a priori, the other two can still be estimated, but with a reduced accuracy. Lasso regression did not support simultaneous estimation of all three parameters. Nevertheless, these results demonstrate that foliage echoes contain accessible information on foliage type and orientation that could play a role in supporting sensory tasks such as landmark identification and contour following in echolocating bats.",2017,PLoS ONE
Structure identification and variable selection in geographically weighted regression models,"ABSTRACT Geographically weighted regression (GWR) is an important tool for exploring spatial non-stationarity of a regression relationship, in which whether a regression coefficient really varies over space is especially important in drawing valid conclusions on the spatial variation characteristics of the regression relationship. This paper proposes a so-called GWGlasso method for structure identification and variable selection in GWR models. This method penalizes the loss function of the local-linear estimation of the GWR model by the coefficients and their partial derivatives in the way of the adaptive group lasso and can simultaneously identify spatially varying coefficients, nonzero constant coefficients and zero coefficients. Simulation experiments are further conducted to assess the performance of the proposed method and the Dublin voter turnout data set is analysed to demonstrate its application.",2017,Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation
Causality for General LTL-definable Properties,"In this paper we provide a notion of causality for the violation of general Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) properties. The current work is a natural extension of the previously proposed approach handling causality in the context of LTL-definable safety properties. The major difference is that now, counterexamples of general LTL properties are not merely finite traces, but infinite lasso-shaped traces. We analyze such infinite counterexamples and identify the relevant ordered occurrences of causal events, obtained by unfolding the looping part of the lasso shaped counterexample sufficiently many times. The focus is on LTL properties from practical considerations: the current results are to be implemented in QuantUM, a tool for causality checking, that exploits explicit state LTL model checking.",2018,CoRR
Simple expressions of the LASSO and SLOPE estimators in small-dimension,"We study the LASSO and SLOPE estimators when the design X satisfies ker(X) = 0. We state that, even if the design is not orthogonal, even if residuals are correlated, up to a transformation, the LASSO and SLOPE estimators have a simple expression based on the best linear unbiased estimator.",2019,
Identification of biomarkerâ€byâ€treatment interactions in randomized clinical trials with survival outcomes and highâ€dimensional spaces,"Stratified medicine seeks to identify biomarkers or parsimonious gene signatures distinguishing patients that will benefit most from a targeted treatment. We evaluated 12 approaches in high-dimensional Cox models in randomized clinical trials: penalization of the biomarker main effects and biomarker-by-treatment interactions (full-lasso, three kinds of adaptive lasso, ridge+lasso and group-lasso); dimensionality reduction of the main effect matrix via linear combinations (PCA+lasso (where PCA is principal components analysis) or PLS+lasso (where PLS is partial least squares)); penalization of modified covariates or of the arm-specific biomarker effects (two-I model); gradient boosting; and univariate approach with control of multiple testing. We compared these methods via simulations, evaluating their selection abilities in null and alternative scenarios. We varied the number of biomarkers, of nonnull main effects and true biomarker-by-treatment interactions. We also proposed a novel measure evaluating the interaction strength of the developed gene signatures. In the null scenarios, the group-lasso, two-I model, and gradient boosting performed poorly in the presence of nonnull main effects, and performed well in alternative scenarios with also high interaction strength. The adaptive lasso with grouped weights was too conservative. The modified covariates, PCA+lasso, PLS+lasso, and ridge+lasso performed moderately. The full-lasso and adaptive lassos performed well, with the exception of the full-lasso in the presence of only nonnull main effects. The univariate approach performed poorly in alternative scenarios. We also illustrate the methods using gene expression data from 614 breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy.",2017,Biometrical Journal. Biometrische Zeitschrift
Semi-Stochastic Frank-Wolfe Algorithms with Away-Steps for Block-Coordinate Structure Problems,"We propose a semi-stochastic Frank-Wolfe algorithm with away-steps for regularized empirical risk minimization and extend it to problems with block-coordinate structure. Our algorithms use adaptive step-size and we show that they converge linearly in expectation. The proposed algorithms can be applied to many important problems in statistics and machine learning including regularized generalized linear models, support vector machines and many others. In preliminary numerical tests on structural SVM and graph-guided fused LASSO, our algorithms outperform other competing algorithms in both iteration cost and total number of data passes.",2016,arXiv: Optimization and Control

Cultural and Chemical Control of Weeds in Gram and Peas1,"The herbicides viz. Tok E-25 at 1.5 kg ai/ha, Lasso at 1.0 kg ai/ha both as pre-emergence and Treflan at 1.0 kg ai/ha and Sirmate at 6L/ha both as pre-planting were tried alongwith one hoeing each at 30 and 45 days, two hoeings at 30 and 45 days after sowing, weed free and weedy check treatments for the control of weeds in gram (Cicer arietinum L.) and peas (Pisum sativum L.) during the years 1971â€“72 and 1972â€“73. As regards the cultural treaments, weed free gave the higheest yield of gram and peas which was followed by two hoeings. The lowest yield was recorded in the weedy check treatment which was almost half than that of weed free treatment. Among the herbicides tried, Tok E-25 gave the highest yield in case of gram and peas but it was significantly higher in peas only when compared to other herbicides used. Similarly the dry matter production of weeds was minimum under weed free and Tok E-25 treatments, where as it was maximum under weedy check treatment.",1975,Indian Journal of Weed science
