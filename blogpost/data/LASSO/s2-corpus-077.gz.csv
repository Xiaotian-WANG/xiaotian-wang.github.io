Canon and Proclamation: Sermons for Our Times,"What role does the sermon play in the life of the church? How does one preach on the basis of Scripture as canon? What aspects of preaching are crucial for a renaissance of proclamation in the community of faith today? This volume answers, by way of example, these and other questions central to the task of Christian preaching.Building on Brevard Childs's theological perspective on canon, Paul McGlasson's highly original book addresses the relation of Scripture and contemporary proclamation through the week-to-week experience of preaching in a local church. The sermons included in this collection are not only gems in their own right but also illustrate a new theology of proclamation for other preachers seeking practical help in formulating sermons that bring Scripture to bear on the challenges of modern life.",2000,

Various Ferroelectric Configurations in Liquid Crystals,"Abstract. In this paper, we study ferroelectric con gurations ofliquid crystals by nonlocal interaction energy associated with thepolarization. 1. IntroductionLet be a bounded domain occupied by a ferroelectric liquid crys-tal. In a system of ferroelectric liquid crystals, the polarization vector eld p;jpj= 1, plays an important role in the equilibrium states of thesystem. There are two very distinct types which depend on the net po-larization. In this case, several types of local polarization arrangementsare possible to produce the total value of the polarization. This explainsthe observations of multiple periodic phases found in ferroelectric phasesof smectic C* [6, 14]. Assume that p = (p;0;0), The energy functionalassociated with the polarization is given byF~ =ZW(p)dx+ ZZk(x y)(p(x) p(y)) 2 dydx;where W(p) = a 0 4 (p 2 1) ;a 0 >0;>0;and q(x) =R k(x y)p(y)dysatis es(1.1) q+ q= pin :We note that the term W(p) forces pto have values 1.

Optimal and sequential design for bridge regression with application in organic chemistry,"This thesis presents and applies methods for the design and analysis of experiments for a family of coefficient shrinkage methods, known collectively as bridge regression, with emphasis on the two special cases of ridge regression and the lasso. The application is the problem of understanding and predicting the melting point of small molecule organic compounds using chemical descriptors. Experiments typically have a large number of predictors compared to the number of observations, and high correlations between pairs of predictors. In this thesis, bridge regression is used to select linear models which are then compared to models selected by more commonly used methods of variable selection, such as subset selection and stepwise selection. Models including two-way product, or interaction, terms are also considered. A general method is developed for the selection of an optimal design when accurate estimates of the model coefficients are required. The method exploits a relationship between bridge regression and Bayesian methods which is used to develop a class of D-optimal designs. A necessary approximation to the variance-covariance matrix of coefficient estimators is derived. Designs are found using algorithmic search for ridge regression and the lasso, for experiments with (a) two-level factors and (b) the motivating chemistry problem. Comparisons are made with alternative designs. A sequential design criterion is developed to enhance an existing design. The criterion selects additional design points, from a finite set of candidate points, that exhibit the highest estimated prediction variance obtained from bootstrapping. The method is applied to the Bayesian D-optimal designs and is shown to be capable of improving design performance through the addition of only a small number of runs",2011,
The diagnostic nomogram of platelet-based score models for hepatic alveolar echinococcosis and atypical liver cancer,"Hepatic alveolar echinococcosis (HAE) and liver cancer had similarities in imaging results, clinical characteristics, and so on. And it is difficult for clinicians to distinguish them before operation. The aim of our study was to build a differential diagnosis nomogram based on platelet (PLT) score model and use internal validation to check the model. The predicting model was constructed by the retrospective database that included in 153 patients with HAE (66 cases) or liver cancer (87 cases), and all cases was confirmed by clinicopathology and collected from November 2011 to December 2018. Lasso regression analysis model was used to construct data dimensionality reduction, elements selection, and building prediction model based on the 9 PLT-based scores. A multi-factor regression analysis was performed to construct a simplified prediction model, and we added the selected PLT-based scores and relevant clinicopathologic features into the nomogram. Identification capability, calibration, and clinical serviceability of the simplified model were evaluated by the Harrellâ€™s concordance index (C-index), calibration plot, receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), and decision curve. An internal validation was also evaluated by the bootstrap resampling. The simplified model, including in 4 selected factors, was significantly associated with differential diagnosis of HAE and liver cancer. Predictors of the simplified diagnosis nomogram consisted of the API index, the FIB-4 index, fibro-quotent (FibroQ), and fibrosis index constructed by Kingâ€™s College Hospital (Kingâ€™s score). The model presented a perfect identification capability, with a high C-index of 0.929 (0.919 through internal validation), and good calibration. The area under the curve (AUC) values of this simplified prediction nomogram was 0.929, and the result of ROC indicated that this nomogram had a good predictive value. Decision curve analysis showed that our differential diagnosis nomogram had clinically identification capability. In conclusion, the differential diagnosis nomogram could be feasibly performed to verify the preoperative individualized diagnosis of HAE and liver cancer.",2019,Scientific Reports
The effect of artificial light on escapement beneath a survey trawl,"An underwater video system is under investigation by the National Marine Fisheries Service for use in studying the capture efficiency of a survey bottom trawlâ€™s footrope in diverse habitats commonly sampled during surveys. This system utilizes a 50-watt quartz halogen light since most survey stations are at depths greater than natural light can penetrate for low-light camera use. One potential shortcoming to this approach is that the light emitted might alter fish behaviour and thereby bias estimates of escapement. The light effect on escapement was examined by attaching the video system onto a trawl fitted with an auxiliary capture bag to retain those fish which would have otherwise escaped beneath. A paired towing experiment (unlit vs. lit) was conducted to test the hypothesis that there is no effect on capture proportion due to the addition of artificial light. ANOVA was used to test for the effect both fish length and water depth had on escapement. Since neither length nor depth were significant, a paired t test (Î±=0.05) was used to test the null hypothesis. For five of the six species examined, we found no effect of the light on fish escapement. Only flathead sole (Hippoglossoides elassodon) showed a statistically significant difference in capture proportion due to artificial light, the proportion decreasing by 0.0698.",1999,Ices Journal of Marine Science
Stochastic methods for l1 regularized loss minimization,"We describe and analyze two stochastic methods for l1 regularized loss minimization problems, such as the Lasso. The first method updates the weight of a single feature at each iteration while the second method updates the entire weight vector but only uses a single training example at each iteration. In both methods, the choice of feature/example is uniformly at random. Our theoretical runtime analysis suggests that the stochastic methods should outperform state-of-the-art deterministic approaches, including their deterministic counterparts, when the size of the problem is large. We demonstrate the advantage of stochastic methods by experimenting with synthetic and natural data sets.",2009,
Bayesian projection approaches to variable selection and exploring model uncertainty,"A Bayesian approach to variable selection which is based on the expected Kullback-Leibler divergence between the full model and its projection onto a submodel has recently been suggested in the literature. Here we extend this idea by considering projections onto subspaces defined via some form of $L_1$ constraint on the parameter in the full model. This leads to Bayesian model selection approaches related to the lasso. In the posterior distribution of the projection there is positive probability that some components are exactly zero and the posterior distribution on the model space induced by the projection allows exploration of model uncertainty. We also consider use of the approach in structured variable selection problems such as ANOVA models where it is desired to incorporate main effects in the presence of interactions. Here we make use of projections related to the non-negative garotte which are able to respect the hierarchical constraints. We also prove a consistency result concerning the posterior distribution on the model induced by the projection, and show that for some projections related to the adaptive lasso and non-negative garotte the posterior distribution concentrates on the true model asymptotically.",2009,arXiv: Methodology

Subspecies of the Least Tern in Mexico,"Debate about the validity of the subspecies of the Least Tern (Sterna antillarum) has been contentious and confusing, and a recent paper by Garcia and Ceballos (1995) describing Least Terns nesting in Jalisco, Mexico, has further confused the issue. Although their article makes a valuable contribution in documenting nesting of the Least Tern in Jalisco (cf. Grant 1964), their taxonomic treatment is misleading. Not only did they extend the known breeding range of S. a. browni, the California Least Tern, hundreds of kilometers to the south of its described range (AOU 1957, and below), they called the subspecific status of S. a. browni ""well-defined,"" yet called S. a. mexicana and S. a. staebleri, the only two subspecies known to breed in mainland Mexico, ""uncertain"" (presumably with regard to taxonomy). We strongly question their taxonomic assignment of the breeding Least Terns in Jalisco, which seems to be based only on their dismissal of mexicana and staebleri as valid taxa. Based on known range, the Least Terns breeding in Jalisco are probably referable to S. a. mexicana and should be assumed to be such until a formal taxonomic revision is accomplished. Indeed, recent records of summering/breeding Least Terns in Nayarit (L. R. Hays and S. N. G. Howell, pers. comm.) and Colima (S. N. G. Howell, pers. comm.), along with earlier reports from Nayarit (Alden 1969) and Jalisco (Grant 1964), suggest that mexicana is distributed coastally from Sonora south through Colima. Without specimen evidence, we strongly question the taxonomic treatment employed by Garcia and Ceballos (1995) as unfortunately conflating the taxonomic status of several heretofore valid subspecies. The taxonomy of the Least Tern has had a storied history. The Least Tern was formerly considered conspecific with the Little Tern (S. albifrons) of the Old World, but analysis of morphology and especially vocalizations (Massey 1976) led to its treatment as a full species by the AOU (1983). Given that Massey analyzed only three taxa in the complex (4-7 species and up to 11 additional subspecies worldwide), we believe that her study was incomplete and that the significance of her results has been exaggerated regarding the distinctness of Little and Least Terns. To that end, the British Ornithologists' Union is currently evaluating records of the Least Tern in Britain and comparing vocalizations of the west African subspecies of the Little Tern S. a. guineae to those of nominate Little Tern and of the Least Tern (Scott and Dickson 1996). There are five described subspecies of the Least Tern: athalassos, antillarum, browni, mexicana, and staebleri. A brief synopsis of each follows, ordered by date of description. A summary of Old World forms of S. albifrons was presented by Cramp (1985). The character diagnoses we provide are based mainly on the original descriptions of the subspecies. No quantitative data exists that would allow assessment of reliability of these characters or their degree of overlap with other taxa. S. a. antillarum (Lesson). This coastal subspecies was originally described by Lesson (1847). It ranges as a breeder locally along the Atlantic Coast from Massachusetts south through the Caribbean to Venezuela, and westward along the Gulf of Mexico to Texas. It apparently winters coastally from eastern Mexico and Central America south through northern Brazil (Friedmann et al. 1950, Blake 1977). Least Terns recorded from Panama may be of this subspecies, S. a. athalassos, or S. a. browni (Wetmore 1965), or perhaps S. a. mexicana or S. a. staebleri. S. a. browni Mearns. This subspecies breeds along the Pacific Coast from central California through Baja California. Wilbur (1987) considered all Least Terns breeding in Baja California to be browni, although he provided no reasons or diagnosis; Palacios and Mellink (1996) considered the subspecific identity of terns breeding in the northern Gulf of California to be unclear. The winter range of browni is largely unknown, but the AOU (1957) suggested that this subspecies winters from the Gulf of California south to Guatemala, with definite records of banded birds from Colima and Guatemala (Massey 1981). Examples ofbrowni are said to differ from nominate birds in being smaller-bodied, with more black on the outer primaries, but are otherwise similar in plumage (Mearns 1916). Neither morphometric nor genetic differences could be found by Burleigh and Lowery (1942), Massey (1976), Thompson et al. (1992), or Olsen and Larsson (1995), leading the first three to question the validity of this subspecies. S. a. mexicana van Rossem and Hachisuka. This subspecies breeds from northern or central Sonora southward along the Pacific Coast of Mexico through at least Sinaloa (van Rossem and Hachisuka 1937, Friedmann et al. 1950), although birds in northwestern Sonora (Mellink and Palacios 1993) and northeastern and southern Baja California may pertain to this subspecies, and not to S. a. browni (Palacios and Mellink 1996); further taxonomic work is needed (either more specimens or a thorough reevaluation of existing material). Its winter range is unknown. Palacios and Mellink (1996) suggested that this subspecies be reassessed I Received 11 March 1996. Accepted 24 July 1996.",1996,The Condor

On Analysis of the Trajectories of a Class of Fourth Order Nonlinear Systems Controlled by Output Feedback,"This paper introduces new theory on analysis of the trajectoriesofa classofsingleâ€“inputsingleâ€“output(SISO)fourth order nonlinear systems which is controlled by using output feedback. The studied system is written in terms of the tracking error, which is defined as the difference between the desired state trajectory and the actual trajectory, while the output is defined as the linear combination of the tracking error. Essentially, the main result is to prove that the asymptotic convergenceof the output implies that the error state trajectories are uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB). Our theoretical results are complemented with an application of the theory to the tracking control of a Furuta pendulum. Detailed numerical simulations are presented.",2013,
Pulse Wave Velocity and Machine Learning to Predict Cardiovascular Outcomes in Prediabetic and Diabetic Populations,"Few studies have addressed the predictive value of arterial stiffness determined by pulse wave velocity (PWV) in a high-risk population with no prevalent cardiovascular disease and with obesity, hypertension, hyperglycemia, and preserved kidney function. This longitudinal, retrospective study enrolled 88 high-risk patients and had a follow-up time of 12.4 years. We collected clinical and laboratory data, as well as information on arterial stiffness parameters using arterial tonometry and measurements from ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. We considered nonfatal, incident cardiovascular events as the primary outcome. Given the small size of our dataset, we used survival analysis (i.e., Cox proportional hazards model) combined with a machine learning-based algorithm/penalization method to evaluate the data. Our predictive model, calculated with Cox regression and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), included body mass index, diabetes mellitus, gender (male), and PWV. We recorded 16 nonfatal cardiovascular events (5 myocardial infarctions, 5 episodes of heart failure, and 6 strokes). The adjusted hazard ratio for PWV was 1.199 (95% confidence interval: 1.09â€“1.37, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). Arterial stiffness was a predictor of cardiovascular disease development, as determined by PWV in a high-risk population. Thus, in obese, hypertensive, hyperglycemic patients with preserved kidney function, PWV can serve as a prognostic factor for major adverse cardiac events.",2019,Journal of Medical Systems
Selecting placental measures that have clinical implications in child development and diseases.,"INTRODUCTION
Placental morphological and histopathological measures can be numerous and it is very time-consuming to collect all the information. When planning a large birth cohort study, researchers often face the dilemma as to whether and what information to collect in a placenta. The aim of this study was (1) to systematically select placental measures that have significant clinical implications, and (2) to assess the accuracy of these measures.


METHODS
We used placental pathology information from the Collaborative Perinatal Project (CPP), in which 45,785 births had comprehensive information on placental morphology and pathology. We chose 20 major childhood diseases as outcomes. The statistical method of LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) was used to select important placental measures that would have better predictability for outcomes.


RESULTS
LASSO selected 81 measures as candidates. After having consulted placental pathologists, we further narrowed down to the 38 and 23 most important measures to form two shortened evaluation systems that could be used in clinical practice and research. The sensitivity and specificity of these measures for composite child diseases were 68% and 34%, respectively, for the 38 measures and 48% and 53%, respectively, for the 23 measures.


CONCLUSIONS
We presented a potentially useful system for pathological characterization of the placenta. The use of these relatively simple and accessible characteristics as biomarkers may be considered in large birth cohort studies.",2014,Placenta
"Crossidium seriatum (Pottiaceae, Musci) New to Europe","Crossidium seriatum Crum & Steere is reported new to Europe on a specimen from Spain. The species is illustrated and notes are given on its ecology and distribution. Seven of the species of the genus Crossidium Jur. (Pottiaceae) have leaves with many or few papillae: Crossidium aberrans Holz. & Bartr., known from North America (Mexico, Arizona, British Columbia) (Delgadillo 1975; Holzinger & Bartram 1924; McIntosh 1989), Europe (France, Spain) (Pierrot 1986; Ros & Guerra 1986), Southwestern Asia (Saudi Arabia and Jordan) (Frey & Kiirschner 1988a); C. asirense Frey & Kiirschner, known from Saudi Arabia (Frey & Kiirschner 1984); C. davidai Catcheside, known from Australia (Catcheside 1980); C. rosei Williams, known from South America (Peru) (Williams 1915) and Canada (British Columbia) (McIntosh 1989) and probably conspecific with the former (McIntosh 1989); C. geheebii (Broth.) Broth., known from New Zealand, Australia (Delgadillo 1975), and Southwestern Asia (Sinai) (Frey & Kiirschner 1988a); C. deserti Frey & Kiirschner, known from Saudi Arabia (Frey & Kiirschner 1987), and C. seriatum Crum & Steere, known at the moment from California (Crum & Steere 1958) and Arizona (Zander 1977). While studying material of this genus with the aim of carrying out a revision of the taxa in the Mediterranean region, we collected a sample in Albacete (Spain) that, based on its foliar morphology, was identified as Crossidium seriatum. We have observed some morphological differences between the original description and the sample from Spain: plant size [stems 1.5(-2) mm in height]; cell size (upper lamina cells 8-20 Ocm in length; median cells 9-22 ~cm in length); and hyaline hair-point 0.16-0.88 mm in length (FIG. 1-12). Studied material.--SPAIN. ALBACETE. Murcia-Albacete road, crossroads on the way to Agramon, UTM: XH2060, 19.IV. 1991, Ros et al. (MUB 4265). We also studied isotypes of C. seriatum from DUKE, NY, and us. Habitat. -The sample collected in the Iberian Peninsula was found in very dry gypsiferous soil, with sparse nitrified grass vegetation, approximately 500 m above sea level. The major part of the taller vegetation of these soils consists of thickets with Helianthemum squamatum, Herniaria fruticosa, Lepidium graminifolium, Lygeum spartum, Ononis tridentata, and Teucrium libanitis. The average annual precipitation is approximately 300 mm and the average temperature 14.9*C, which corresponds to a semiarid ombroclimate (Alcaraz & SfanchezG6mez 1988). Crossidium seriatum appears in these areas associated with Aloina bifrons (De Not.) Delg., Crossidium crassinerve (De Not.) Jur., Didymodon aaronis (Lor.) Guerra, and Tortula revolvens (Schimp.) G. Roth. Distribution. Crossidium seriatum might be considered a very rare species. However, it may be more frequent than is known at present and perhaps only seems to be rare due to its small size, hardly visible during the dry season. There are only two localities known in the American continent (Crum & Steere 1958; Zander 1977) and one in Europe (Spain), that reported here (Fig. 13). This type of specific disjunction between the Mediterranean region and the arid zones of southwestern North America is common among xerophytic mosses of arid and semiarid zones (steppe climates) of the Northern Hemisphere (Schofield 1988). The majority of these species grow in the short periods of rainfall and are elusive during the dry period. Like C. seriatum, there are numerous species of arid circummediterranean zones that show this type of disjunction-Aloina bifrons (De Not.) Delg., Crossidium aberrans Holz. & Bartr., Desmatodon guepinii B. & S., Phascum vlassovii Laz., Pseudocrossidium revolutum (Brid.)

Exclusive feature selection and multi-view learning for Alzheimer's Disease,"Abstract In Alzheimerâ€™s Disease (AD) studies, high dimension and small sample size have been always an issue and it is common to apply a dimension reduction method to predict the early diagnosis of AD. In this paper, we propose a multi-view feature selection algorithm embedded with exclusive lasso learning and sparse learning. It extracts the feature subsets that best represent the symptoms of patients through feature selection, so as to reduce the dimension and achieve a better diagnosis rate. Firstly, in order to overcome the limitation of non-overlapping, the features under different view are clustered by fuzzy C-means clustering. Then , the exclusive group lasso learning is performed according to the clustering results and each view is sparsely learned through the l 2 , 1 - norm, resulting in better removal of redundant features. Finally, the results of each view are combined to obtain the final features subsets. This exclusive lasso learning combined through multiple views is novel in clinical practice and can effectively target AD. At the same time, the experimental results show that our method could achieve better results compared to its competing methods.",2019,J. Vis. Commun. Image Represent.
Experimental assessment of the accuracy of genomic selection in sugarcane,"Sugarcane cultivars are interspecific hybrids with an aneuploid, highly heterozygous polyploid genome. The complexity of the sugarcane genome is the main obstacle to the use of marker-assisted selection in sugarcane breeding. Given the promising results of recent studies of plant genomic selection, we explored the feasibility of genomic selection in this complex polyploid crop. Genetic values were predicted in two independent panels, each composed of 167 accessions representing sugarcane genetic diversity worldwide. Accessions were genotyped with 1,499 DArT markers. One panel was phenotyped in Reunion Island and the other in Guadeloupe. Ten traits concerning sugar and bagasse contents, digestibility and composition of the bagasse, plant morphology, and disease resistance were used. We used four statistical predictive models: bayesian LASSO, ridge regression, reproducing kernel Hilbert space, and partial least square regression. The accuracy of the predictions was assessed through the correlation between observed and predicted genetic values by cross validation within each panel and between the two panels. We observed equivalent accuracy among the four predictive models for a given trait, and marked differences were observed among traits. Depending on the trait concerned, within-panel cross validation yielded median correlations ranging from 0.29 to 0.62 in the Reunion Island panel and from 0.11 to 0.5 in the Guadeloupe panel. Cross validation between panels yielded correlations ranging from 0.13 for smut resistance to 0.55 for brix. This level of correlations is promising for future implementations. Our results provide the first validation of genomic selection in sugarcane.",2013,Theoretical and Applied Genetics
Predicting fatty acid profiles in blood based on food intake and the FADS1 rs174546 SNP.,"SCOPE
A high intake of n-3 PUFA provides health benefits via changes in the n-6/n-3 ratio in blood. In addition to such dietary PUFAs, variants in the fatty acid desaturase 1 (FADS1) gene are also associated with altered PUFA profiles.


METHODS AND RESULTS
We used mathematical modeling to predict levels of PUFA in whole blood, based on multiple hypothesis testing and bootstrapped LASSO selected food items, anthropometric and lifestyle factors, and the rs174546 genotypes in FADS1 from 1607 participants (Food4Me Study). The models were developed using data from the first reported time point (training set) and their predictive power was evaluated using data from the last reported time point (test set). Among other food items, fish, pizza, chicken, and cereals were identified as being associated with the PUFA profiles. Using these food items and the rs174546 genotypes as predictors, models explained 26-43% of the variability in PUFA concentrations in the training set and 22-33% in the test set.


CONCLUSION
Selecting food items using multiple hypothesis testing is a valuable contribution to determine predictors, as our models' predictive power is higher compared to analogue studies. As unique feature, we additionally confirmed our models' power based on a test set.",2015,Molecular nutrition & food research
An Alpha-Defensin Gene Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Modulates the Gut Microbiota and May Alter the Risk of Acute Graft-Versus-Host Disease,"Î±â€defensinâ€5 (HD5) accounts for 70% of the bactericidal peptide activity of Paneth cells and regulates gut microbial homeostasis. We previously reported that the G allele of rs4415345, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the gene for HD5, was associated with approximately 40% lower risk of grade II-IV aGVHD (PMID: 30004111). Considering the role of microbiota disruptions in aGVHD, we hypothesized that rs4415345G may have a specific gut microbiota signature. First, we analyzed linked host-microbiota genetic data from 248 subjects in the Human Microbiome Project to test our hypothesis in healthy individuals. With the assumption that many microbial taxa have no association with a given SNP, we used 10-fold cross-validated Lasso regression as a test of association between rs4415345 and taxon relative abundance. A single taxon (Odoribacter splanchnicus) was retained in 99% of the simulations, always with a positive association with the G allele. Next, we evaluated whether O. splanchnicus is associated with less aGVHD in 226 patients with a 16S rRNA gene-sequenced research stool sample collected between days -30 and -6 of allo-HCT. O. splanchnicus was present in 65 (29%) patients. The univariate hazard ratio (HR) of O. splanchnicus detectability for grade II-IV aGVHD was 0.70, with a 95% confidence interval (95%CI) of 0.44-1.10 (Pâ€¯=â€¯0.12). Multivariable analysis, adjusted for anti-anaerobic antibiotic exposure between days -7 and +14 yielded a similar result (HR: 0.70, 95%CI: 0.44-1.11, Pâ€¯=â€¯0.13). In summary, the G allele of rs4610776 is associated with the higher relative abundance of O. splanchnicus in healthy individuals and less aGVHD in allo-HCT recipients. In an independent dataset, O. splanchnicus presence was associated with a 30% reduction in risk for aGVHD, though this association did not reach statistical significance. O. splanchnicus is a weakly butyrogenic bacterium also capable of producing indole, and depleted in patients with IBD. Both butyrate and indole can limit aGVHD. In addition, O. splanchnicus correlates with less TNFÎ± production in response to inflammatory stimuli. We propose that O. splanchnicus may reduce aGVHD risk in rs4415345G individuals.",2020,Biology of Blood and Marrow Transplantation
Preselection bias in high dimensional regression,"In this thesis, we have studied the preselection bias that can occur when the number of covariates in a high dimensional regression problem is reduced prior to a high dimensional regression analysis like the lasso. Datasets in genomics often include tenor hundred thousands, or even millions, of covariates and a few hundred or less patients. To reduce computations or to make the problem tractable, practitioners often rank the covariates according to univariate importance for the response, and preselect some thousand covariates from the top of the list for multivariate analysis via penalized regression. If the preselection of covariates is not done in a controlled way, this leads to preselection bias. We have studied the effect of preselection on estimation and prediction and the bias this might induce. With a small preselected dataset, the lasso in combination with cross validation tends to select many covariates, which together are able to explain the data at hand very well. However, for a new independent dataset, these covariates predict rather poorly. This is preselection bias. We have visualized the preselection bias through boxplots in several different datasets from genomics and in simulated data. We have also demonstrated that the problem of preselection bias is most evident in datasets where there is a lot of noise, and where there are heavy dependencies between covariates, as the univariate ranking will not be able to capture the structure of the complex relations in this case. To be able to trust predictions made from penalized regression on preselected covariates, the preselection should be coupled with some algorithm that controls how many covariates that should be included in order to avoid the bias. We have studied methods like â€œSAFEâ€, â€œstrongâ€ and â€œfreezingâ€ that all make preselection more safe, the word safe meaning that the lasso analysis for the preselected set of covariates should conclude with the same result as if all covariates were included.",2014,
Shrinkage averaging estimation,"We discuss the impact of tuning parameter selection uncertainty in the context of shrinkage estimation and propose a methodology to account for problems arising from this issue: Transferring established concepts from model averaging to shrinkage estimation yields the concept of shrinkage averaging estimation (SAE) which reflects the idea of using weighted combinations of shrinkage estimators with different tuning parameters to improve overall stability, predictive performance and standard errors of shrinkage estimators. Two distinct approaches for an appropriate weight choice, both of which are inspired by concepts from the recent literature of model averaging, are presented: The first approach relates to an optimal weight choice with regard to the predictive performance of the final weighted estimator and its implementation can be realized via quadratic programming. The second approach has a fairly different motivation and considers the construction of weights via a resampling experiment. Focusing on Ridge, Lasso and Random Lasso estimators, the properties of the proposed shrinkage averaging estimators resulting from these strategies are explored by means of Monte-Carlo studies and are compared to traditional approaches where the tuning parameter is simply selected via cross validation criteria. The results show that the proposed SAE methodology can improve an estimatorsâ€™ overall performance and reveal and incorporate tuning parameter uncertainty. As an illustration, selected methods are applied to some recent data from a study on leadership behavior in life science companies.",2012,Statistical Papers
Late removal of retrievable caval filters.,"The advent of retrievable caval filters was a game changer in the sense, that the previously irreversible act of implanting a medical device into the main venous blood stream of the body requiring careful evaluation of the pros and cons prior to execution suddenly became a ""reversible"" procedure where potential hazards in the late future of the patient lost most of their weight at the time of decision making. This review was designed to assess the rate of success with late retrieval of so called retrievable caval filters in order to get some indication about reasonable implant duration with respect to relatively ""easy"" implant removal with conventional means, i.e., catheters, hooks and lassos. A PubMed search (www.pubmed.gov) was performed with the search term ""cava filter retrieval after 30 days clinical"", and 20 reports between 1994 and 2013 dealing with late retrieval of caval filters were identified, covering approximately 7,000 devices with 600 removed filters. The maximal duration of implant reported is 2,599 days and the maximal implant duration of removed filters is also 2,599 days. The maximal duration reported with standard retrieval techniques, i.e., catheter, hook and/or lasso, is 475 days, whereas for the retrievals after this period more sophisticated techniques including lasers, etc. were required. The maximal implant duration for series with 100% retrieval accounts for 84 days, which is equivalent to 12 weeks or almost 3 months. We conclude that retrievable caval filters often become permanent despite the initial decision of temporary use. However, such ""forgotten"" retrievable devices can still be removed with a great chance of success up to three months after implantation. Conventional percutaneous removal techniques may be sufficient up to sixteen months after implantation whereas more sophisticated catheter techniques have been shown to be successful up to 83 months or more than seven years of implant duration. Tilting, migrating, or misplaced devices should be removed early on, and replaced if indicated with a device which is both, efficient and retrievable.",2014,Swiss medical weekly

Cross-comparison of inference methods for Gaussian Graphical Models,"In Gaussian graphical modeling statistics and graph theory go hand in hand. With applications in many fields this widely applied technique is used to estimate the partial correlations among variables of a given dataset. This thesis covers four of the popular approaches within 
Gaussian graphical modeling, the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse, the Lasso (inclusion of the `1-term), the shrinkage and the bootstrap approach. These four methods will be cross compared on the basis of several tests. These tests cover the accuracy of the estimation, the computational speed and the user friendliness of each method. The first test is based on randomly generated datasets of which the true partial correlations are know. Every tested method is then applied to two datasets extracted from the R package â€™GeneNetâ€™. In the last section of this thesis it is concluded that, despite a high demand on the computational cost, the Lasso 
approach supplies the user with the most accurate estimation. However it has to be noted that it is suspected that the shrinkage approach did not achieve its full potential due to mistakes made along the journey of programming.",2018,
Group sparse Lasso for cognitive network sensing robust to model uncertainties and outliers,"a b s t r a c t To account for variations in the frequency, time, and space dimensions, dynamic re-use of licensed bands under the cognitive radio (CR) paradigm calls for innovative network-level sensing algorithms for multi-dimensional spectrum opportunity awareness. Toward this direction, the present paper develops a collaborative scheme whereby CRs cooperate to localize active primary user (PU) transmitters and reconstruct a power spectral density (PSD) map portraying the spatial distribution of power across the monitored area per frequency band and channel coherence interval. The sensing scheme is based on a parsimonious model that accounts for two forms of sparsity: one due to the narrowband nature of transmit-PSDs compared to the large portion of spectrum that a CR can sense, and another one emerging when adopting a spatial grid of candidate PU locations. Capitalizing on this dual sparsity, an estimator of the model coefficients is obtained based on the group sparse least-absolute-shrinkage-and-selection operator (GS-Lasso). A novel reduced-complexity GS-Lasso solver is developed by resorting to the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMoM). Robust versions of this GS-Lasso estimator are also introduced using a GS total least-squares (TLS) approach to cope with both uncertainty in the regression matrices, arising due to inaccurate channel estimation and grid-mismatch effects, and unexpected model outliers. In spite of the non-convexity of the GS-TLS criterion, the novel robust algorithm has guaranteed convergence to (at least) a local optimum. The analytical findings are corroborated by numerical tests. Published by Elsevier B.V.",2012,Phys. Commun.
Predicting age at loss of ambulation in Duchenne muscular dystrophy with deep phenotypic measures,"Although Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), the most common single-gene lethal disorder, is caused by a homogeneous biochemical defect in all patients, substantial patient-patient variety in disease progression is observed. The loss of ambulation (LoA) is a functional milestone of DMD progression and the age at LoA is often used as an indication of disease severity. But as age at LoA is not always available, such as when patients remain ambulant at study end, its use has been limited. In this paper, we report machine learning approaches to predict age at LoA based on clinical measures of muscular strength and motor function, and validate the algorithms using the CINRG dataset. With extensive experiments and rigorous statistical analysis, we found that (1) the utilization of multiple clinical features yields better prediction than using any of the single measures, and (2) the prediction based on Lasso is more accurate than other multivariate analytical approaches such as ordinary least squares and ridge regression. To our knowledge, we are the first to provide point predictions for age at LoA in DMD using clinical phenotypic measures. Importantly, we find that not all clinical measures contribute to the prediction. Age at the last visit (before LoA), velocity of walking 10 meters, and velocity of climbing 4 steps are selected as important predictors by Lasso. The usefulness of the prediction model is illustrated with evidence that the association between a well-known modifier of DMD severity and age at LoA has better power when the predicted values are utilized.",2014,2014 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)

QSAR Investigation on Quinolizidinyl Derivatives in Alzheimerâ€™s Disease,"Sets of quinolizidinyl derivatives of bi- and tri-cyclic (hetero) aromatic systems were studied as selective inhibitors. On the pattern, quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) study has been done on quinolizidinyl derivatives as potent inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase in alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD). Multiple linear regression (MLR), partial least squares (PLSs), principal component regression (PCR), and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) were used to create QSAR models. Geometry optimization of compounds was carried out by B3LYP method employing 6â€“31â€‰G basis set. HyperChem, Gaussian 98â€‰W, and Dragon software programs were used for geometry optimization of the molecules and calculation of the quantum chemical descriptors. Finally, Unscrambler program was used for the analysis of data. In the present study, the root mean square error of the calibration and R2 using MLR method were obtained as 0.1434 and 0.95, respectively. Also, the R and R2 values were obtained as 0.79, 0.62 from stepwise MLR model. The R2 and mean square values using LASSO method were obtained as 0.766 and 3.226, respectively. The root mean square error of the calibration and R2 using PLS method were obtained as 0.3726 and 0.62, respectively. According to the obtained results, it was found that MLR model is the most favorable method in comparison with other statistical methods and is suitable for use in QSAR models.",2013,
Using Genetic Risk Score Approaches to Infer Whether an Environmental Factor Attenuates or Exacerbates the Adverse Influence of a Candidate Gene,"Some candidate genes have been robustly reported to be associated with complex traits, such as the fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) gene on body mass index (BMI), and the fibroblast growth factor 5 (FGF5) gene on blood pressure levels. It is of interest to know whether an environmental factor (E) can attenuate or exacerbate the adverse influence of a candidate gene. To this end, we here evaluate the performance of â€œgenetic risk scoreâ€ (GRS) approaches to detect â€œgene-environment interactionsâ€ (G Ã— E). In the first stage, a GRS is calculated according to the genotypes of variants in a candidate gene. In the second stage, we test whether E can significantly modify this GRS effect. This two-stage procedure can not only provide a p-value for a G Ã— E test but also guide inferences on how E modifies the adverse effect of a gene. With systematic simulations, we compared several ways to construct a GRS. If E exacerbates the adverse influence of a gene, GRS formed by the elastic net (ENET) or the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) is recommended. However, the performance of ENET or LASSO will be compromised if E attenuates the adverse influence of a gene, and using the ridge regression (RIDGE) can be more powerful in this situation. Applying RIDGE to 18,424 subjects in the Taiwan Biobank, we showed that performing regular exercise can attenuate the adverse influence of the FTO gene on four obesity measures: BMI (p = 0.0009), body fat percentage (p = 0.0031), waist circumference (p = 0.0052), and hip circumference (p = 0.0001). As another example, we used RIDGE and found the FGF5 gene has a stronger effect on blood pressure in Han Chinese with a higher waist-to-hip ratio [p = 0.0013 for diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and p = 0.0027 for systolic blood pressure (SBP)]. This study provides an evaluation on the GRS approaches, which is important to infer whether E attenuates or exacerbates the adverse influence of a candidate gene.",2020,
Testing for defensive synergy in Caribbean sponges : Bad taste or glass spicules?,"Abstract Chemical and physical defenses of sessile organisms against consumers are well described for both terrestrial and marine systems. However, previous studies have focused on chemical or physical defenses in isolation, and have not considered their interaction. Marine sponges provide a model system for testing this interaction. Some sponge species produce secondary metabolites that deter predation; they may also contain siliceous spicules, but previous studies have provided little evidence that spicules in isolation offer any defense against generalist fish predators. To determine whether the two components have an additive, antagonistic, or synergistic interaction, crude organic extracts and spicules from individuals of 8 Caribbean sponge species were isolated and tested in laboratory feeding assays. These included one chemically defended reef sponge ( Agelas clathrodes ) and seven known to be intermediately deterrent: six from reef habitats ( Cinachyrella alloclada , Clathria virgultosa , Cribrochalina infundibulum , Niphates digitalis , Svenzea zeai , and Xestospongia muta ) and one from mangrove habitats ( Tedania ignis ). Extracts and spicules were assayed at various concentrations, both individually and in combination, in laboratory feeding assays with the bluehead wrasse, Thalassoma bifasciatum . A SAS based GENMOD procedure based on an isobolographic analysis model was used for statistical comparisons. Four sponges ( A. clathrodes , C. alloclada , C. virgultosa , and one of three individuals of X. muta ) showed evidence of synergisms. Of these, synergy in C. alloclada , C. virgultosa , and X. muta was caused by approximately natural concentrations of extracts and spicules. The extract of A . clathrodes was deterrent, but combination assays required nearly a 3-fold reduction in extract concentration and an 8-fold increase in spicule concentration to show the synergistic effect. Contrary to previous findings, spicules from C. infundibulum and two of three individuals of X. muta were deterrent at natural concentrations. Sponge spicules may be defensive in isolation, or may enhance chemical defenses against consumers, but the lack of synergisms for individuals in 4 of 7 species with intermediate levels of chemical defense suggests that defensive synergy is not the general rule and, when present, may be an example of an exaptation.",2005,Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology

An Evaluation of Prior Residency and Habitat Effects on the Persistence of Settling Reef Fishes,"Both habitat complexity and competitive interactions can shape patterns of distribution and abundance of species. I evaluated the separate and joint effects of competitive interactions and habitat complexity on the survival of young fishes (Family Labridae) on coral reefs. First, I developed (in Chapter 2) a quantitative approach to evaluate potential resource (i.e., niche) overlap among groups of co-occurring species. Using appropriate transformations and probability models, I show that different types of data (e.g., categorical, continuous, count or binary data, as well as electivity scores) give rise to a standard measure of niche overlap, with the overlap statistic between two species defined as the overlapping area between the distributions for each species. Measurements derived from different types of data can be combined into a single multivariate analysis of niche overlap by averaging over multiple axes. I then describe null model permutation tests that differentiate between species occupying similar and different niches within my unified indices. I then implemented this approach (in Chapter 3) to evaluate potential habitat overlap among eight species of wrasse (Gomphosus varius, Halichoeres hortulanus, H. trimaculatus, Pseudocheilinus hexataenia, Scarus sordidus, Stethojulis bandanensis, Thalassoma hardwicke and T. quinquevittatum), and used these results to inform my subsequent field experiments. In a field assay, I identified the presence of T. quinquevittatum as having the greatest negative effect on survival of transplanted T. hardwicke from a suite of three candidate species which were most similar in habitat use to T. hardwicke (the other two candidate species were G. varius and P. hexataenia). In a subsequent field experiment, I tested how competition with T. quinquevittatum and structural refuge interact to influence the postsettlement survival of T. hardwicke. Competition with T. quinquevittatum and structural refuge both altered the survival of T. hardwicke, although their effects were not interactive, indicating that structural complexity did not mitigate the negative effects of competition. Survival of T. hardwicke was 2.3 times greater in treatments without T. quinquevittatum relative to those with T. quinquevittatum, and 2.8 times greater in treatments with structural refuge relative to treatments without structural refuge. Thalassoma hardwicke and T. quinquevittatum often enter reef communities asynchronously, resulting in competitive pressures faced by earlyarriving individuals that potentially differ from those experienced by late-arriving individuals. In a series of field experiments, I investigated whether the strength of intra-cohort competitive interactions between recent T. hardwicke and T. quinquevittatum settlers were dependent upon the sequence and temporal separation of their arrival into communities. Survival rates for both species were greatest in the absence of competitors, but when competitors were present, survival rates were maximized when competitors arrived simultaneously. Survival rates declined as each species entered the community progressively later than its competitor. Further, reversals in the sequence of arrival reversed competitive outcomes. Results provide empirical evidence for competitive lotteries in the maintenance of species diversity in demographically open marine systems, while also highlighting the importance of temporal variation in the direction and magnitude of interaction strengths. To further our understanding of how timing of arrival influences interaction strengths, I tested whether increasing the availability of complex habitat attenuates or enhances timing-of-arrival effects. Results from this field experiment indicated that aggression by early-arriving individuals towards late-arriving individuals increased as arrival times diverged. When aggression was weak, subordinate individuals were not displaced from complex habitat. Experimental increases in the availability of complex habitat resulted in increased survival of subordinates, presumably by disrupting predation pressure. However, when aggression was intense, competitive subordinates were displaced from complex habitat (regardless of the amount of complex habitat available), and this likely increased their exposure to predators. Overall, the experimental and observational components of this thesis emphasise heterogeneity in competitive environments experienced by recently settled reef fishes. These results highlight the important role that priority effects and habitat complexity play in determining the persistence of reef fish settlers, and illustrate how ecological contexts can add considerable variation to realised interaction strengths.",2010,
Structure and Hydrocarbon Potential of Sedimentary Basins of the Far East Marginal Seas: ABSTRACT,"Crustal structural of the Bering, Okhotsk Japan, East China, and South China marginal seas consists of continental plates and deep sea basins that are the elements of the lowermost order in the structure of transition zone from the Asia continent to the Pacific Ocean. Two stages are recognized in the crustal evolution of the northwest Pacific transition zone: (1) geosyncline development that began in the pre-Paleozoic and continues to the present within island arcs; and (2) quasiplatform stage that began in the late Cretaceous and continues to the Holocene within shelf plates. The continental margins of the Far East seas consist of Cenozoic terrigenous cover and pre-Cenozoic basement composed of geosyncline rock association. Normal faults control graben features in the basement and develop rift systems. Paleogene subcontinental formations make up the lowermost section of the cover. A major Oligocene-Holocene sequence (marine formations) overlies and smooths rough topography of the basement and creates giant sedimentary basins. Sediment thickness of the basins attains 10 km. Tectonic evolution of the marginal seas implies the shelf plates to be young platforms and deep-sea basins are believed to be parts of the Pacific thalassocraton fenced by island arcs. The tectonic criterion enables us to differmoreÂ Â» and grade the provinces according to a hydrocarbon potential. Nearly 100 promising sedimentary basins are presently known in the Bering, Okhotst Japan, East China, and South China seas. About ten basins have been identified as hydrocarbon resources. Deep-sea basins also look promising for hydrocarbons. All the economically significant hydrocarbon accumulations in the Far East marginal seas are attributed to the Cenozoic sediment cover. Major resources are concentrated in the Miocene and Pliocene terrigenous sequences composed of progradation facies within the shelf plates.Â«Â less",1990,AAPG Bulletin

Efficient Dimensionality Reduction for High-Dimensional Network Estimation,"We propose module graphical lasso (MGL), an aggressive dimensionality reduction and network estimation technique for a high-dimensional Gaussian graphical model (GGM). MGL achieves scalability, interpretability and robustness by exploiting the modularity property of many real-world networks. Variables are organized into tightly coupled modules and a graph structure is estimated to determine the conditional independencies among modules. MGL iteratively learns the module assignment of variables, the latent variables, each corresponding to a module, and the parameters of the GGM of the latent variables. In synthetic data experiments, MGL outperforms the standard graphical lasso and three other methods that incorporate latent variables into GGMs. When applied to gene expression data from ovarian cancer, MGL outperforms standard clustering algorithms in identifying functionally coherent gene sets and predicting survival time of patients. The learned modules and their dependencies provide novel insights into cancer biology as well as identifying possible novel drug targets.",2014,
Variable Selection for High Dimensional Multivariate Outcomes.,"We consider variable selection for high-dimensional multivariate regression using penalized likelihoods when the number of outcomes and the number of covariates might be large. To account for within-subject correlation, we consider variable selection when a working precision matrix is used and when the precision matrix is jointly estimated using a two-stage procedure. We show that under suitable regularity conditions, penalized regression coefficient estimators are consistent for model selection for an arbitrary working precision matrix, and have the oracle properties and are efficient when the true precision matrix is used or when it is consistently estimated using sparse regression. We develop an efficient computation procedure for estimating regression coefficients using the coordinate descent algorithm in conjunction with sparse precision matrix estimation using the graphical LASSO (GLASSO) algorithm. We develop the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) for estimating the tuning parameter and show that BIC is consistent for model selection. We evaluate finite sample performance for the proposed method using simulation studies and illustrate its application using the type II diabetes gene expression pathway data.",2014,Statistica Sinica
"Computational Sufficiency, Reflection Groups, and Generalized Lasso Penalties","We study estimators with generalized lasso penalties within the computational sufficiency framework introduced by Vu (2018, arXiv:1807.05985). By representing these penalties as support functions of zonotopes and more generally Minkowski sums of line segments and rays, we show that there is a natural reflection group associated with the underlying optimization problem. A consequence of this point of view is that for large classes of estimators sharing the same penalty, the penalized least squares estimator is computationally minimal sufficient. This means that all such estimators can be computed by refining the output of any algorithm for the least squares case. An interesting technical component is our analysis of coordinate descent on the dual problem. A key insight is that the iterates are obtained by reflecting and averaging, so they converge to an element of the dual feasible set that is minimal with respect to a ordering induced by the group associated with the penalty. Our main application is fused lasso/total variation denoising and isotonic regression on arbitrary graphs. In those cases the associated group is a permutation group.",2018,arXiv: Statistics Theory
Piecewise isometry and substitutive language,"In this talk we will present a class of piecewise isometries, where the symbolic dynamics can be described in terms of substitutions. This result is a generalisation of the results of [6]. Introduction We study an example of a piecewise isometry introduced in [3] by Boshernitzan and Goetz, this map is called a piecewise rotation. Actually it is the piecewise isometry which has been the most studied, see [6] and [5]. Consider a line in the plane, two points outside the line and an angle. The map is locally defined on each half plane (defined by the line) by a rotation of the fixed angle centered in one of the two points. The phase space of the map can be described with two real parameters: one for the angle and one which measure the relative position of the centers. If the centers are centrally symmetric through the origin, then this parameter is null and the map is called symmetric. Thus the map can always been written in the following form T : Câ†’ C T (z) = { e2iÏ€Î¸(z + Ïƒ + 1) Imz > 0 e2iÏ€Î¸(z + Ïƒ âˆ’ 1) Imz < 0 where Ïƒ is a real number. The parameter Î¸ is called the angle of the map by abuse of notation. Among the positions of the centers of rotations this map can be bijective, non injective, non surjective. In [3] Boshernitzan and Goetz show that in the two last cases the map is either globally attractive or globally repulsive. In the bijective case, Goetz and Quas showed that for a rational angle Î¸ every orbit is bounded, see [6]. In order to prove this result they introduce a symbolic study of this map associated to the coding according to the two half-planes. They define the notion of rotationally coded points, which represent points which have the same symbolic coding as points under the action of a rotation of the fixed angle, centered at the origin. This notion is very useful to find periodic orbits, but it only works for maps closed to the symmetric ones. In the irrational case Goetz, Quas and Cheung are able to give precise bounds on the density of periodic orbits, see [5]. Remark that a similar map has also been studied in [1]. Results of the paper: Here we want to give a precise description of the symbolic dynamics. We do not want to restrict to bijective cases or to symmetric cases inside the bijective case. Nevertheless we restrict our study to a finite family of angles { 4 , 1 3 , 1 6 , 1 5 , 1 8 }. For the cases 2Ï€ 5 , Ï€ 4 we find some bounded orbits which are not periodic. Thus these orbits does not come from rotationally coded orbits. âˆ—Aix Marseille UniversitÃ©, CNRS, Centrale Marseille, I2M, UMR 7373, 13453 Marseille, France.

Email: ikaborei@yahoo.fr Words, substitutions: Our description of the symbolic dynamics is made in terms of substitutions. A substitution Ïƒ is an application from an alphabet A to the set Aâˆ— \{Îµ} of nonempty finite words on A. It extends to a morphism of Aâˆ— by concatenation, that is Ïƒ(uv) = Ïƒ(u)Ïƒ(v). Let S be a finite set of substitutions and X a finite set of words. A substitutive language (or S adic system) is a language where every word is a factor of a word obtained by composition of several substitutions of S applied to a word of X. This class of words has been studied in combinatorics of words, see for example [7] and [2]. Here we give an example of a geometric dynamical system which has a symbolic description in term of a substitutive language. Theorem 1 The symbolic dynamics of a piecewise rotation has the following properties: â€¢ If Î¸ âˆˆ { 4 , 1 3 , 1 6}, every orbit is periodic. â€¢ If Î¸ âˆˆ {15 , 1 8}, every orbit is bounded but some are non periodic. â€¢ For non symmetric cases, the dynamics is the same for all values of a rational number Ïƒ âˆˆ (0, 1). In all the cases the language is substitutive. In the figures we show some pictures of the dynamic of this map for different values of the parameters.

"Toward the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) Rehabilitation Set: A Minimal Generic Set of Domains for Rehabilitation as a Health Strategy.","OBJECTIVE
To develop a comprehensive set of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) categories as a minimal standard for reporting and assessing functioning and disability in clinical populations along the continuum of care. The specific aims were to specify the domains of functioning recommended for an ICF Rehabilitation Set and to identify a minimal set of environmental factors (EFs) to be used alongside the ICF Rehabilitation Set when describing disability across individuals and populations with various health conditions.


DESIGN
Secondary analysis of existing data sets using regression methods (Random Forests and Group Lasso regression) and expert consultations.


SETTING
Along the continuum of care, including acute, early postacute, and long-term and community rehabilitation settings.


PARTICIPANTS
Persons (N=9863) with various health conditions participated in primary studies. The number of respondents for whom the dependent variable data were available and used in this analysis wasÂ 9264.


INTERVENTIONS
Not applicable.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
For regression analyses, self-reported general health was used as a dependent variable. The ICF categories from the functioning component and the EF component were used as independent variables for the development of the ICF Rehabilitation Set and the minimal set of EFs, respectively.


RESULTS
Thirty ICF categories to be complemented with 12 EFs were identified as relevant to the identified ICF sets. The ICF Rehabilitation Set constitutes of 9 ICF categories from the component body functions and 21 from the component activities and participation. The minimal set of EFs contains 12 categories spanning all chapters of the EF component of the ICF.


CONCLUSIONS

Reed Muller Sensing Matrices and the LASSO - (Invited Paper),"We construct two families of deterministic sensing matrices where the columns are obtained by exponentiating codewords in the quaternary Delsarte-Goethals code DG(m, r). This method of construction results in sensing matrices with low coherence and spectral norm. The first family, which we call Delsarte-Goethals frames, are 2m - dimensional tight frames with redundancy 2rm. The second family, which we call Delsarte-Goethals sieves, are obtained by subsampling the column vectors in a Delsarte-Goethals frame. Different rows of a Delsarte-Goethals sieve may not be orthogonal, and we present an effective algorithm for identifying all pairs of non-orthogonal rows. The pairs turn out to be duplicate measurements and eliminating them leads to a tight frame. Experimental results suggest that all DG(m, r) sieves with m â‰¤ 15 and r â‰¥ 2 are tight-frames; there are no duplicate rows. For both families of sensing matrices, we measure accuracy of reconstruction (statistical 0-1 loss) and complexity (average reconstruction time) as a function of the sparsity level k. Our results show that DG frames and sieves outperform random Gaussian matrices in terms of noiseless and noisy signal recovery using the LASSO.",2010,

Search for early pancreatic cancer blood biomarkers in five European prospective population biobanks using metabolomics,"Background and aim Most patients with pancreatic cancer present with advanced disease and die within the first year after diagnosis. Predictive biomarkers that signal the presence of pancreatic cancer in an early stage are desperately needed. We aimed to identify new and validate previously found plasma metabolomic biomarkers associated with early stages of pancreatic cancer. Methods The low incidence rate complicates prospective biomarker studies. Here, we took advantage of the availability of biobanked samples from five large population cohorts (HUNT2, HUNT3, FINRISK, Estonian biobank, Rotterdam Study) and identified prediagnostic blood samples from individuals who were to receive a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer between one month and seventeen years after blood sampling, and compared these with age- and gender-matched controls from the same cohorts. We applied 1H-NMR-based metabolomics on the Nightingale platform on these samples and applied logistic regression to assess the predictive value of individual metabolite concentrations, with gender, age, body mass index, smoking status, type 2 diabetes mellitus status, fasting status, and cohort as covariates. Results After quality assessment, we retained 356 cases and 887 controls. We identified two interesting hits, glutamine (p=0.011) and histidine (p=0.012), and obtained Westfall-Young family-wise error rate adjusted p-values of 0.43 for both. Stratification in quintiles showed a 1.5x elevated risk for the lowest 20% of glutamine and a 2.2x increased risk for the lowest 20% of histidine. Stratification by time to diagnosis (<2 years, 2-5 years, >5 years) suggested glutamine to be involved in an earlier process, tapering out closer to onset, and histidine in a process closer to the actual onset. Lasso-penalized logistic regression showed a slight improvement of the area under the Receiver Operator Curves when including glutamine and histidine in the model. Finally, our data did not support the earlier identified branched-chain amino acids as potential biomarkers for pancreatic cancer in several American cohorts. Conclusion While identifying glutamine and histidine as early biomarkers of potential biological interest, our results imply that a study at this scale does not yield metabolomic biomarkers with sufficient predictive value to be clinically useful per se as prognostic biomarkers.",2019,bioRxiv
Regularized Regression Incorporating Network Information: Simultaneous Estimation of Covariate Coefficients and Connection Signs,"We develop an algorithm that incorporates network information into regression settings. It simultaneously estimates the covariate coefficients and the signs of the network connections (i.e. whether the connections are of an activating or of a repressing type). For the coefficient estimation steps an additional penalty is set on top of the lasso penalty, similarly to Li and Li (2008). We develop a fast implementation for the new method based on coordinate descent. Furthermore, we show how the new methods can be applied to time-to-event data. The new method yields good results in simulation studies concerning sensitivity and specificity of non-zero covariate coefficients, estimation of network connection signs, and prediction performance. We also apply the new method to two microarray time-to-event data sets from patients with ovarian cancer and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The new method performs very well in both cases. The main application of this new method is of biomedical nature, but it may also be useful in other fields where network data is available.",2014,
"Etablierung einer Multiplex Real-Time PCR zum Nachweis der Escherichia coli-Serogruppen O26, O103, O111, O145 und O157","Enterohamorrhagische E. coli (EHEC) gehoren zu den wichtigen, lebensmittelassoziierten Erregern von Gastroenteritiden. Schwere Erkrankungsverlaufe, wie die postinfektiose Komplikation HUS sind bekannt und betreffen meist Kinder unter 5 Lebensjahren. Als Primarquelle gelten Wiederkauer, in deren Gastrointestinaltrakt das naturliche Habitat von Shigatoxin-bildenden E. coli liegt. Uber fakale Kontamination von Lebensmitteln, Wasser oder auch direkten Kontakt konnen STEC oral vom Menschen aufgenommen werden, wobei nicht alle STEC gleich virulent sind. Manche, wie z. B. die der Serogruppen O26, O103, O111, O145 und O157 werden wesentlich haufiger bei erkrankten Menschen nachgewiesen als andere. 
Ziel dieser Studie war es zum einen funf Singleplex Real-Time PCR-Systeme und ein Pentaplex Real-Time PCR-System zum Nachweis der oben genannten funf E. coli-Serogruppen am LGL, Oberschleisheim, zu etablieren. Die in der Norm ISO/TS 13136:2012 als â€žhochpathogenâ€œ eingestuften STEC-Stamme konnen somit anhand der dort beschriebenen Primer- und Sondensequenzen aus Probenisolaten detektiert werden. Fur die Validierung wurden die Selektivitat, Sensitivitat, Prazision und Richtigkeit der PCR-Systeme bestimmt. Zum anderen wurden die Daten von 8272 humanen Proben (einschlieslich der des EHEC O104:H4-Ausbruchs von 2011), 1521 Lebensmittelproben, 240 Tierkotproben, 69 Schlachtkorperproben und 29 Wasserproben aus den Jahren 2009 bis 2011 aus Bayern sowie die STEC-Serotypisierungsergebnisse von 09/2004 bis 12/2011 ausgewertet und beschrieben. 
Im Vergleich mit der gangigen Serotypisierung mittels Agglutination bietet das Real-Time PCR-Verfahren insbesondere bei grosem Probenumfang einen enormen Zeitvorteil. Das Pentaplex PCR-System ermoglicht zudem eine zeitgleiche Analyse von Probenisolaten auf alle funf Serogruppen. Alle E. coli-Stamme der Serogruppen O26, O103, O111, O145 und O157 wurden durch die PCR-Systeme korrekt nachgewiesen. 
Die O103-Sondensequenz wurde hierfur zuvor modifiziert. Die Spezifitat der Nachweissysteme fur O26, O103 und O145 lag in Bezug auf E. coli bei 100 %. Bei den Nachweissystemen fur O111 und O157 zeigten auch Bakterienstamme anderer Gattungen ein positives Ergebnis in der PCR (Serratia entomophila / rfbEO157-positiv und Shigella sp. LGL 2869 / wbd1O111-positiv). 
Die Datenauswertung ergab unter anderem einen hohen Anteil stx-positiver Tierkot- und Schlachtkorperproben von Rindern. Die meisten stx-positiven Lebensmittel stammten von Wiederkauern. Vereinzelt waren auch potenziell humanvirulente STEC nachzuweisen. Der Grosteil der nicht-humanen Proben war weder eae- noch EhlyA-positiv, wahrend nur ein Viertel der humanen Proben keines der beiden Gene aufwies. Bei humanen Proben dominiert die Gruppe der unter 1 bis 5-jahrigen Erkrankten und Frauen sind haufiger betroffen als Manner. Die E. coli-Serogruppen O26, O103, O111, O145 und O157 gehoren zu den haufigsten in Bayern und 2011 infizierten sich 47 Menschen in Bayern mit EHEC O104:H4.",2013,

Recent update on COVID-19 in India: Is locking down the country enough?,"Abstract Background: India is the second-largest population in the world, and it is not well equipped, hitherto, in the scenario of the global pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 could impart a devastating impact on the Indian population. Only way to respond against this critical condition is by practicing large-scale social distancing. India lock down for 21 days, however, till 7 April 2020, SARS-CoV-2 positive cases were growing exponentially, which raises the concerns if the number of reported and actual cases are similar. Methods: We use Lasso Regression with Î±=0.12 and Polynomial features of degree 2 to predict the growth factor. Also, we predicted Logistic curve using the Prophet Python. Further, using the growth rate to logistic, and carrying capacity is 20000 allowed us to calculate the maximum cases and new cases per day. Results: We found the predicted growth factor with a standard deviation of 0.3443 for the upcoming days. When the growth factor becomes 1.0, which is known as Inflection point, it will be safe to state that the rate is no longer exponential. The estimated time to reach the inflection point is between 15-20 April. At that time, the estimated number of total positive cases will be over 12500, if lockdown remains continue. Conclusions: Our analysis suggests that there is an urgent need to take action to extend the period of lockdown and allocate enough resources, including personnel, beds, and intensive care facilities, to manage the situation in the next few days and weeks. Otherwise, the outbreak in India can reach the level of the USA or Italy or could be worse than these countries within a few days or weeks, given the size of the population and lack of resources.",2020,medRxiv
Exploring the diversity of urban and peri-urban agricultural systems in Sudano-Sahelian West Africa: An attempt towards a regional typology,"Developing appropriate and innovative technologies and policies to respond to the challenges that urban and peri-urban agriculture (UPA) faces in West Africa requires a better understanding of the existing production systems. Although there is an increasing recognition of the importance of UPA in the region, its extent, forms and related practices may vary across countries and cities because of different socio-economic conditions and urbanization patterns. A systematic classification of the regional UPA systems is lacking but is necessary to allow for meaningful comparisons between cities and avoid misleading generalizations. The purpose of this study was to develop a typology of UPA households across three selected West African cities. Survey data from 318 UPA households (Kano: 99, Bobo Dioulasso: 111, Sikasso: 108) were submitted to principal components analysis for categorical variables (CATPCA). Next, the Two-Step cluster method was used to classify the households using object scores obtained from the CATPCA. Diversification of farm activities, farm resource endowment and production orientation were the major discriminating variables. In each city, four distinct UPA systems were identified, of which three were common to Kano, Bobo Dioulasso and Sikasso: commercial gardening plus field crops and livestock (59%, 18%, and 37%), commercial livestock plus subsistence field cropping (14%, 41%, and 7%), and commercial gardening plus semi-commercial field cropping (14%, 28%, and 30%). The fourth group was different at each location and was characterized as follows: commercial gardening plus semi-commercial livestock in Kano (13%), commercial field cropping in Bobo Dioulasso (13%) and commercial gardening in Sikasso (26%).",2011,Landscape and Urban Planning
Description of two free-living nematode species of Halomonhystera disjuncta complex (Nematoda: Monhysterida) from two peculiar habitats in the sea,"Abstract
Morphological descriptions of two Halomonhystera species (Nematoda, Monhysterida) are presented (Halomonhystera hermesi and Halomonhystera socialis). Halomonhystera hermesi sp. n. occurs in a dense monospecific and homogeneous population on bacterial mats in the HÃ¥kon Mosby mud volcano in the Barents Sea at a depth of 1,280Â m. The species is an endemic lineage distinctly separated from other shallow-water cryptotaxa of the Halomonhystera disjucta species complex on the base of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase subunit I (genetic divergence 19.6â€“23.8Â %) and nuclear genetic markers, and on the base of morphometrics by Van Campenhout et al. (2014). H. socialis (BÃ¼tschli 1874) is redescribed on the basis of White Sea specimens. This species dwells in mass on the detached kelp accumulation in the upper sublittoral. H. socialis is differentiated from other species of the Halomonhystera disjuncta complex morphometrically by a larger body size and by genetic divergence in nuclear markers. The genus Halomonhystera AndrÃ¡ssy 2006 is redefined, and its morphospecies list is reviewed. Species H. bathislandica (Riemann 1995) comb. n., H. fisheri (Zekely et al. 2006) comb. n., H. islandica (De Coninck 1943) comb. n. and H. vandoverae (Zekely et al. 2006) comb. n. are transferred to Halomonhystera from Thalassomonhystera; H. paradisjuncta (de Coninck 1943) comb. n., H. rotundicapitata (Filipjev 1922) comb. n. and H. taurica (Tsalolikhin 2007) comb. n. transferred to Halomonhystera from Geomonhystera. Halomonhystera ambiguoides (BÃ¼tschli 1874) is considered as species inquirenda because of incompleteness of its diagnosis.",2014,Helgoland Marine Research

"Relationship between Clinical Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Symptoms and Indexes of Blood, Renal Function, Liver Function and Immunology","Objective: This paper aimed to study the relationships between clinical systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) symptoms and indexes of blood, renal function, liver function and immunology. Methods: Total 117 SLE patients were collected, and clinical symptoms and biochemical indexes of blood, renal function, liver function and immunology were determined. Then, adaptive lasso analysis was used to analyse the potential relationship between the clinical symptoms of SLE and biochemical indexes. Results: The present results indicated that pleurisy is closely related to the red blood cells (RBC), haemoglobin (Hb) and urea nitrogen (BUN) with the |Î²j | values of 0.0045, 0.0168 and 0.0064, respectively; oedema is closely related to the albuminuria and cylindruria with |Î²j | values of 0.0198 and 0.1170; alopecia has closely correlations with liver damage and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), (|Î²j | values were 0.0033 and 0.0104); fever is correlated to liver damage (|Î²j | values were 0.0011); raynaud phenomenon is closely correlated to the triglycerides (TG) and Anti-U1 Ribonucleoprotein (u1RNP) with |Î²j | value of 0.0012 and 0.0012; facial redness and arthralgia have close correlations with SSA (|Î²j | value were 0.3580 and 0.0047; arthritis and pericarditis are closely related to antinucleosome antivodies (AnuA) with |Î²j | values of 0.0038 and 0.0026. Conclusion: The present study indicated that some biochemical, including RBC, Hb, BUN, albuminuria and cylindruria, liver damage, AST, TG, SSA, AnuA and u1RNP, are closely to the prognosis of SLE and itâ€™s important to control these biochemical indexes during the treatment period.",2017,West Indian Medical Journal
"CT derived radiomic score for predicting the added benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy following surgery in Stage I, II resectable Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: a retrospective multi-cohort study for outcome prediction.","Summary



Background
Development and validation of a quantitative radiomic risk score (QuRiS) and associated nomogram (QuRNom) for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (ES-NSCLC) that is prognostic of disease-free survival (DFS) and predictive of the added benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) following surgery.


Methods
QuRiS was developed using radiomic texture features derived from within and outside the primary lung nodule on chest CT scans using a cohort D1 of 329 patients from the Cleveland Clinic. A LASSO-Cox regularization model was used for data dimension reduction, feature selection, and QuRiS construction. QuRiS was independently validated on D2(N=114; University of Pennsylvania) and D3(N=82; TCIA). QuRNom was constructed by integrating QuRiS with T-, N-Descriptors, and LVI. The added benefit of ACT using QuRiS and QuRNom was validated by comparing patients who received ACT against patients who underwent surgery alone in D1-D3. To explore the underlying morphologic basis of the QuRiS, we explored associations with corresponding whole-slide tissue scans (WSIs) and mRNA sequencing data using subsets of D1 and D3.


Findings
QuRiS consisted three intra- and ten peri-tumoral CT-radiomic features and was found to be significantly associated with DFS (D1: HR=1.60 [1.10-2.20];p<Â·05; D2:HR=2.70 [1.40-5.10]; p<Â·01; D3:HR=2.70 [1.20-5.70];p<Â·01). Patients were partitioned into three risk groups (QH, QI, QL) based off their corresponding QuRiS score. High QuRiS group, QH, patients were observed to have significantly prolonged survival with ACT when compared to surgery alone (D1: HR=0Â·27[0.07-0.95],p<0.05; D2+D3: HR=0Â·08[0.01-0.42],p<0.01). For developed QuRNom, the actual efficacy of ACT was predictive of nomogram-estimated survival benefit (D1: HR= D1:0Â·25 [0Â·12-0Â·55], D3: HR=0Â·13 [0Â·004-0Â·99]). QuRiS features were found to be associated with the spatial arrangement of TILs and cancer nuclei on corresponding WSIs (D1: Rho=0Â·23,p<0Â·05, N=70). They were also observed to have an association with biological pathways implicated in chemotaxis (D3,p<0Â·05, N=86) and other immune specific biological pathways.


Interpretation
QuRiS and QuRNom were validated as being prognostic of DFS and predictive of the added benefit of ACT.",2020,The Lancet. Digital health
"Local Technology and Shifting Sociopolitics: A Hunter-Gatherer Case Study on Santa Cruz Island, northern Channel Islands, California","Author(s): Sunell, Scott David | Advisor(s): Arnold, Jeanne E | Abstract: One of the central and ongoing efforts of contemporary archaeology lies in identifying explanatory mechanisms for change through time in human societies. Details of the pace, impetus, material culture correlates, and sociopolitical context for these changes are often hotly debated. For researchers studying Chumash society of the Santa Barbara Channel region, the archaeological record provides a basis for understanding these dynamics through time, reflected in both settlement systems and labor organization (Arnold 2001a; Perry and Glassow 2015). I analyze Laguna Canyon, a major drainage located on the south side of Santa Cruz Island in the Santa Barbara Channel, where evidence of resource use during the late Middle period (600-1150AD) reveals a locally focused trajectory of residential tool manufacture, reflecting a nuanced response to contemporary sociopolitical change. Two patterns emerged during this work. First, Laguna was most intensively occupied during the late Middle period with ten sites dating to that span. By contrast, during the Transitional period (1150-1300 A.D.) use of the canyon focused on a single site. The pattern in Laguna is like that of canyons with large permanent villages (Arnold 2001b, Peterson 1994; Perry and Glassow 2015). Second, the occupants of Laguna made microliths from local igneous materials during the late Middle period but imported formal chert microtools during the Transitional period. Locally-oriented systems of occupation and production in the late Middle period were supplanted by regional ones during the Transitional period. In this assemblage I identify change through time that suggests a nuanced process of accommodation with both intra-island and regional dynamics, inflected by cultural preferences in lithic procurement and a continuing emphasis on local raw materials that makes the record of Laguna Canyon an important source of data for understanding change through time in Chumash society and among complex hunter-gatherers generally.",2018,
DNNAce: Prediction of prokaryote lysine acetylation sites through deep neural networks with multi-information fusion,"Abstract As a reversible and widely existing post-translational modification of proteins, acetylation plays a crucial role in transcriptional regulation, apoptosis, and cytokine signaling. To better understand the molecular mechanism of acetylation, identification of acetylation sites is vital. The traditional experimental methods are time-consuming and cost-prohibitive, and the majority of acetylation sites remain unknown. It is necessary to develpoe an effective and accurate computational approach to predict the acetylation sites, especially utilizing the advanced deep learning technique. In this study, we propose a prokaryote acetylation sites prediction method based on the deep neural networks, named DNNAce. We extract the protein features from sequence information, physicochemical information, and evolution information of amino acid residues and obtain the initial feature set All. Moreover, we use Group Lasso to remove the irrelevant features that are not effective for classification in the sites prediction area. Compared to other machine learning methods, we use deep neural networks to predict acetylation sites. The 10-fold cross-validation on independent test datasets indicates that DNNAce has the highest values of accuracy for predicting acetylation sites. That DNNAce accurately identifies acetylation sites assists us in understanding its molecular mechanism, and provides related theoretical foundation for the development of drug targets for various diseases.

Screen and clean: a tool for identifying interactions in genome-wide association studies.,"Epistasis could be an important source of risk for disease. How interacting loci might be discovered is an open question for genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Most researchers limit their statistical analyses to testing individual pairwise interactions (i.e., marginal tests for association). A more effective means of identifying important predictors is to fit models that include many predictors simultaneously (i.e., higher-dimensional models). We explore a procedure called screen and clean (SC) for identifying liability loci, including interactions, by using the lasso procedure, which is a model selection tool for high-dimensional regression. We approach the problem by using a varying dictionary consisting of terms to include in the model. In the first step the lasso dictionary includes only main effects. The most promising single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are identified using a screening procedure. Next the lasso dictionary is adjusted to include these main effects and the corresponding interaction terms. Again, promising terms are identified using lasso screening. Then significant terms are identified through the cleaning process. Implementation of SC for GWAS requires algorithms to explore the complex model space induced by the many SNPs genotyped and their interactions. We propose and explore a set of algorithms and find that SC successfully controls Type I error while yielding good power to identify risk loci and their interactions. When the method is applied to data obtained from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium study of Type 1 Diabetes it uncovers evidence supporting interaction within the HLA class II region as well as within Chromosome 12q24.",2010,Genetic epidemiology
International Comparison of Analytical Methods of Determining the Soil Organic Matter Content of Lithuanian Eutric Albeluvisols,"Abstract Several soil organic matter (SOM) methodologies have been employed to analyze a suite of subsampled soils, and their results have been correlated. This will permit future comparison of the large archive of SOM databases, which widely exist in Lithuania and other Central and Eastern European countries, with those of other international countries. Samples were collected (n=92) from topsoil and subsoil horizons of Eutric Glassoboralfs (Eutric Albeluvisols) at five longâ€term monitoring sites (three sites with 8 years' duration and two sites with 20 years' duration) containing a total of 46 experimental field plots. Each soil sample was subsampled and SOM determined by several analytical approaches (namely, dry combustion, Walkleyâ€“Black, Tyurin photometric, Tyurin titrimetric, and lossâ€onâ€ignition methods). Correlation coefficients between multiple sets of results varied between r=0.831 and r=0.965 (n=92, P<0.001). Based on the strength and significance of these relationships, we propose that simple linear regression equations can be confidently employed to recalculate SOM data among various analytical methodologies and thus help resolve the issue of international data comparison.",2006,Communications in Soil Science and Plant Analysis
Conservation and diversity in expression of candidate genes regulating socially-induced female-male sex change in wrasses,"Fishes exhibit remarkably diverse, and plastic, patterns of sexual development, most striking ofwhich is sequential hermaphroditism,where individuals readily reverse sex in adulthood. How this stunning example of phenotypic plasticity is controlled at a genetic level remains poorly understood. Several genes have been implicated in regulating sex change, yet the degree to which a conserved genetic machinery orchestrates this process has not yet been addressed. Using captive and in-the-field social manipulations to initiate sex change, combined with a comparative qPCR approach, we compared expression patterns of four candidate regulatory genes among three species of wrasses (Labridae)â€”a large and diverse teleost family where female-to-male sex change is pervasive, socially-cued, and likely ancestral. Expression in brain and gonadal tissues were compared among the iconic tropical bluehead wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum) and the temperate spotty (Notolabrus celidotus) and kyusen (Parajulus poecilepterus) wrasses. In all three species, gonadal sex change was preceded by downregulation of cyp19a1a (encoding gonadal aromatase that converts androgens to oestrogens) and accompanied by upregulation of amh (encoding anti-mÃ¼llerian hormone that primarily regulates male germ cell development), and these genes may act concurrently to orchestrate ovary-testis transformation. In the brain, our data argue against a role for brain aromatase (cyp19a1b) in initiating behavioural sex change, as its expression trailed behavioural changes. However, we find that isotocin (it, that regulates teleost socio-sexual behaviours) expression correlatedwith dominantmale-specific behaviours in the bluehead wrasse, suggesting it upregulation mediates the rapid behavioural sex change characteristic of blueheads and other tropical wrasses. However, it expression was not sex-biased in temperate spotty and kyusen wrasses, where sex change is more protracted and social groups may be less tightly-structured. Together, these findings How to cite this article Thomas JT, Todd EV, Muncaster S, Lokman PM, Damsteegt EL, Liu H, Soyano K, GlÃ©onnec F, LammMS, Godwin JR, Gemmell NJ. 2019.

Rationale for Moral Education: A Reading in Platoâ€™s Republic,"While the reality of human existence may appear to be an unfair and unreasonable arena, we humans are nevertheless called on to live fairly, justly, and morally. If a just and moral action and life includes elements of self-restraint, of waiving of what would seem to be in oneâ€™s interests, a question may very reasonably be asked regarding the motivation (not in terms of the general social realm, i.e. fear of social punishment or interest in gaining a social advantage) for acting and living justly and morally in such an unfair and unreasonable reality. From a moral education point of view, it may seem that, as teachers and parents, we have every reason, and even a duty and responsibility, to advise our students and children (face-to-face and behind closed doorsâ€”far from the general social realm) that, if they have an option to increase their relative advantage without risk to themselves or of being caught (let alone risking themselves for a big moral idea), they should do so without hesitation. Would you advise your children, students or yourself otherwise? If so, why? What is the rationale for moral education in our prima facie unfair and unreasonable world? After showing the limitations of another recently proposed answer to the question, one based on Meillassouxâ€™s ethic of immortality, I suggest an alternative based on a reading of Platoâ€™s Republic.

Globally, it is the women in Sub-Saharan Africa who face the highest risk of death and injury from abortion-related complications (Ahman & Shah 2011, p.123). Current global and national efforts to reduce incidences of unsafe abortion are ineffective in the rural Ghanaian community where this research was undertaken. This anthropological examination of key aspects of contemporary local social practice and the norms and customs which underpin it, demonstrates the necessity for many local women to utilise a dangerous plant to facilitate potentially fatal self-induced abortions as their primary means of resisting culturally-defined fertility patterns. This thesis is broadly structured around anthropologistsâ€™ Scheper-Hughesâ€™ and Lockâ€™s (1987, p.6) concept of three intersectional bodily perspectives: the phenomenological individual bodyself, the social body and the body as an artefact of political control. The reader is offered insight from each of these perspectives into the social practice of unsafe abortion in the lives of some rural Ghanaian women. I argue that unsafe abortion can be seen as a kind of social struggle against the local economic mode of production. The thesis provides an analysis of the position of many women within local relations of production from a neo-Marxist perspective which has been modified by concepts of class and exploitation particular to preindustrialist societies. The modifications are taken from the theoretical positions of French anthropologists Terray (1975), Meillassoux (1972) and P.P Rey (1975). In addition, following the work of critical medical anthropologist Scheper-Hughes (1993), the thesis demonstrates the ways in which medical discourses and policy output about family planning and reproductive health which are produced and reproduced at the level of the national body politic, obscure more deeply embedded powerful ideologies and social praxis about female sexuality and reproduction which is produced and reproduced at the level of the social body within the context of popular interpretations of tradition and customary law. Ultimately, I argue that current Programmes of Action aimed at reducing incidences of unsafe abortion fail to address patterns of gender violence and patriarchal control by medicalising some village womenâ€™s social suffering.",2012,
The key actors maintaining elders in functional,"Background: Globally, a significant increase in functional disability among the elderly is expected in the near future. It is therefore vital to begin considering how Sub-Saharan Africa countries can best start building or strengthening the care and support system for that target population. Study objectives are: 1) identify the key actors of the social system who maintain elders in functional autonomy at home in Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina Faso) and 2) to describe the functional status of older people living at home. Methods: We conducted a longitudinal descriptive study among the elderly aged 60 and above (351). Their functional status was evaluated using the Functional Autonomy Measurement System (SMAF). Data analysis was done using the statistical software package STATA (SE11). Results: In Bobo-Dioulasso, 68% of seniors have good functional capacity or a slight incapacity and 32% have moderate to severe incapacities. Older people die before (3%) or during (14%) moderate to severe disabilities. This would mean that the quality of medical and/or social care is not good for maintaining functional autonomy of older people with moderate to severe disabilities. Two main groups of people contribute to maintain elders in functional autonomy: the elderly themselves and their family. Community, private or public structures for maintaining elders in functional autonomy are non-existent. The social system for maintaining elders in functional autonomy is incomplete and failing. In case of functional handicap at home, the elders die. But stakeholders are not conscious of this situation; they believe that this system is good for maintaining elders in functional autonomy. Conclusion: It is likely that the absence of formal care and support structure likely shortens the lifespan of severely disabled older people. Stakeholders have not yet looked at this possibility. The stakeholders should seriously think about: 1) how to establish the third level of actors who can fulfill the needs to maintain elders in functional autonomy that are not satisfied by others (family members or the older individuals themselves), and 2) how to reinforce the role of each actor and the collaboration between the different groups of people of this system.",2014,
[Electroanatomical mapping and radiofrequency ablation of tachycardia originating in pulmonary vein in an adult patient].,"A 29-year-old male was admitted to our outpatient clinic because of palpitation and documented narrow QRS arrhythmia. Based on the ECG, supraventricular tachycardia was diagnosed, electrophysiological examination was indicated and ablation therapy was recommended. During positioning of the catheter the patient developed arrhythmia. On the coronary sinus catheter the activation spread from distal to proximal electrodes, suggesting left atrial origin. During atrial entrainment pacing long return cycle was observed and distal coronary sinus pacing resulted in a 15 ms longer cycle length than the arrhythmia. Therefore, the left atrial origin of the arrhythmia was confirmed and double transseptal puncture was performed. Lasso and irrigated tip catheter were introduced into the left atrium and electroanatomical mapping was performed with CARTO3 system. After electroanatomical mapping the origin of tachycardia was located proximally in the left superior pulmonary vein. Ablation was started at the earliest activation point, where acceleration was observed and the arrhythmia stopped after the first ablation. Pulmonary vein isolation was completed, and bidirectional block could be confirmed. After 30 minutes the arrhythmia was not inducible. During follow-up, Holter-examination was negative and the patient remained asymptomatic. The pulmonary vein tachycardia is a supraventricular arrhythmia that can occur at any age, but the diagnosis based on the ECG is not always simple. Detailed electroanatomical mapping is very important in the diagnosis of this type of arrhythmia, although it can be verified with conventional electrophysiological methods as well. Focal ablation may be a therapeutic option; however, total isolation of pulmonary veins can be more effective.",2011,Orvosi hetilap
"Phenomenology and the Problem of the Inhuman: Psychologism, Correlationism, and the Ethics of Absolute Materiality","All phenomena appear to and are circumscribed by some form of conscious life â€“ this is sine qua non of phenomenological inquiry. How then is phenomenology to account for those objects which appear to conscious life precisely in their refusal to be contained by conscious life â€“ objects which seem to testify to that which is radically outside of and other than consciousness? This is a challenge which has haunted phenomenology from its beginning, first under the guise of psychologism as diagnosed by Frege, but more recently under the heading of correlationism as addressed by Meillassoux. Whatever its name, the problem is the same: phenomenologyâ€™s apparent inability to account for the radical alterity of certain manifest existents. This paper will examine the ways in which both Husserl and Heidegger failed to respond adequately to this problem. To illustrate this failure, the phenomenological status of the dead body of will be examined. The aim of this paper is to show that while classical phenomenology cannot account for the inhuman realty of such phenomena, the alternatives offered by Frege and the speculative realists fare no better, occulting in their solutions the inherent traumatic power of such phenomena. To explore this power, the work of Freud and Lacan will be drawn upon. Finally, this paper will conclude that it is only through a reappraisal and reinterpretation of the ethics of Emmanuel Levinas that the limitations of both phenomenology and its critics can finally be overcome.",2017,
Making room for the modeler in data mining,"I would like to use this perspective to advocate further research in data mining toward methods that allow and formalize greater input from the modeler. By â€˜modelerâ€™, I mean the domain expert, scientist, business analyst, or researcher who has questions to answer using data. Soliciting input from such users is atypical of most data mining algorithms (e.g., see the introductory discussion in ref. [1]). Although excluding pesky users enables one to enforce protections against, say, overfitting, those same users may come to resent the exclusion. Many fields remain deeply suspicious of black-box models that generate predictions without asking for help or supplying explanations. Handpicked regression models remain the model of choice in the social sciences, for instance, because these allow the user to pick the features and specify the relationships. Regression allows the model to express a theory about how the world works, and the success of the model depends on this specification. To this community, the fact that we can automate the process of selecting features or supply black-box predictions that are more accurate than those of regression is secondary to the absence of interpretative hooks. Allowing the user to customize a statistical model introduces any number of problems. With practice and a bit of collinearity in the data, one can mold a regression model to support a variety of theories by iteratively adding and removing variables. We know how to keep an automated search for features from overfitting; the challenge is to involve users in this process. Modelers who invest years gathering data are not eager to lay down their favorite tools unless we provide them with alternatives that respect their knowledge of the context and their desire to influence the analysis. A modeler who has a better theory and understanding of the data should be able to get a better model than one who lacks these insights. Black-box models remove the competitive advantage: both modelers pour the data into the model and pop out the same predictions. The methodologies that I want to encourage reward the modeler who has useful insights. I have a couple of illustrative examples in mind. First, consider the grouped LASSO [2] in the classical regression setting: for a sample of n observations, we observe a response y and k explanatory features in the vector x. The goal is a precise estimate of E y = x â€²Î². The original LASSO provides a method for identifying useful features. Rather than relying on stepwise or heuristic searches, LASSO selects the coefficient vector Î²Ì‚ that solves",2012,Statistical Analysis and Data Mining

LASSO model adaptation for automatic speech recognition,"ï€  Inspired by the success of least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) in statistical learning, we propose an regularized maximum likelihood linear regression (MLLR) to estimate models with only a limited set of adaptation data to improve accuracy for automatic speech recognition, by regularizing the standard MLLR objective function with an constraint. The so-called LASSO MLLR is a natural solution to the data insufficiency problem because the constraint regularizes some parameters to exactly 0 and reduces the number of free parameters to estimate. Tested on the 5kWSJ0 task, the proposed LASSO MLLR gives significant word error rate reduction from the errors obtained with the standard MLLR in an utterance-by-utterance unsupervised adaptation scenario.",2011,
An Augmented ADMM Algorithm With Application to the Generalized Lasso Problem,"ABSTRACTIn this article, we present a fast and stable algorithm for solving a class of optimization problems that arise in many statistical estimation procedures, such as sparse fused lasso over a graph, convex clustering, and trend filtering, among others. We propose a so-called augmented alternating direction methods of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm to solve this class of problems. Compared to a standard ADMM algorithm, our proposal significantly reduces the computational cost at each iteration while maintaining roughly the same overall convergence speed. We also consider a new varying penalty scheme for the ADMM algorithm, which could further accelerate the convergence, especially when solving a sequence of problems with tuning parameters of different scales. Extensive numerical experiments on the sparse fused lasso problem show that the proposed algorithm is more efficient than the standard ADMM and two other existing state-of-the-art specialized algorithms. Finally, we discuss a possible extension and...",2017,Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics
Use of electronic health record data and machine learning to identify candidates for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis: a modelling study.,"BACKGROUND
The limitations of existing HIV risk prediction tools are a barrier to implementation of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). We developed and validated an HIV prediction model to identify potential PrEP candidates in a large health-care system.


METHODS
Our study population was HIV-uninfected adult members of Kaiser Permanente Northern California, a large integrated health-care system, who were not yet using PrEP and had at least 2 years of previous health plan enrolment with at least one outpatient visit from Jan 1, 2007, to Dec 31, 2017. Using 81 electronic health record (EHR) variables, we applied least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression to predict incident HIV diagnosis within 3 years on a subset of patients who entered the cohort in 2007-14 (development dataset), assessing ten-fold cross-validated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and 95% CIs. We compared the full model to simpler models including only men who have sex with men (MSM) status and sexually transmitted infection (STI) positivity, testing, and treatment. Models were validated prospectively with data from an independent set of patients who entered the cohort in 2015-17. We computed predicted probabilities of incident HIV diagnosis within 3 years (risk scores), categorised as low risk (<0Â·05%), moderate risk (0Â·05% to <0Â·20%), high risk (0Â·20% to <1Â·0%), and very high risk (â‰¥1Â·0%), for all patients in the validation dataset.


FINDINGS
Of 3â€ˆ750â€ˆ664 patients in 2007-17 (3â€ˆ143â€ˆ963 in the development dataset and 606â€ˆ701 in the validation dataset), there were 784 incident HIV cases within 3 years of baseline. The LASSO procedure retained 44 predictors in the full model, with an AUC of 0Â·86 (95% CI 0Â·85-0Â·87) for incident HIV cases in 2007-14. Model performance remained high in the validation dataset (AUC 0Â·84, 0Â·80-0Â·89). The full model outperformed simpler models including only MSM status and STI positivity. For the full model, flagging 13â€ˆ463 (2Â·2%) patients with high or very high HIV risk scores in the validation dataset identified 32 (38Â·6%) of the 83 incident HIV cases, including 32 (46Â·4%) of 69 male cases and none of the 14 female cases. The full model had equivalent sensitivity by race whereas simpler models identified fewer black than white HIV cases.


INTERPRETATION
Prediction models using EHR data can identify patients at high risk of HIV acquisition who could benefit from PrEP. Future studies should optimise EHR-based HIV risk prediction tools and evaluate their effect on prescription of PrEP.

An additive Cox model for coronary heart disease study,"ABSTRACT Existing models for coronary heart disease study use a set of common risk factors to predict the survival time of the disease, via the standard Cox regression model. For complex relationships between the survival time and risk factors, the linear regression specification in the existing Cox model is not flexible enough to accounts for such relationships. Also, the risk factors are actually risky only when they fall in some risk ranges. For more flexibility in modelling and characterize the risk factors more accurately, we study a semi-parametric additive Cox model, using basis splines and LASSO technique. The proposed model is evaluated by simulation studies and is used for the analysis of a real data in the Strong Heart Study.",2018,Journal of Applied Statistics
The Bigraphical Lasso,"The i.i.d. assumption in machine learning is endemic, but often flawed. Complex data sets exhibit partial correlations between both instances and features. A model specifying both types of correlation can have a number of parameters that scales quadratically with the number of features and data points. We introduce the bigraphical lasso, an estimator for precision matrices of matrix-normals based on the Cartesian product of graphs. A prominent product in spectral graph theory, this structure has appealing properties for regression, enhanced sparsity and interpretability. To deal with the parameter explosion we introduce l1 penalties and fit the model through a flip-flop algorithm that results in a linear number of lasso regressions. We demonstrate the performance of our approach with simulations and an example from the COIL image data set.",2013,
Impact of variable pelagic environments on natural larval growth and recruitment of the reef fish Thalassoma bifasciatum,"New recruits of the bluehead wrasse Thalassoma bifasciatum were censused and collected from nearshore reefs of Barbados, West Indies, every 2 weeks for 20 months. Their temporal coincidence with low salinity (<34Â·5) water during their pelagic larval stage was determined by comparing the otolith records of new recruits with conductivity and temperature records from a current meter moored 2Â km off the west coast of the island. Larval residence in a low salinity North Brazil Current (NBC) ring appeared to have a negative impact on growth. Larvae that encountered a NBC ring for at least 7 days during either the first half of the larval period exhibited slower larval growth than those that did not encounter a ring for 7 days during any part of their larval period. As a result of this slower growth, larvae that encountered low salinity waters had a longer pelagic larval duration and were larger at the time of settlement. The magnitude of settlement was not distinctly related to the presence or absence of a NBC ring, but the largest settlement event occurred at the end of the longest ring event. Early juvenile growth did not vary between fish that had encountered a ring and those that did not, so size differences at settlement were propagated through the first week of life on the reef. The potentially opposing attributes of fast and slow-growing larvae (e.g. fast growing larvae with shorter larval stage duration but smaller size at settlement and higher susceptibility to reef predation), and the resulting differential mortality on the reef may promote the persistence of individuals in the population with contrasting life history traits, and contribute to the lack of a relationship between larval growth and recruitment success. Positive transport related effects of rings (i.e. enhanced retention during some ring events) may further complicate matters by outweighing the negative impact of rings on larval growth.",2004,Journal of Fish Biology
Diversity of culturable moderately halophilic and halotolerant bacteria in a marsh and two salterns a protected ecosystem of Lower Loukkos (Morocco),"To study the biodiversity of halophilic bacteria in a protected wetland located in Loukkos (Northwest, Morocco), a total of 124 strains were recovered from sediment samples from a marsh and salterns. 120 isolates (98%) were found to be moderately halophilic bacteria; growing in salt ranges of 0.5 to 20%. Of 124 isolates, 102 were Gram-positive while 22 were Gram negative. All isolates were identified based on 16S rRNA gene phylogenetic analysis and characterized phenotypically and by screening for extracellular hydrolytic enzymes. The Gram-positive isolates were dominated by the genus Bacillus (89%) and the others were assigned to Jeotgalibacillus, Planococcus, Staphylococcus and Thalassobacillus. The Gram negative isolates were dominated by the genus Vibrio (41%) and the others were assigned to Halomonas, Psychrobacter, Marinobacterium, Pseudoalteromonas, Salinivibrio and Photobacterium. The growth of strains obtained under different physico-chemical conditions and the screening for hydrolytic enzymes showed a high diversity even within the same species.",2012,African Journal of Microbiology Research
Classification of team sport activities using a single wearable tracking device.,"Wearable tracking devices incorporating accelerometers and gyroscopes are increasingly being used for activity analysis in sports. However, minimal research exists relating to their ability to classify common activities. The purpose of this study was to determine whether data obtained from a single wearable tracking device can be used to classify team sport-related activities. Seventy-six non-elite sporting participants were tested during a simulated team sport circuit (involving stationary, walking, jogging, running, changing direction, counter-movement jumping, jumping for distance and tackling activities) in a laboratory setting. A MinimaxX S4 wearable tracking device was worn below the neck, in-line and dorsal to the first to fifth thoracic vertebrae of the spine, with tri-axial accelerometer and gyroscope data collected at 100Hz. Multiple time domain, frequency domain and custom features were extracted from each sensor using 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5s movement capture durations. Features were further screened using a combination of ANOVA and Lasso methods. Relevant features were used to classify the eight activities performed using the Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Model Tree (LMT) algorithms. The LMT (79-92% classification accuracy) outperformed RF (32-43%) and SVM algorithms (27-40%), obtaining strongest performance using the full model (accelerometer and gyroscope inputs). Processing time can be reduced through feature selection methods (range 1.5-30.2%), however a trade-off exists between classification accuracy and processing time. Movement capture duration also had little impact on classification accuracy or processing time. In sporting scenarios where wearable tracking devices are employed, it is both possible and feasible to accurately classify team sport-related activities.",2015,Journal of biomechanics
Estimating Sparse Networks with Hubs,"Graphical modelling techniques based on sparse selection have been applied to infer complex networks in many fields, including biology and medicine, engineering, finance, and social sciences. One structural feature of some of the networks in such applications that poses a challenge for statistical inference is the presence of a small number of strongly interconnected nodes in a network which are called hubs. For example, in microbiome research hubs or microbial taxa play a significant role in maintaining stability of the microbial community structure. In this paper, we investigate the problem of estimating sparse networks in which there are a few highly connected hub nodes. Methods based on L1-regularization have been widely used for performing sparse selection in the graphical modelling context. However, while these methods encourage sparsity, they do not take into account structural information of the network. We introduce a new method for estimating networks with hubs that exploits the ability of (inverse) covariance selection methods to include structural information about the underlying network. Our proposed method is a weighted lasso approach with novel row/column sum weights, which we refer to as the hubs weighted graphical lasso. We establish large sample properties of the method when the number of parameters diverges with the sample size, and evaluate its finite sample performance via extensive simulations. We illustrate the method with an application to microbiome data.",2019,arXiv: Statistics Theory

Wavelet-based LASSO in functional linear regression.,"In linear regression with functional predictors and scalar responses, it may be advantageous, particularly if the function is thought to contain features at many scales, to restrict the coefficient function to the span of a wavelet basis, thereby converting the problem into one of variable selection. If the coefficient function is sparsely represented in the wavelet domain, we may employ the well-known LASSO to select a relatively small number of nonzero wavelet coefficients. This is a natural approach to take but to date, the properties of such an estimator have not been studied. In this paper we describe the wavelet-based LASSO approach to regressing scalars on functions and investigate both its asymptotic convergence and its finite-sample performance through both simulation and real-data application. We compare the performance of this approach with existing methods and find that the wavelet-based LASSO performs relatively well, particularly when the true coefficient function is spiky.

Effective Sparse Channel Estimation for Wireless Multipath Systems,"In real communication systems, most of the multipath channels tend to exhibit sparse behavior.

Simulations show that the proposed algorithm has better MSE performance compared with the traditional Least Square (LS) method and the Lasso algorithm on CS domain.",2012,
Marginal false discovery rate approaches to inference on penalized regression models,"Penalized regression methods, most notably the lasso, are a popular analysis tool for data sets containing large numbers of a variables due to their ability to naturally perform variable selection. However, performing statistical inference on lasso models is difficult, making the topic an active area of research. Much of the literature on inferential methods for penalized regression models is focused exclusively on the linear regression setting, with few options available for models with categorical or survival outcomes. This dissertation proposes novel false discovery rate methods for a broad class of penalized likelihood modeling approaches that includes not only linear regression, but also generalized linear models, such as logistic regression, and survival models, such as Cox regression. The methods we propose are designed to be suitable next steps after fitting a penalized likelihood model, requiring minimal added computation or inputs other than the fitted model. The methods proposed in this dissertation deal with two broad categories of false discovery rates that exist in the large-scale hypothesis testing literature. In the first category are tail-area based approaches, which pertain to the overall false discovery rate for an entire set of rejected hypotheses. In the case of penalized regression, this is the entire set of variables active in the model. In the second category are local approaches, which refer to the specific probabilities of single variables being false discoveries, in the regression setting local approaches describe each active variable individually. Both types of false discovery rates are valuable tools depending upon the inferential question, and this dissertation proposes methods falling into both categories. In addition to making these proposals and investigating their properties using simulation, we also look at applying the methods to several case studies involving",2018,
"Epiphytic calcium carbonate production and facies development within sub-tropical seagrass beds, Inhaca Island, Mozambique","Abstract Seagrass beds have been widely recognised as playing an important role in influencing carbonate sediment facies development. This reflects their role not only as facilitators of fine sediment settling and stabilisation, but also as substrates for epiphytic organisms that, after death, contribute skeletal carbonate to the sediment substrate. In low latitude (reef-related) settings, epiphytic carbonate production rates are often high and this, in combination with the trapping of carbonate mud produced by a range of associated calcareous algal species, typically results in the development of carbonate mud-rich facies. Whilst such environments, and their associated sediment substrates, have been widely documented, studies of seagrass facies in marginal (sub-tropical/warm temperate) marine settings have not been conducted from a sedimentological perspective. This study determines rates of epiphytic carbonate production on two seagrass species Thalassodendron ciliatum and Thalassia hemprichii, and examines seagrass sediment facies from a sub-tropical reef-related environment in southern Mozambique. Dense seagrass beds colonise primarily siliciclastic sediment substrates and are characterised by low rates of epiphytic carbonate production (mean: 43.9 g CaCO3 mâˆ’2 yearâˆ’1 for T. ciliatum, and 33.4 g CaCO3 mâˆ’2 yearâˆ’1 for T. hemprichii). Epiphytic encrusters are dominated by thin, monostromatic layers of the crustose coralline red algae Hydrolithon farinosum, along with rotaliid smaller benthic foraminifera (including Asterorotalia cf. gaimardi and Spirillina sp.) and the soritid Peneroplis sp., as well as rare encrusting acervulinid foraminifera, serpulids and bryozoans. Epiphytic calcium carbonate production rates are therefore low and this is reflected in the low (",2005,Sedimentary Geology

Activity Identification and Local Linear Convergence of Forward-Backward-type Methods,"In this paper, we consider a class of Forward--Backward (FB) splitting methods that includes several variants (e.g. inertial schemes, FISTA) for minimizing the sum of two proper convex and lower semi-continuous functions, one of which has a Lipschitz continuous gradient, and the other is partly smooth relatively to a smooth active manifold $\mathcal{M}$. We propose a unified framework, under which we show that, this class of FB-type algorithms (i) correctly identifies the active manifolds in a finite number of iterations (finite activity identification), and (ii) then enters a local linear convergence regime, which we characterize precisely in terms of the structure of the underlying active manifolds. For simpler problems involving polyhedral functions, we show finite termination. We also establish and explain why FISTA (with convergent sequences) locally oscillates and can be slower than FB. These results may have numerous applications including in signal/image processing, sparse recovery and machine learning. Indeed, the obtained results explain the typical behaviour that has been observed numerically for many problems in these fields such as the Lasso, the group Lasso, the fused Lasso and the nuclear norm regularization to name only a few.",2017,SIAM Journal on Optimization

Twenty-four patients were reconstructed with the flexor digitorum 4-tail (FDS 4-tail) procedure, 11 with the extensor carpi radialis 4-tail (ECRL 4-tail) procedure and 9 with Zancolli's Lasso procedure (ZLP) with mean paralysis times of 47, 51, and 32 months, respectively. Grip strength measurements, improvement in active range of motion at the PIP and wrist joints, patients' ability to fully open and close their hands, as well as the sequence of phalangeal flexion were analyzed.


RESULTS
Age, sex, mean follow-up duration, and surgical technique did not relate statistically to the functional outcome. Preoperative extensor lag of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint and mean paralysis time, however, significantly affected the functional outcome. The ZLP and the ECRL 4-tail were found to be the most effective technique in restoring grip strength. The FDS 4-tail procedure, however, was the most successful in correcting the claw hand deformity, especially in long-standing paralysis in which there was elongation of the extensor apparatus.


CONCLUSIONS
In short-term paralysis in which patients predominantly need grip strength and claw finger deformity correction, the ZLP or ECRL 4-tail procedures are recommended. In long-standing cases with extensor lag, asynchronous finger motion should be corrected with the FDS 4-tail procedure.",2003,The Journal of hand surgery
Directional fingerprint processing,"We present fingerprint smoothing, classification and identification based on the singular points (delta and core points) obtained from the directional histograms of a fingerprint. Fingerprints are classified into two main categories that are called Lasso and Wirbel. The process includes directional image formation, directional image block representation, singular point detection and decision, and fingerprint classification and identification, respectively. By matching decision vectors with minimum error, this algorithm is simple and fast.",1998,ICSP '98. 1998 Fourth International Conference on Signal Processing (Cat. No.98TH8344)
Recent developments of copula-based models to handle missing data of mixed-type in multivariate analysis,"In this thesis, we propose innovative imputation models to handle missing data of mixed-type. Our imputation models can handle 1) multilevel data sets through random effects; 2) heterogeneity in a population by specifying infinite mixture models; and 3) a large number of variables using graphical lasso methods. Two clinical data sets, a randomised control trial of acute stroke care patients and a survey of menstrual disorder among teenagers, are used for the real data application examples, although we believe that the proposed methods can also be applied to other data sets with similar structures. In Chapter 2, we propose a copula based method to handle missing values in multivariate data of mixed type in multilevel data sets. Building upon the extended rank likelihood approach combined with a multinomial probit model formulation, our model is a latent variable model which is able to capture the relationship among variables of different types as well as accounting for the clustering structure. Our proposed method is evaluated through simulations using both artificial data and the acute stroke data set to compare it with several conventional methods of handling missing data. We conclude that our proposed copula based imputation model for mixed type variables achieves good imputation accuracy and recovery of parameters in some models of interest, and that adding random effects enhances performance when the clustering effect is strong. In Chapter 3, we consider an infinite mixture of elliptical copulas induced by a Dirichlet process mixture to build a flexible copula function as the imputation model. A slice sampling algorithm is used in conjunction with a prior parallel ix",2018,
Sliding Mode Controller Design: An input-output approach,"In this presentation, we propose a linear based sliding modecontrol scheme for trajectory tracking in internally, or externally,perturbed switched input-output dynamical systems. The classof systems treated with this approach spans the class ofminimum phase systems, whether linear, nonlinear,mono-variable or multi-variable, continuous, or discrete-time,nature with, or without, control input delays and including, ornot, fractional derivatives. So, it naturally applies to differentiallyï¬‚at systems.Here we specialize to the implications of the approach in slidingmode controller design for nonlinear SISO systems.",2010,
Online heterogeneous feature fusion machines for visual recognition,"Heterogeneous Feature Fusion Machines (HFFM) is a kernel based logistic regression model that effectively fuses multiple features for visual recognition tasks. However, the batch mode solution for HFFM, 'Block Coordinate Gradient Descent' (BCGD) has the same low efficiency and poor scalability as the most batch algorithms do. In this paper, we describe a newly developed online learning algorithm in multiple Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces for solving HFFM model. This new algorithm is called OLHFFM, i.e. Online HFFM. OLHFFM is novel combination of kernel-based learning technique with dual averaging gradient descent methods. In addition, group LASSO regularization technique is used in OLHFFM for finding important explanatory coefficients that are related to support samples in group manner. The effectiveness of OLHFFM has been demonstrated by a number of experiments that were conducted on public event, object dataset, as well as on large scale handwritten digital dataset. Using the OLHFFM approach, we have achieved almost equivalent recognition performance to that using batch-mode approach. Experiments conducted on both MIT Caltech-6 and challenging VOC2011 TrainVal object datasets show that OLHFFM is superior in performance to kernel based online learning approaches such as ILK or NORMA. In addition, the classification performance of OLHFFM approach as demonstrated by the experiments conducted on large scale MNIST dataset is comparable to or better than that of the current state-of-the-art online multiple kernel learning approaches such as OM-2, UFO-MKL, OMCL and OMKL. Extensive experiments on visual data classification demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the new OLHFFM approach.",2014,Neurocomputing
Penalized multimarker vs. single-marker regression methods for genome-wide association studies of quantitative traits.,"The data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in humans are still predominantly analyzed using single-marker association methods. As an alternative to single-marker analysis (SMA), all or subsets of markers can be tested simultaneously. This approach requires a form of penalized regression (PR) as the number of SNPs is much larger than the sample size. Here we review PR methods in the context of GWAS, extend them to perform penalty parameter and SNP selection by false discovery rate (FDR) control, and assess their performance in comparison with SMA. PR methods were compared with SMA, using realistically simulated GWAS data with a continuous phenotype and real data. Based on these comparisons our analytic FDR criterion may currently be the best approach to SNP selection using PR for GWAS. We found that PR with FDR control provides substantially more power than SMA with genome-wide type-I error control but somewhat less power than SMA with Benjamini-Hochberg FDR control (SMA-BH). PR with FDR-based penalty parameter selection controlled the FDR somewhat conservatively while SMA-BH may not achieve FDR control in all situations. Differences among PR methods seem quite small when the focus is on SNP selection with FDR control. Incorporating linkage disequilibrium into the penalization by adapting penalties developed for covariates measured on graphs can improve power but also generate more false positives or wider regions for follow-up. We recommend the elastic net with a mixing weight for the Lasso penalty near 0.5 as the best method.",2015,Genetics
A 17-gene expression-based prognostic signature associated with the prognosis of patients with breast cancer: A STROBE-compliant study.,"Identification of reliable predictive biomarkers for patients with breast cancer (BC).Univariate Cox proportional hazards regression model was conducted to identify genes correlated with the overall survival (OS) of patients in the TCGA-BRCA cohort. Functional enrichment analysis was conducted to investigate the biological meaning of these survival related genes. Then, patients in TCGA-BCRA were randomly divided into training set and test. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) penalized Cox regression model was performed and the risk score of BC patients in this model was used to build a prognostic signature. The prognostic performance of the signature was evaluated in the training set, test set, and an independent validation set GSE7390.2519 genes were demonstrated to be significantly associated with the OS of BC patients. Functional annotation of the 2519 genes suggested that these genes were associated with immune response and protein synthesis related gene ontology terms and pathways. 17 genes were identified in the LASSO Cox regression model and used to construct a 17-gene signature. Patients in the 17-gene signature low risk group have better OS and event-free survival compared with those in the 17-gene signature high risk group in the TCGA-BRCA cohort. The prognostic role of the 17-gene signature has been confirmed in the validation cohort. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model suggested the 17-gene signature was an independent prognostic factor in BC.The 17-gene signature we developed could successfully classify patients into high- and low-risk groups, indicating that it might serve as candidate biomarker in BC.",2020,Medicine
Phase I Distribution-Free Analysis of Multivariate Data,"ABSTRACTIn this study, a new distribution-free Phase I control chart for retrospectively monitoring multivariate data is developed. The suggested approach, based on the multivariate signed ranks, can be applied to individual or subgrouped data for detection of location shifts with an arbitrary pattern (e.g., isolated, transitory, sustained, progressive, etc.). The procedure is complemented with a LASSO-based post-signal diagnostic method for identification of the shifted variables. A simulation study shows that the method compares favorably with parametric control charts when the process is normally distributed, and largely outperforms other multivariate nonparametric control charts when the process distribution is skewed or heavy-tailed. An R package can be found in the supplementary material.",2017,Technometrics
Under Revision for the Annals of Statistics BAYESIAN ESTIMATION OF SPARSE SIGNALS WITH A CONTINUOUS SPIKE-AND-SLAB PRIOR By,"We introduce a new framework for estimation of sparse normal means, bridging the gap between popular frequentist strategies (LASSO) and popular Bayesian strategies (spike-and-slab). The main thrust of this paper is to introduce the family of Spike-andSlab LASSO (SS-LASSO) priors, which form a continuum between the Laplace prior and the point-mass spike-and-slab prior. We establish several appealing frequentist properties of SS-LASSO priors, contrasting them with these two limiting cases. First, we adopt the penalized likelihood perspective on Bayesian modal estimation and introduce the framework of Bayesian penalty mixing with spike-andslab priors. We show that the SS-LASSO global posterior mode is (near) minimax rate-optimal under squared error loss, similarly as the LASSO. Going further, we introduce an adaptive two-step estimator which can achieve provably sharper performance than the LASSO. Second, we show that the whole posterior keeps pace with the global mode and concentrates at the (near) minimax rate, a property that is known not to hold for the single Laplace prior. The minimax-rate optimality is obtained with a suitable class of independent product priors (for known levels of sparsity) as well as with dependent mixing priors (adapting to the unknown levels of sparsity). Up to now, the rate-optimal posterior concentration has been established only for spike-and-slab priors with a point mass at zero. Thus, the SS-LASSO priors, despite being continuous, possess similar optimality properties as the â€œtheoretically idealâ€ point-mass mixtures. These results provide valuable theoretical justification for our proposed class of priors, underpinning their intuitive appeal and practical potential.",2017,
Recursive sparse identification for adaptive control,"Motivated by applications in adaptive control, this article compares two recursive estimation algorithms for sparse estimation of linear dynamical (ARX) models. In most practical situations an accurate mathematical model estimation of a real system using the least number of parameters is highly desirable. The expectation of sparsity is imposed through minimization of an objective function that includes a quadratic error term combined with a sparsity-inducing regularization term. The Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) is a well-known example of this approach. The increasing complexity and memory requirements of LASSO inspire the development of recursive algorithms that use the i\-norm and the Â¿1-weighted norm. The two algorithms considered consist of a modification of recursive LASSO by the addition of a i1-weighted regularization term. In one case subgradient minimizers are used, while the proximal gradient is used in the other. Simulation results show that the use of the proximal gradient is advantageous.",2017,2017 25th Mediterranean Conference on Control and Automation (MED)

Feature Constrained Multi-Task Learning Models for Spatiotemporal Event Forecasting,"Spatial event forecasting from social media is potentially extremely useful but suffers from critical challenges, such as the dynamic patterns of features (keywords) and geographic heterogeneity (e.g., spatial correlations, imbalanced samples, and different populations in different locations). Most existing approaches (e.g., LASSO regression, dynamic query expansion, and burst detection) address some, but not all, of these challenges. Here, we propose a novel multi-task learning framework that aims to concurrently address all the challenges involved. Specifically, given a collection of locations (e.g., cities), forecasting models are built for all the locations simultaneously by extracting and utilizing appropriate shared information that effectively increases the sample size for each location, thus improving the forecasting performance. The new model combines both static features derived from a predefined vocabulary by domain experts and dynamic features generated from dynamic query expansion in a multi-task feature learning framework. Different strategies to balance homogeneity and diversity between static and dynamic terms are also investigated. And, efficient algorithms based on Iterative Group Hard Thresholding are developed to achieve efficient and effective model training and prediction. Extensive experimental evaluations on Twitter data from civil unrest and influenza outbreak datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed approach.",2017,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering

Relating Brain Functional Connectivity to Anatomical Connections: Model Selection,"We aim to learn across several subjects a mapping from brain anatomical connectivity to functional connectivity. Following [1], we formulate this problem as estimating a multivariate autoregressive (MAR) model with sparse linear regression. We introduce a model selection framework based on cross-validation. We select the appropriate sparsity of the connectivity matrices and demonstrate that choosing an ordering for the MAR that lends to sparser models is more appropriate than a random.

An anthropometry-based nomogram for predicting metabolic syndrome in the working population,"Background: Early detection of metabolic syndrome is highly desirable for the prevention and treatment of various diseases. Therefore, this study aimed to develop and validate an anthropometry-based nomogram for predicting metabolic syndrome in a working population. Methods: The present study was a secondary analysis of a cross-sectional study. A total of 60,799 workers in Spain were enrolled between 2012 and 2016, of which 50% were randomly assigned to the derivation cohort and the remainder to the validation cohort. Participantsâ€™ demographics and anthropometric variables were entered into least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression for the selection of variables. Subsequently, multivariable logistic regression was performed to develop the predictive model and a nomogram. The discrimination ability, calibration curve analysis and decision curve analysis of the nomogram was evaluated. Internal validation of the model was also performed. Results: There were 2725 (9.0%) participants diagnosed with metabolic syndrome in the derivation cohort and 2762 (9.1%) participants in the validation cohort. Six variables (age, smoking, body fat percentage, waist circumference, systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure were included in the nomogram. The area under the curve was 0.901 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.895â€“0.906) and 0.899 (95% CI 0.894â€“0.905) for the predictive and internal validation, respectively. Furthermore, decision curve analysis showed that if the threshold probability of metabolic syndrome is less than 72.0%, application of this nomogram can benefit more than either the treat-all or treat-none strategies. Conclusions: An anthropometry-based nomogram for predicting metabolic syndrome in a working population was developed that incorporates reliable non-invasive anthropometric features to facilitate health counselling and self-risk assessment of developing metabolic syndrome.",2019,European Journal of Cardiovascular Nursing
A simple way to allow continuous ventilation during tracheostomy,"The advantage of passing the standing end through the fenestration as shown is that the knot is always easily retrieved should the forceps and standing end become misaligned during the pushing process.

On the properties of simulation-based estimators in high dimensions,"Considering the increasing size of available data, the need for statistical methods that control the finite sample bias is growing. This is mainly due to the frequent settings where the number of variables is large and allowed to increase with the sample size bringing standard inferential procedures to incur significant loss in terms of performance. Moreover, the complexity of statistical models is also increasing thereby entailing important computational challenges in constructing new estimators or in implementing classical ones. A trade-off between numerical complexity and statistical properties is often accepted. However, numerically efficient estimators that are altogether unbiased, consistent and asymptotically normal in high dimensional problems would generally be ideal. In this paper, we set a general framework from which such estimators can easily be derived for wide classes of models. This framework is based on the concepts that underlie simulation-based estimation methods such as indirect inference. The approach allows various extensions compared to previous results as it is adapted to possibly inconsistent estimators and is applicable to discrete models and/or models with a large number of parameters. We consider an algorithm, namely the Iterative Bootstrap (IB), to efficiently compute simulation-based estimators by showing its convergence properties. Within this framework we also prove the properties of simulation-based estimators, more specifically the unbiasedness, consistency and asymptotic normality when the number of parameters is allowed to increase with the sample size. Therefore, an important implication of the proposed approach is that it allows to obtain unbiased estimators in finite samples. Finally, we study this approach when applied to three common models, namely logistic regression, negative binomial regression and lasso regression.",2018,arXiv: Statistics Theory
Effects of Growth Conditions on Hydrophobicity in Marine Obligate Hydrocarbonoclastic Bacteria,"The aims of this work is study the influence of different growth conditions (different concentration of carbon source) on the variation of cellular hydrophobicity (capacity to adhere at polystyrene) of two obligate hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria, Alcanivorax borkumensis SK2 and Thalassolituus oleivorans MIL-1. The strains were inoculated, separately, in ONR7a mineral medium whit different concentration of sodium acetate. During all period of experimentation (10 days) measures of cellular abundance and cellular hydrophobicity (capacity to adhere at polystyrene) were carried out. Data obtained revealed as addition of carbon source and growth status are important factor in the regulation of adhesion to surface and as in these process Alcanivorax present an advantage respect Thalassolituus in all experimental condition. The understanding of capacity to adhesion of these bacteria for utilization of hydrophobic compounds is fundamental for their potential use in the mitigation of oil spills phenomenon and the importance of these preliminary data resides mainly in biotechnological applications, especially in reference to application of this bacteria in bioremediation strategies.",2015,
Multimodal Integration of Brain Images for MRI-Based Diagnosis in Schizophrenia,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been proposed as a source of information for automatic prediction of individual diagnosis in schizophrenia. Optimal integration of data from different MRI modalities is an active area of research aimed at increasing diagnostic accuracy. Based on a sample of 96 patients with schizophrenia and a matched sample of 115 healthy controls that had undergone a single multimodal MRI session, we generated individual brain maps of gray matter vbm, 1back, and 2back levels of activation (nback fMRI), maps of amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (resting-state fMRI), and maps of weighted global brain connectivity (resting-state fMRI). Four unimodal classifiers (Ridge, Lasso, Random Forests, and Gradient boosting) were applied to these maps to evaluate their classification accuracies. Based on the assignments made by the algorithms on test individuals, we quantified the amount of predictive information shared between maps (what we call redundancy analysis). Finally, we explored the added accuracy provided by a set of multimodal strategies that included post-classification integration based on probabilities, two-step sequential integration, and voxel-level multimodal integration through one-dimensional-convolutional neural networks (1D-CNNs). All four unimodal classifiers showed the highest test accuracies with the 2back maps (80% on average) achieving a maximum of 84% with the Lasso. Redundancy levels between brain maps were generally low (overall mean redundancy score of 0.14 in a 0-1 range), indicating that each brain map contained differential predictive information. The highest multimodal accuracy was delivered by the two-step Ridge classifier (87%) followed by the Ridge maximum and mean probability classifiers (both with 85% accuracy) and by the 1D-CNN, which achieved the same accuracy as the best unimodal classifier (84%). From these results, we conclude that from all MRI modalities evaluated task-based fMRI may be the best unimodal diagnostic option in schizophrenia. Low redundancy values point to ample potential for accuracy improvements through multimodal integration, with the two-step Ridge emerging as a suitable strategy.",2019,Frontiers in Neuroscience
"Heterospecific intruders, territorial defense and reproductive success in the beaugregory damselfish","Abstract A territorial defender is expected to attack an intruder based on the intruder's ability to harvest the defender's crucial resources within the territory. This prediction was tested using the territorial beaugregory damselfish Stegastes leucostictus Muller & Troschel and three different species of intruders; a herbivore ( Scarus iserti Bloch), an egg predator ( Thalassoma bifasciatum Bloch), a conspecific male. The defender's attack behavior was expected to correlate with a species potential in eating the current clutch of eggs and/or influencing the total amount of eggs secured by the defender over the summer. Intruders were tested by placing individuals in clear bottles within the defender's territory. When eggs were absent, the defender's attack rate was highest against the herbivore. When guarding eggs the defender escalated its attack behavior, uniformly, against all species. The intensity of the attack was correlated to the size of his clutch only when the intruder was the egg predator. When intruders were presented in pairs, and one of the intruders was the conspecific male, the defender always positioned himself near the bottle containing the conspecific male. Only when guarding eggs did the defending male differentiate between the egg predator and the herbivore. The total number of eggs the defender secured over the summer was not significantly correlated to his aggressive level against conspecific intruders. Thus defending males appeared to use proximate cues for defense rather than the long term reproductive benefits gained from maintaining the territory.",1990,Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology
Structure Learning in Graphical Modeling,"A graphical model is a statistical model that is associated to a graph whose nodes correspond to variables of interest. The edges of the graph reflect allowed conditional dependencies among the variables. Graphical models admit computationally convenient factorization properties and have long been a valuable tool for tractable modeling of multivariate distributions. More recently, applications such as reconstructing gene regulatory networks from gene expression data have driven major advances in structure learning, that is, estimating the graph underlying a model. We review some of these advances and discuss methods such as the graphical lasso and neighborhood selection for undirected graphical models (or Markov random fields), and the PC algorithm and score-based search methods for directed graphical models (or Bayesian networks). We further review extensions that account for effects of latent variables and heterogeneous data sources.",2016,arXiv: Methodology
Object Recognition With an Elastic Net-Regularized Hierarchical MAX Model of the Visual Cortex,"The human visual cortex has evolved to determine efficiently objects from within a scene. Hierarchical MAX (HMAX) is an object recognition model which has been inspired by the visual cortex, and sparse coding, which is a characteristic of neurons in the visual cortex, was previously integrated into the HMAX model for improved performance. In this study, in order to further enhance recognition accuracy, we have developed an elastic net-regularized dictionary learning approach for use in the HMAX model. We term this the En-HMAX model. With the En-HMAX model, we can exploit the sparsity-grouping tradeoff, such that correlated but informative features are preserved for object classification. Results show that the En-MAX model outperforms the original HMAX model in recognizing unseen objects by ~40% as well as the two special cases of the HMAX model, i.e., the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)-HMAX (~19%) and Ridge-HMAX (~9%) models.",2016,IEEE Signal Processing Letters

Online TTC Estimation Using Nonparametric Analytics Considering Wind Power Integration,"Total transfer capability (TTC) is an effective indicator to evaluate the transmission limit of the interconnected systems. However, due to the large-scale wind power integration, operation conditions of a power system may change rapidly, yielding time-varying characteristics of the TTC. As a result, the traditional time-consuming transient stability constrained TTC model is unable to assess the online transmission margin. In this paper, we propose an online measurement-based TTC estimator using the nonparametric analytics. It consists of three major components: the probabilistic data generation, the composite feature selection, and the group Lasso regression-based training scheme. Specifically, we present a probabilistic data generation approach to take into account the uncertainties of the day-ahead generation scheduling and to reduce the number of redundant or infeasible data. Then, the composite feature selection is used to reduce the dimension of the generated data and identify the features which are highly correlated with TTC. The features are determined by the maximal information coefficients and nonparametric independence screening approach. Finally, these selected features are trained by the group Lasso regression to learn the correlation between the TTC and the online measurements. Once real-time measurements are available, the TTC can be assessed immediately through the learned correlation relationship. Extensive numerical results carried out on the modified New England 39-bus test system demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed TTC estimator for online applications.",2019,IEEE Transactions on Power Systems
Survival prediction model for non-small cell lung cancer based on somatic mutations.,"BACKGROUND
The 5-year survival rate of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is only 15%. Screening some combined gene mutations could predict the survival of NSCLC patients, and provide new ideas for the diagnosis and treatment of NSCLC.


OBJECTIVE
To identify a signature mutations for survival prediction of NSCLC.


METHODS
The clinical and gene mutation information of 949 NSCLC patients were downloaded from TCGA. The high frequency mutation and common mutation genes were analyzed based on 1000 cancer related genes. LASSO-COX model was used to screen gene mutation points and analyze their survival, and then a survival prediction model was established. 50 NSCLC patients were collected and 1000 targeted genes were enriched by targeted next generation sequencing (NGS). The results were used to verify the combination of common mutation genes and the function of the survival model, and then to clarify the clinical significance of them.


RESULTS
Ten variables were screened out after LASSO-COX analysis, including age, tumor stage, EGFR c.[2573T>G], PIK3CA c.[1624G>A], TP53 c.[375G>T], TP53 c.[527G>T], TP53 c.[733G>T], TP53 c.[734G>T], TP53 c.[743G>T], NFE2L2 c.[100C>G]. Except for TP53 c.[743G>T] and NFE2L2 c.[100C>G], the residual six hot spot mutations of EGFR, PIK3CA and TP53 could be regarded as a signature mutations to forecast the survival time of NSCLC.

Flatfish recruitment response to decadal climatic variability and ocean conditions in the eastern Bering Sea,"This paper provides a retrospective analysis of the relationship of physical oceanography and biology and recruitment of three Eastern Bering Sea flatfish stocks: flathead sole (Hippoglossoides elassodon), northern rock sole (Lepidopsetta polyxystra), and arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias) for the period 1978â€“1996. Temporal trends in flatfish production in the Eastern Bering Sea are consistent with the hypothesis that decadal scale climate variability influences marine survival during the early life history period. Density-dependence (spawning stock size) is statistically significant in a Ricker model of flatfish recruitment, which includes environmental terms. Wind-driven advection of flatfish larvae to favorable nursery grounds was also found to coincide with years of above-average recruitment through the use of an ocean surface current simulation model (OSCURS). Ocean forcing of Bristol Bay surface waters during springtime was mostly shoreward (eastward) during the 1980s and seaward (westerly) during the 1990s, corresponding with periods of good and poor recruitment. Distance from shore and water depth at the endpoint of 90-day drift periods (estimated time of settlement) were also found to correspond with flatfish productivity.",2002,Progress in Oceanography
Segmentation and Classification of Cine-MR Images Using Fully Convolutional Networks and Handcrafted Features,"Three-dimensional cine-MRI is of crucial importance for assessing the cardiac function. Features that describe the anatomy and function of cardiac structures (e.g. Left Ventricle (LV), Right Ventricle (RV), and Myocardium(MC)) are known to have significant diagnostic value and can be computed from 3D cine-MR images. However, these features require precise segmentation of cardiac structures. Among the fully automated segmentation methods, Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN) with Skip Connections have shown robustness in medical segmentation problems. In this study, we develop a complete pipeline for classification of subjects with cardiac conditions based on 3D cine-MRI. For the segmentation task, we develop a 2D FCN and introduce Parallel Paths (PP) as a way to exploit the 3D information of the cine-MR image. For the classification task, 125 features were extracted from the segmented structures, describing their anatomy and function. Next, a two-stage pipeline for feature selection using the LASSO method is developed. A subset of 20 features is selected for classification. Each subject is classified using an ensemble of Logistic Regression, Multi-Layer Perceptron, and Support Vector Machine classifiers through majority voting. The Dice Coefficient for segmentation was 0.95+-0.03, 0.89+-0.13, and 0.90+-0.03 for LV, RV, and MC respectively. The 8-fold cross validation accuracy for the classification task was 95.05% and 92.77% based on ground truth and the proposed methods segmentations respectively. The results show that the PPs increase the segmentation accuracy, by exploiting the spatial relations. Moreover, the classification algorithm and the features showed discriminability while keeping the sensitivity to segmentation error as low as possible.",2017,ArXiv

Extended Bayesian Information Criteria for Gaussian Graphical Models,"Gaussian graphical models with sparsity in the inverse covariance matrix are of significant interest in many modern applications. For the problem of recovering the graphical structure, information criteria provide useful optimization objectives for algorithms searching through sets of graphs or for selection of tuning parameters of other methods such as the graphical lasso, which is a likelihood penalization technique. In this paper we establish the consistency of an extended Bayesian information criterion for Gaussian graphical models in a scenario where both the number of variables p and the sample size n grow. Compared to earlier work on the regression case, our treatment allows for growth in the number of non-zero parameters in the true model, which is necessary in order to cover connected graphs. We demonstrate the performance of this criterion on simulated data when used in conjunction with the graphical lasso, and verify that the criterion indeed performs better than either cross-validation or the ordinary Bayesian information criterion when p and the number of non-zero parameters q both scale with n.",2010,
ResoluciÃ³n del problema de equilibrado de lÃ­neas de montaje con mÃ¡s de un operario en cada estaciÃ³n,"El presente trabajo tiene la finalidad de resolver el problema de equilibrado de lineas de montaje conuno ovariosoperariosen cada estacion, tambien conocido como Multi-manned Assembly Line Balancing Problem (MALBP). En este problemase realizandiferentes tareas sobre la misma pieza de trabajo de manera simultanea. Aunque es un problema que seencuentra muy presente en ciertas lineas de montaje reales, existen pocos estudiosen la literatura academica. Con el objetivo de resolver el problema MALBP se ha desarrollado un procedimiento heuristico que, dadas una determinadas caracteristicas de la linea de montajecomo el tiempo de proceso de cada tarea, sus relacionesde precedencia, el tiempo de ciclo de la linea y el numero maximo de operarios posibles por estacion, realice la distribucion de las tareas a lo largo de las estaciones de trabajoy operadoresde manera que se minimicen el numero de estaciones. El procedimiento propuesto se basa en laheuristica de mejora conocida como optimizacion local. Este metodo parte de una solucion inicial, obtenida a traves de diferentes heuristicas greedy, y utilizando como idea fundamental la exploracion del vecindario con el objetivo de encontrar soluciones mejores. Con el objetivo de evaluar el funcionamiento del procedimiento de resolucion se ha realizado una experiencia computacional a partir de un conjunto de ejemplares de testeo. Estos ejemplares se han obtenido de unbanco de datos dirigido a la resolucion de problemas de equilibrado de lineas. Finalmente, se ha hecho una comparativa entre lassolucionesobtenidasa traves de la aplicacion de la optimizacion local y lassolucionesque se presentaron en el estudio de Dimitriadis (2006).

Insertion Mutagenesis of thePseudomonas aeruginosa,"The gene encoding thePseudomonas aeruginosaphosphate-specific porin OprP was subjected to both linker and epitope insertion mutageneses. Nine of the 13 linker mutant genes expressed protein at levels comparable to those obtained with the wild-type gene. These mutant proteins were shown, by indirect immunofluorescence with an OprP-specific antiserum, to be properly exposed at the cell surface. Four of the linker mutant genes expressed protein at reduced levels which were not detectable at the cell surface. A foreign epitope from the circumsporozoite form of the malarial parasitePlasmodium falciparumwas cloned into the linker sites of 12 of the 13 mutant genes. Seven of the resultant epitope insertion mutant genes expressed surface-exposed protein. Two of these mutant genes presented the foreign epitope at surface-accessible regions as assessed by indirect immunofluorescence with a malarial epitope-specific monoclonal antibody. The data from these experiments were used to create a topological model of the OprP monomer. The transport of hydrophilic molecules across the outer membranesofgram-negativebacteriaisfacilitatedbyaclassof proteins known as porins. These proteins form water-filled, membrane-spanning channels which permit the passage of molecules through the membrane and into the periplasmic space (13). Porins have been divided into two categories, nonspecific or general diffusion porins and specific porins (29, 30). General diffusion porins allow the passage of any hydrophilic moleculethroughtheirchannelsprovideditissmallerthanthe channelsâ€™ exclusion limit. Specific porins possess a substratebinding site which makes it possible, at rate-limiting concentrations, for them to transport molecules that bind to that site atamuchhigherratethanothermoleculesofcomparablesize. The structures of a number of general diffusion porins have been determined by both crystallographic (12, 40) and mutagenic (5, 10) techniques. They are composed of three identical subunits, each of which is a 16-stranded b-barrel. The b-strands are tilted at an angle with respect to the plane of the membrane and are connected by loops exposed to either the outer surface or the periplasmic space. The periplasmically exposed loops tend to be short and regular, while the surface-exposed loops are longer and more variable. The third surface loop actually folds back into the channel so as to constrict its internal diameter (12). While there exists a great deal of data regarding the structure of general porins, there is considerably less information pertainingtothestructureofspecificporins.Thelistofspecific",1995,
Are macrolides now obligatory in severe community-acquired pneumonia?,"In this issue of Intensive Care Medicine, Martin-Loechesand colleagues [1] present an analysis of a cohort of 218patients with community-acquired pneumonia requiringmechanical ventilation enrolled into a larger, observa-tional, multi-center European study. The major ï¬nding ofthe study in this issue was that the 42 patients whoreceived a macrolide antibiotic had half the mortality rateof other patients after adjusting for severity of illness atpresentation.That macrolide antibiotics appear to confer a signiï¬-cant survival advantage in patients with severecommunity-acquired pneumonia is not a new concept,with multiple observational and retrospective studiesdemonstrating substantial mortality beneï¬ts [2â€“7]. How-ever, as has been pointed out in many editorials andreviews, none of these studies are prospective, random-ized controlled trials. In the absence of scientiï¬callyirrefutable evidence, at what point does the weight of datain favor of using macrolides become so overwhelmingthat their use is obligatory?If we look at the potential downsides of making mac-rolides obligatory, then there is an obvious economic costif they are not needed. However, relative to most costs inhealth care, the economic burden is trivial. Unnecessarymacrolide use could perceivably contribute to increasedantibiotic resistance to this class of antibiotics in thecommunity, but the reality is that patients hospitalizedwith community-acquired pneumonia account for a min-ute portion of total antibiotic use, and this is not asustainable argument given the already widespread use ofthis class of agents in the outpatient setting for upper andlower respiratory tract infections. Overuse of macrolides,like any antibiotic, could theoretically lead to selectionfor multi-resistant pathogens. However, the risk of thisseems to be smaller than for broad-spectrum beta-lactams,third-generation cephalosporins and ï¬‚uroquinolones,which all have well-documented track records of thisadverse side effect. As with all antibiotics, drug reactionscan occur, but macrolides are generally a very safe classof antibiotics. An increased incidence of arrhythmias hasbeen reported with macrolides because of prolongation ofthe Q-T interval, but overall the risk is no greater than thatassociated with ï¬‚uroquinolones [8].If there is no major downside to adding a macrolide,the next question is whether these are the best agents orwhether other antibiotics or antibiotic combinations havean equivalent or greater beneï¬cial effect. One of theproposed (and I think the least likely) potential explana-tions for the beneï¬t of macrolides is coveringunrecognized â€˜atypicalâ€™ pathogens (such as Legionellaspp. or Mycoplasma). If this were the mechanism, thenthere should be equivalent beneï¬t from ï¬‚uroquinolonesand tetracyclines. However, just as previous observationalstudies have shown [9, 10], the current study by Martin-Loeches and colleagues [1] also clearly demonstrates thatï¬‚uroquinolones do not give the same apparent protectiveeffect as macrolides. Although much more limited, thereare also some data suggesting that tetracyclines are alsonot as efï¬cacious as macrolides [10].That the beneï¬t of macrolides is almost certainly notdriven by undiagnosed atypical pathogens invalidates the",2009,Intensive Care Medicine
Stability estimate for a multidimensional inverse spectral problem with partial spectral data,"Abstract In Bellassoued, Choulli and Yamamoto (2009) [4] we proved a logâ€“log type stability estimate for a multidimensional inverse spectral problem with partial spectral data for a Schrodinger operator, provided that the potential is known in a small neighbourhood of the boundary of the domain. In the present paper we discuss the same inverse problem. We show a log type stability estimate under an additional condition on potentials in terms of their X-ray transform. In proving our result, we follow the same method as in Alessandrini and Sylvester (1990) [1] and Bellassoued, Choulli and Yamamoto (2009) [4] . That is we relate the stability estimate for our inverse spectral problem to a stability estimate for an inverse problem consisting in the determination of the potential in a wave equation from a local Dirichlet to Neumann map (DN map in short).",2011,Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications
Detecting stock market bubbles based on the cross-sectional dispersion of stock prices,"A statistical method is proposed for detecting stock market bubbles that occur when speculative funds concentrate on a small set of stocks. The bubble is defined by stock price diverging from the fundamentals. A firmâ€™s financial standing is certainly a key fundamental attribute of that firm. The law of one price would dictate that firms of similar financial standing share similar fundamentals. We investigate the variation in market capitalization normalized by fundamentals that is estimated by Lasso regression of a firmâ€™s financial standing. The market capitalization distribution has a substantially heavier upper tail during bubble periods, namely, the market capitalization gap opens up in a small subset of firms with similar fundamentals. This phenomenon suggests that speculative funds concentrate in this subset. We demonstrated that this phenomenon could have been used to detect the dot-com bubble of 1998â€“2000 in different stock exchanges.",2019,
Initial Ideals of Pfaffian Ideals,"We resolve a conjecture about a class of binomial initial ideals of $I_{2,n}$, the ideal of the Grassmannian, Gr$(2,\mathbb{C}^n$), which are associated to phylogenetic trees. For a weight vector $\omega$ in the tropical Grassmannian, $in_\omega(I_{2,n}) = J_\mathcal{T}$ is the ideal associated to the tree $\mathcal{T}$. The ideal generated by the $2r \times 2r$ subpfaffians of a generic $n \times n$ skew-symmetric matrix is precisely $I_{2,n}^{\{r-1\}}$, the $(r-1)$-secant of $I_{2,n}$. We prove necessary and sufficient conditions on the topology of $\mathcal{T}$ in order for $in_\omega(I_{2,n})^{\{2\}} = J_\mathcal{T}^{\{2\}}$. We also give a new classof prime initial ideals of the Pfaffian ideals.",2016,arXiv: Algebraic Geometry
Grundlage fÃ¼r eine Beurteilung des Transmissionsrisikos von Fasciola hepatica,"Die Fasciolose, ausgelost durch eine Infestation mit dem Grosen Leberegel, Fasciola hepatica, gilt weltweit als Ursache erheblicher wirtschaftlicher Verluste durch die meist chronisch verlaufende Erkrankung bei Rindern. Um Regionen, in denen ein erhohtes Risiko fur die Ubertragung von Fasciola hepatica besteht, fruhzeitig erkennen zu konnen, bedarf es eines geeigneten raumlichen Modelles, welches alle Schritte der Transmission berucksichtigt. 
Gegenstand der vorliegenden Arbeit war es, ein geeignetes Regressionsmodell zu entwickeln, das zur Vorhersage des Vorkommens von Galba truncatula, der Zwergschlammschnecke, befahigen sollte. Diese ist in vielen Landern, so auch in der Schweiz, Zwischenwirt fur den Grosen Leberegel. 
Insgesamt wurde der potenzielle Einfluss von 70 Kovariablen auf die Wahrscheinlichkeit Ï€_i, Galba truncatula an einem Ort vorzufinden, untersucht. Als Datenbasis dienten dabei n=242 Gelandepunkte, die in den Jahren 1999-2000, 2004 und 2010 von G. Knubben-Schweizer sowie R. Baggenstos auf das Vorhandensein von Zwergschlammschnecken uberpruft worden waren. 
Der binare Response (Schnecken ja/ nein) erforderte die Verwendung Generalisierter Linearer (Gemischter) Regressionsmodelle (GL(M)Ms). Im Speziellen kamen zwei Regressionsverfahren in Form binarer Logitmodelle zur Anwendung: Das grplasso-Verfahren und ein glmmLasso-Modell, die beide als gleichnamige Pakete im Statistikprogramm R implementiert sind. Das Ausmas der Penalisierung einzelner Koeffizienten und die Sparsamkeit der Modelle wurde durch 10-fache Kreuzvalidierung beziehungsweise das sogenannte Bayessche Informationskriterium gesteuert. 
Es ergaben sich zwei Modelle, die eine Vorhersage des Auftretens von Galba truncatula ermoglichen sollten. 
Im grplasso-Modell wurden 19 Kovariablen mit unterschiedlich starken Einflussen auf das Schneckenvorkommen ausgewahlt, wahrend via glmmLasso-Modell nur 13 Kovariablen als relevant erkannt wurden, seine Verwendung im Gegenzug aber die Berucksichtigung standortspezifischer Effekte, sogenannter random effects, erlaubte. Beide Modelle stimmten in neun Kovariablen uberein, denen damit die ausgepragtesten Effekte auf die Schneckenpopulation beigemessen werden mussen. Riete beziehungsweise Feuchtflachen, Hangwasseraustritte, Gewasser im Umkreis von 100 Metern und Baumbestand stellten ebenso positive Pradiktoren dar wie eine mittlere im Vergleich zu tiefer Grundigkeit des Bodens. Negative Pradiktoren waren insbesondere gehaufte Uberschreitungen hoher Temperaturen von 30 Â°C und Unterschreitungen von 0 Â°C. Bodennah gemessene Temperaturen wurden bevorzugt selektiert und schienen die entscheidenden Temperaturverhaltnisse besser widerzuspiegeln als makroklimatische Parameter. Niederschlagsabhangigen Kovariablen wurden weder im grplasso- noch im glmmLasso-Modell relevante Einflusse zugebilligt. Sie durften auf Grund ausreichend starker Niederschlage in den betrachteten Klimaregionen der nordostlichen Schweiz keinen limitierenden Faktor fur das Auftreten von Galba truncatula darstellen. 
Jedes der beiden Regressionsverfahren kann als geeignete Methode zur Vorhersage des Vorkommens von Galba truncatula dienen, wobei die Schatzungen des glmmLasso-Modelles stabiler gegenuber datenstrukturbedingten Einflussen zu sein scheinen. 
Eine Validierung der Schatzgenauigkeit beider Modelle anhand neuer, unbekannter Stichproben steht aus. Doch lassen sich aus der vorliegenden Arbeit Empfehlungen fur die Methodik zukunftiger Transmissionsmodelle zur Fasciolose in der Schweiz ableiten.",2016,
Sound Field Reproduction using the Lasso,"Reproducing a sampled sound field using an array of loudspeakers is a problem with well-appreciated applications to acoustics and ultrasound treatment. Loudspeaker signal design has traditionally relied on (possibly regularized) least-squares (LS) criteria. In many cases however, the desired sound field can be reproduced using only a few loudspeakers, which are sparsely distributed in space. To exploit this feature, the fresh look advocated here permeates benefits from advances in variable selection and compressive sampling to sound field synthesis by formulating a sparse linear regression problem that is solved using the least-absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso). An efficient implementation of the Lasso for the problem at hand is developed based on a coordinate descent iteration. Analysis and simulations demonstrate that Lasso-based sound field reproduction yields better performance than LS especially at high frequencies and for reproduction of under-sampled sound fields. In addition, Lasso-based synthesis enables judicious placement of loudspeaker arrays.",2010,"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing"

Acute axonal neuropathy and Wernickeâ€™s encephalopathy,"Sirs: Wernickeâ€™s Encephalopathy (WE) and peripheral neuropathy (PN) are common clinical manifestations of alcohol abuse [1, 2]. Typically, WE has an acute, rapidly progressive course whereas alcohol-associated PN is a chronic, slowly progressive disease. However, an acute course of alcoholassociated PN has recently been reported and related to thiamine deficiency which also yields WE [1, 2, 9]. Here, we report a case of an alcoholic patient with simultaneous manifestation of WE and acute axonal PN with severe autonomic dysfunction. The simultaneous manifestation of both conditions together with a low thiamine serum level provides support for a critical role of thiamine deficiency in acute alcoholassociated axonal PN. A 43-year-old obese woman in a good general condition presented with gait impairment, muscle weakness and numbness of both legs. Symptoms had started ten days earlier and progressed over the last 72 hours. During the past years she drank at least 1â€“2 bottles of wine per day. Preceding gastrointestinal or airway infection was denied. Neurological examination revealed a severe flaccid tetraparesis with decreased tendon reflexes as well as hypesthesia and reduced vibration sense in the lower extremities. The patient was unable to stand or walk. Cranial nerve examination revealed an upbeat nystagmus and esotropia. Neuropsychological evaluation showed confabulation with fluctuating deficits in orientation and short term memory. Laboratory tests revealed megaloblastic anemia (hemoglobin 11.1 g/l, MCV 103.9 fl, MCH 35.8 pg) elevation of liver enzymes (AST 95 U/l, ALT 74 U/l, cGT 210 U/l), creatinkinase (644 U/l) and CRP (5.8 mg/dL) which was due to an urinary tract infection confirmed by urinanalysis. Thiamine levels were significantly decreased (<1.1 lg/l) and slightly decreased for vitamine B6 (2.3 lg/ l) and folate (2.6 ng/ml), vitamine B12 and B2 were within the normal range. CSF was unremarkable except for a high lactate level (4.6 mmol/l). Cranial MRI scan showed hyperintense corpora mammillaria on FLAIR weighted images (Figure 1). Nerve conduction studies revealed a severe axonal neuropathy with a marked decrease of compound muscle action potential and slightly reduced nerve conduction velocity of the tibial nerve. Sensory nerve action potentials of the sural nerve were absent and markedly reduced in the median and ulnar nerve. Electromyography showed abnormal spontaneous activity in proximal and distal muscles of the upper and lower extremities. Variability of heart frequency was greatly reduced, indicating autonomic dysfunction. WE and acute axonal PN were diagnosed and the patient immediately received thiamine intravenously. During the following days oculomotor deficits resolved. However, neuropsychological deficits and muscle weakness remained unchanged despite administration of thiamine and intravenous immune globuline. On hospital day 8, the patientâ€™s general condition rapidly deteriorated along with progressive respiratory failure. During intubation, it became necessary to remove several litres of fluid from the stomach, apparently because of gastroparesis. Despite intensive care treatment the patient died the same day from sepsis with respiratory failure. Here, we report the simultaneous manifestation of WE and acute axonal PN with autonomic dysfunction in an alcoholic patient. Chronic courses of PN, WE and thiamine deficiency are wellknown complications of chronic alcohol abuse [1, 2] Acute, rapidly progressive manifestations of alcohol-associated PN with [3, 4] or without WE [4â€“7] have also been recognized but are far less common than chronic manifestations. Ishibashi and colleagues described three cases of acute axonal PN associated with WE [3].
