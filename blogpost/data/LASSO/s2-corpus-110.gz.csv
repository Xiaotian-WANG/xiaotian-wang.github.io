Inflammation drives an altered phenotype of mucosal-associated invariant T cells in chronic hepatitis D virus infection.,"Patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection are at risk of superinfection with the Hepatitis D virus (HDV), a small circular RNA virus that uses the HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) to envelope its genome and infect hepatocytes. Superinfection with HDV increases the severity of viral hepatitis, accelerates the progression to cirrhosis and increases the risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma. This process is thought to be immune-mediated, but the factors that drive disease pathogenesis are not well understood. Tools to study the role of CD8 T cells in chronic HDV infection only recently became available when a comprehensive set of CD8 T cell epitopes was identified in 3 independent publications. These studies also revealed the presence of HDV mutations in both individual patients and at the population level. HDV mutations were associated with a memory-like phenotype of the corresponding CD8 T cells, consistent with the notion that stimulation via their HDV-specific T cell receptor (TCR) had ceased. These findings imply that alternative mechanisms of immune cell activation may contribute to liver disease pathogenesis. Indeed, HDV but not HBV results in vigorous innate immune responses such as interferon (IFN)-b and IFN-k-mediated induction of interferon-stimulated genes. Innate immune cells with constitutively high expression of receptors for IFN-a/b and/or other inflammatory cytokines such as IL-12 and IL-18 constitute a large part of the intrahepatic infiltrate, even in the healthy liver. Of particular interest are mucosalassociated invariant T (MAIT) cells which comprise up to 40% of the intrahepatic immune cell population, even in the healthy liver. MAIT cells are innate-like T cells, typically identified by their expression of the C-type lectin CD161 and a semi-invariant TCR with conserved Va7.2 chain. They are stimulated in a TCRdependent manner by bacterial metabolites that are presented by the non-classical, monomorphic major histocompatibility",2019,Journal of hepatology

Spazio ai giovani : metaprogetto per la residenza del nuovo polo universitario di Aosta,"""Dalla citta dei Pretoriani alla citta degli studenti..."" 
Fondata dai soldati pretoriani nel 25 a.C. con il nome di Augusta Praetoria Salassorum, la citta di Aosta e un piccolo centro urbano, situato nel cuore della piana centrale di una vallata delle Alpi occidentali. 
Attualmente capoluogo di regione, il nucleo abitato subi durante i due millenni di vita una trasformazione territoriale e morfologica che ha modificato l'aspetto dell'intera piana e del suo ruolo rispetto del panorama esterno. 
Fin dalle sue origini, Aosta ebbe un ruolo di rilievo grazie alla posizione strategica in cui e collocata, al centro dei due punti di attraversamento dell'arco alpino costituiti dai valichi dell'Alpis Graia e dellâ€™Alpis Pennino, attualmente denominati colle del Piccolo e del Gran San Bernardo. Questa particolare ubicazione geografica determino l'assunzione del ruolo di punto di transito viario, che la citta mantenne nei secoli successivi come predominante a causa delle inadeguate condizioni fisiche per lo sviluppo di un sistema agricolo - produttivo. 
Vista la posizione geografica e la particolare conformazione morfologica dell'arduo territorio montuoso, l'espansione planimetrica della citta segui criteri legati al territorio circostante, che racchiusero il nucleo tra l'area collinare settentrionale e l'area fluviale dovuta al passaggio della Dora Baltea nel meridione del fondovalle. Lo sviluppo urbano pone le sue origini nell'esiguo impianto a castrum romano, che rimase quasi invariato nei secoli successivi, delimitando i confini del nucleo originario, chiamato C/fe durante il periodo medioevale, contraddistinguendolo dalle piccole espansioni dovute ai nuovi poli oltre alle mura romane. Il vero e proprio fenomeno di espansione urbana inizio solo all'inizio del XX secolo, durante il quale Aosta fu la protagonista di una trasformazione dettata dallo sviluppo del nucleo industriale degli anni Venti e dal boom economico del secondo dopoguerra. 
La realta territoriale attuale e frutto di queste ultime espansioni disordinate, che non seguirono le direttive proposte dagli strumenti urbanistici del secolo scorso. L'aggregato cittadino odierno e assimilabile a una conurbazione territoriale ben marcata al centro della vallata principale, con la creazione di un continuum urbano grazie all'eliminazione dei confini fisici con i comuni di confine. 
A seguito di queste significative espansioni, che portarono alla saturazione dell'intero territorio comunale, rimase una cesura interna nell'area divenuta ormai il cuore del tessuto urbano aostano. Si tratta dello spazio occupato dalla Caserma Testafochi, storico complesso dell'ordine degli Alpini, edificato alla fine del XIX secolo, appena al di fuori del confine romano ovest dove gia in passato durante l'epoca medioevale era adibito alla funzione di deposito armi. Questo nucleo fu uno dei primi che si stanziarono al di fuori del confine romano ovest, che a causa della sua funzione e della configurazione chiusa dell'edificato divenne all'inizio del XX secolo uno spazio urbano isolato e inaccessibile da parte dei cittadini aostani. Ai giorni nostri, la Caserma risulta ormai priva della sua ragione d'essere, in quanto il continuo decremento del numero dei soldati presenti la rende quasi inutilizzata. 
La Variante del 2000 del Piano Regolatore individua l'area della Caserma come Area della Trasformazione Urbana di Pubblico Interesse, assegnandole la nuova funzione di polo universitario. La scelta ricade sulla scia di un fenomeno comune ad altri centri abitati d'Italia, nei quali, come ad Aosta, sono presenti grandi complessi militari oramai inutilizzati ancora in buono stato, predisponendo la riconversione di questi ultimi a residenze universitarie. 
La Variante successiva del marzo 2010 individua nell'art. 27 l'area come Zona F- IMPIANTI ED ATTREZZATURE DI INTERESSE GENERALE, rappresentando poli di concentrazione dei servizi. In particolare la superficie di progetto rientra nella categoria delle sottozone territoriali Fa (attrezzature di rilevanza regionale), denominata Fa06 Caserma Testafochi. 
L'Universita degli Studi della Valle d'Aosta, nata all'inizio del 2000 e in continua crescita, necessita di una nuova sede, in quanto e attualmente frammentata in 
diversi stabili inadeguati per le attivita e per l'amministrazione dell'intero ateneo. Il progetto di riconversione va oltre il semplice spostamento di sede, proponendo un vero e proprio campus universitario che potra ospitare al suo interno numerosi studenti, creando una nuova dimensione all'interno della citta. 
L'approccio metodologico scelto per la progettazione e l'inserimento della nuova residenza all'interno del contesto urbano pone il suo punto di inizio da un'analisi dei sistemi urbani e della stratificazione di questi all'interno dell'attuale citta di Aosta, con particolare attenzione allo sviluppo pianimetrico dell'area di progetto durante i secoli. 
Il passo successivo e stato quello di prendere in considerazione l'area nella sua dimensione presente, subordinata all'ultima Variante del Piano Regolatore 2010, mettendo in rilievo le forme e l'arredo urbano che la caratterizzano sia al suo interno che negli isolati circostanti, evidenziando le potenzialita e le criticita. 
In base alle analisi preliminari svolte sul contesto urbano di Aosta, e a un approfondimento sulla tipologia della residenza universitaria, sono stati cosi determinati il volume del nuovo edificio e l'inserimento di questo all'interno dell'area di trasformazione. Il nuovo edificio e stato pensato per far fronte alle esigenze della nuova funzione alla quale verra adibito, tenendo conto dei servizi da inserire o da potenziare rispetto a quelli gia presenti nell'area. Una particolare attenzione e stata posta inoltre alla realizzazione di un progetto cromatico dei vari ambienti, con il fine ultimo di garantire un maggiore comfort e benessere per la vita all'interno della residenza.",2013,
Analisi di fragilitÃ  di tamponamenti in muratura soggetti ad azioni sismiche nel piano e fuori piano = Fragility analysis of masonry infills subject to seismic actions in-plane and out-of-plane,"Questa tesi si pone come obiettivo lâ€™analisi della fragilita dei tamponamenti in muratura soggetti ad azioni simiche applicate nel piano e fuori piano. Nella prima parte dellâ€™elaborato viene messa in evidenza lâ€™influenza che i tamponamenti in muratura hanno sulla risposta simica strutturale del contesto edilizio in cui risultano essere inseriti. Sono state quindi descritte le modalita di comportamento dei tamponamenti in muratura quando questi sono soggetti ad azioni nel piano e fuori piano, focalizzando lâ€™attenzione sui meccanismi resistenti che il sistema e in grado di sviluppare. Successivamente e stato condotto un piccolo excursus normativo, in cui sono stati sottolineati gli aspetti fondamentali richiamati dalla normativa italiana attualmente in vigore e dagli Eurocodici in materia di tamponamenti in muratura. A questa prima parte fa seguito la parte di implementazione del modello sul software di calcolo OpenSees. Il modello a cui ci si e ispirati e il macromodello a quattro bielle equivalenti proposto da Di Trapani et al. (2018) il quale si e mostrato in grado di cogliere sia il comportamento nel piano che il comportamento fuori piano dei telai tamponati in muratura. Mediante opportune operazioni di calibrazione e stata definita la massa da assegnare al sistema per poter cogliere in maniera ottimale il comportamento reale del tamponamento quando questo veniva sollecitato dalle azioni inerziali indotte da un evento sismico. Nel tentativo di simulare il contesto strutturale in cui questi tamponamenti potevano venirsi a trovare, sono state collocate in corrispondenza dei quattro vertici del telaio, delle molle elastiche. Assegnando a queste molle elastiche diversi valori di rigidezza e stato possibile analizzare, con un unico modello di tamponamento isolato, il comportamento che questo veniva ad avere in contesti strutturali differenti. Una volta calibrato, il modello in questione e stato sottoposto ad una approfondita serie di analisi dinamiche incrementali, grazie alle quali e stato possibile tracciare le cosiddette curve IDA. Le stesse analisi dinamiche incrementali sono state condotte su campioni soggetti a diversi livelli di pre-danneggiamento nel piano ottenuto applicando al sistema dei cicli di carico nel piano a spostamento massimo imposto. Sulla base delle curve IDA ottenute per tutti questi modelli, sono state tracciate le curve di fragilita grazie alle quali e stato possibile descrivere in maniera efficace il legame che sussiste tra resistenza nel piano e fuori piano e analizzare un eventuale trend di comportamento al variare della rigidezza delle molle. Si e infatti osservato che la fragilita sismica dei tamponamenti in muratura non solo dipende dalle proprieta meccaniche e geometriche del pannello, ma dipende anche dal rapporto di rigidezza che sussiste tra il pannello e il telaio. I dati sperimentali evidenziano infatti come esistano dei rapporti di rigidezza piu problematici di altri. Inoltre sulla base dei risultati ottenuti e stato possibile affermare come il pre-danneggiamento causato dai cicli nel piano riducano notevolmente la rigidezza fuori piano del pannello stesso, rendendolo quindi piu predisposto al collasso in caso di eventi sismici. Infine sono state condotte una serie di analisi dinamiche su un telaio multipiano in c.a. tamponato nel tentativo di cercare un riscontro pratico dei risultati ottenuti con lâ€™analisi di fragilita del pannello isolato.",2019,
Response of Pulmonary Vein Potentials to Burst Pacing,"AbstractBackground: Pulmonary vein potentials recorded at the ostia of pulmonary veins (PV) are a useful guide for segmental isolation of the PV in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Even during coronary sinus pacing at 600 ms, atrial (A) and PV potentials can overlap in 50â€“60% of patients making the accurate identification of PV potentials very difficult.
Methods: Nineteen patients (M:F 15:4) with paroxysmal AF underwent segmental isolation of one or more PV. Coronary sinus (CS) pacing was performed at cycle lengths of 600/550/500/450/400/350/300 ms and bipolar electrograms were recorded from the 10 or 20 pole Lasso catheter placed at the atrial-PV junction in 27 pulmonary veins. Stimulus (S) to A, S-PVP and A-PVP intervals were measured during CS pacing at the different cycle lengths at sweep speed of 200 mm/sec.
Results: During CS pacing at 600 ms the A and PV potentials were significantly overlapped (A-PVP â‰¤ 25 ms) in 15 of 27 (55%) veins. During pacing at 300 ms, the A and PV potentials were significantly separated (A-PVP â‰¥ 25 ms) in 9 of the 15 veins where A and PV potentials overlapped and 21 of all 27 (78%) veins. In two patients pacing at 300 ms was associated with 2:1 conduction block from atrial to PV fascicle.
Conclusions: Coronary sinus pacing at cycle length of 300 ms demonstrated better separation of A and PV potentials compared to pacing at 600 ms. This strategy is easier and less time consuming compared to extrastimuli testing. It also confirms that the electrophysiological properties of PV fascicles are different from that of the adjacent atrial musculature.",2004,Journal of Interventional Cardiac Electrophysiology

Surgical Reconstruction of Intrinsic Muscle Function in Tetraplegia : Comparison of Techniques,"The aim of this study was to analyze the contribution of the intrinsics (INT) to a functional hand closing and to compare the results of two INT reconstruction techniques (ZancolliLasso and House procedures). Kinematics of cadaveric hands during hand closing (FDP tendon pulled by a motor) were analyzed at following conditions: no activation of INT, high activation of INT and reconstruction of INT by Zancolli-Lasso or House technique. The results showed that INT activation results in a more functional hand closing represented by a larger fingertip-topalm distance. Both reconstruction techniques showed improved grasp capacity in comparison to the nonreconstructed hand. However, only the House procedure restored hand kinematics resembling those of an active INT hand.",2013,
Computational design of the lasso peptide antibiotic microcin J25.,"Microcin J25 (MccJ25) is a 21 amino acid (aa) ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptide with an unusual structure in which the eight N-terminal residues form a covalently cyclized macrolactam ring through which the remaining 13 aa tail is fed. An open question is the extent of sequence space that can occupy such an extraordinary, highly constrained peptide fold. To begin answering this question, here we have undertaken a computational redesign of the MccJ25 peptide using a two-stage sequence selection procedure based on both energy minimization and fold specificity. Eight of the most highly ranked sequences from the design algorithm, each of which contained two or three amino acid substitutions, were expressed in Escherichia coli and tested for production and antimicrobial activity. Six of the eight variants were successfully produced by E.coli at production levels comparable with that of the wild-type peptide. Of these six variants, three retain detectable antimicrobial activity, although this activity is reduced relative to wild-type MccJ25. The results here build upon previous findings that even rigid, constrained structures like the lasso architecture are amenable to redesign. Furthermore, this work provides evidence that a large amount of amino acid variation is tolerated by the lasso peptide fold.",2011,"Protein engineering, design & selection : PEDS"
Multilevel Heterogeneous Factor Analysis and Application to Ecological Momentary Assessment.,"Ansari et al. (Psychometrika 67:49-77, 2002) applied a multilevel heterogeneous model for confirmatory factor analysis to repeated measurements on individuals. While the mean and factor loadings in this model vary across individuals, its factor structure is invariant. Allowing the individual-level residuals to be correlated is an important means to alleviate the restriction imposed by configural invariance. We relax the diagonality assumption of residual covariance matrix and estimate it using a formal Bayesian Lasso method. The approach improves goodness of fit and avoids ad hoc one-at-a-time manipulation of entries in the covariance matrix via modification indexes. We illustrate the approach using simulation studies and real data from an ecological momentary assessment.",2019,Psychometrika
"ProspecciÃ³n EcolÃ³gica Del Manglar Y Praderas Marinas Como HÃ¡bitats De CrÃ­a Para Peces Arrecifales En San AndrÃ©s Isla, Caribe Insular Colombiano*","The structure of the ichthyofauna associated to an area of mangrove swamp and two areas of seagrass beds was evaluated in San Andres Island (Biosphere Reserve Seaflower) to determine the character of nursery of those ecosystems. The composition, abundance, and development state of fishes in each biotope was evaluated using visual censuses in band transects during the rainy season. A total abundance of 1908, mainly young (98%), specimens was counted. A richness of 27 species, 18 genus, and 13 families, a Shannon's index of 2.0, a dominance of 0.22 and an equitability of 0.61 were found. Richness was higher at the seagrass (20 species) than at the mangrove (13 species); abundance was higher in the mangrove (1.86 ind/m2); and the largest diversity was found in a meadow associated to mangroves (H = 2.23). The nature of the mangrove and seagrasses as nursery habitats was determined as well as their combined functionality when they are close to each other. The high potential as connecting species between nursery habitats and coral reefs of Abudefduf saxatilis, Acanthurus chirurgus, Chaetodon capistratus, Gerres cinereus, Haemulon flavolineatum, Haemulon sciurus, Halichoeres bivittatus, H. poeyi, Lutjanus apodus, Scarus iseri, Sparisoma viride, Thalassoma bifasciatum, of the species of genera Eucinostomus and Stegastes, and of two morphotypes of Clupeidae was determined, given their relatively high densities of juvenile in the swamp and seagrass beds. Depth changed moderately among habitats (about one meter) showing positive correlation with oxygen (0.84). pH and temperature were correlated negatively (0.93). Density of mangrove roots is low compared to other Caribbean localities (11.7 Â± 4.0 roots/m2). Length of Thalassia testudinum leaves varied significantly between seagrass beds and their covering was higher than other substrates in the seagrass beds. The remarkable diversity and density of economically important fish species, the particular configurations of the biotopes, and the status of interconnection or isolation between mangroves and seagrass beds, suggest the relevancy of the structural and functional protection of these habitats. The results agree with the literature and enrich it, and are input for the management of the resources in Seaflower.",2012,
Sparse approximate solution of fitting surface to scattered points by MLASSO model,"The goal of this paper is to achieve a computational model and corresponding efficient algorithm for obtaining a sparse representation of the fitting surface to the given scattered data. The basic idea of the model is to utilize the principal shift invariant (PSI) space and the l1 norm minimization. In order to obtain different sparsity of the approximation solution, the problem is represented as a multilevel LASSO (MLASSO) model with different regularization parameters. The MLASSO model can be solved efficiently by the alternating direction method of multipliers. Numerical experiments indicate that compared to the AGLASSO model and the basic MBA algorithm, the MLASSO model can provide an acceptable compromise between the minimization of the data mismatch term and the sparsity of the solution. Moreover, the solution by the MLASSO model can reflect the regions of the underlying surface where high gradients occur.",2017,Science China Mathematics
The discovery of deep-water seagrass meadows in a pristine Indian Ocean wilderness revealed by tracking green turtles,"Our understanding of global seagrass ecosystems comes largely from regions characterized by human impacts with limited data from habitats defined as notionally pristine. Seagrass assessments also largely focus on shallow-water coastal habitats with comparatively few studies on offshore deep-water seagrasses. We satellite tracked green turtles (Chelonia mydas), which are known to forage on seagrasses, to a remote, pristine deepwater environment in the Western Indian Ocean, the Great Chagos Bank, which lies in the heart of one of the world's largest marine protected areas (MPAs). Subsequently we used in-situ SCUBA and baited video surveys to survey the day-time sites occupied by turtles and discovered extensive monospecific seagrass meadows of Thalassodendron ciliatum. At three sites that extended over 128 km, mean seagrass cover was 74% (mean range 67â€“88% across the 3 sites at depths to 29m. The mean species richness of fish in seagrass meadows was 11 species per site (mean range 8â€“14 across the 3 sites). High fish abundance (e.g. Siganus sutor: mean MaxN.site= 38.0, SD=53.7, n=5) and large predatory shark (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos) (mean MaxN.site= 1.5, SD=0.4, n=5) were recorded at all sites. Such observations of seagrass meadows with large top predators, are limited in the literature. Given that the Great Chagos Bank extends over approximately 12,500 km and many other large deep submerged banks exist across the world's oceans, our results suggest that deep-water seagrass may be far more abundant than previously suspected.",2018,
CT-based radiomic signatures for prediction of pathologic complete response in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy,"The objective of this study was to build models to predict complete pathologic response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients using radiomic features. A total of 55 consecutive patients pathologically diagnosed as having ESCC were included in this study. Patients were divided into a training cohort (44 patients) and a testing cohort (11 patients). The logistic regression analysis using likelihood ratio forward selection was performed to select the predictive clinical parameters for pCR, and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) with logistic regression to select radiomic predictors in the training cohort. Model performance in the training and testing groups was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC). The multivariate logistic regression analysis identified no clinical predictors for pCR. Thus, only radiomic features selected by LASSO were used to build prediction models. Three logistic regression models for pCR prediction were developed in the training cohort, and they were able to predict pCR well in both the training (AUC, 0.84-0.86) and the testing cohorts (AUC, 0.71-0.79). There were no differences between these AUCs. We developed three predictive models for pCR after nCRT using radiomic parameters and they demonstrated good model performance.",2019,Journal of Radiation Research
Robustness of Bayesian multilocus association models to cryptic relatedness.,"Population-based association analyses are more powerful than within-family analyses in identifying genetic loci associated with a phenotype of interest. However, if the population or sample structure is omitted from the model, population stratification and cryptic relatedness may lead to false positive and negative signals caused by relatedness between individuals, rather than association due to close linkage of the marker and the trait loci. Therefore it is important to correct or account for these confounders in population-based association analyses. However, there is cumulative evidence that when fitting a multilocus association model, the genetic relationships between the individuals can be captured by the markers themselves, bringing about a possibility to use the models without an additional correction for the population or sample structure. In this work we have further investigated this possibility in the Bayesian multilocus association model context using the extended Bayesian LASSO and the indicator-based variable selection. In particular, we have studied whether these multilocus models benefit from an insertion of an additional polygenic term representing the genetic variation not captured by the markers and taking account of the residual dependencies between the individuals. We have found that although the models may benefit from the insertion of the polygenic component, omitting the component does not damage the model performance severely.",2012,Annals of human genetics
"Unexpected conformational conse- quences of weak hydrogen bonds on 1,3,7,9,13,15,19,21-octaazapenta- cyclo[19.3.1.1.1.1]octa- cosane monohydrate","Polyaza macrocyclic compounds with tetrahedrally arranged nitrogen lone-pair orbitals (LPOs) have been exploited for complexation with ions (Mazloum et al., 2002). Some of these compounds have attracted intense attention due to their molecular diamond lattice conformation. In fact, both theoretical (Galasso et al., 2001) and experimental studies (Dale et al., 1991, 1992) of the molecular structures and spectroscopic properties of this class of compounds have been reported. The results of these studies revealed that 1,3,7,9,13,15,19,21-octaazapentacyclo[19.3.1.1.1.1]octacosane exists in two conformations, one in which the eight N atoms are diequatorially substituted (D2d symmetry) and one with an equatorialâ€“axial substitution in each 1,3-diazane ring (S4 symmetry). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations (Galasso et al., 2001) showed that the S4 conformer is more stable than the D2d conformer by 2.6 kcal mol 1 (1 kcal mol 1 = 4.184 kJ mol ), due to dipoleâ€“dipole repulsion between the axial lone pairs of the N atoms. A previous X-ray structural investigation of a 1:1 complex of 1,3,7,9,13,15,19,21-octaazapentacyclo[19.3.1.1.1.1]octacosane and benzene showed that the 16-membered pentacyclooctaaza ring exists in a less symmetric but more stable conformation (Murray-Rust, 1975). However, the most favourable conformation is avoided when 1,3,7,9,13,15,19,21octaazapentacyclo[19.3.1.1.1.1]octacosane crystallizes as a 1:2 dichloromethane complex (Dale et al., 1991), where the D2d conformation exhibits a syn-axial orientation of the Natom lone pairs, showing the so-called rabbit-ear effect (Hutchins et al., 1968). Repulsion is avoided due to the presence of intermolecular interactions between the N atoms and the H atoms of the dichloromethane molecules (Dale et al., 1991).",2010,
Machine Learning Enabled Computational Screening of Inorganic Solid Electrolytes for Dendrite Suppression with Li Metal Anode,"Next generation batteries based on lithium (Li) metal anodes have been plagued by the dendritic electrodeposition of Li metal on the anode during cycling, resulting in short circuit and capacity loss. Suppression of dendritic growth through the use of solid electrolytes has emerged as one of the most promising strategies for enabling the use of Li metal anodes. We perform a computational screening of over 12,000 inorganic solids based on their ability to suppress dendrite initiation in contact with Li metal anode. Properties for mechanically isotropic and anisotropic interfaces that can be used in stability criteria for determining the propensity of dendrite initiation are 1 ar X iv :1 80 4. 04 65 1v 1 [ co nd -m at .m tr lsc i] 1 2 A pr 2 01 8 usually obtained from computationally expensive first-principles methods. In order to obtain a large dataset for screening, we use machine learning models to predict the mechanical properties of several new solid electrolytes. The machine learning models are trained on purely structural features of the material, which do not require any first-principles calculations. We train a convolutional neural network on the shear and bulk moduli because of the availability of a large training dataset that has low noise due to low uncertainty in their first-principles calculated values. We use AdaBoost, Lasso and Bayesian ridge regression to train the elastic constants, where the choice of the model depended on the size of the training data and the noise that it can handle. Our models give us direct interpretability by revealing the dominant structural features affecting the elastic constants. The stiffness is found to increase with a decrease in volume per atom, increase in minimum anion-anion separation, and increase in sublattice (all but Li) packing fraction. Cross-validation/test performance suggests our models generalize well. We predict over twenty mechanically anisotropic interfaces between Li metal and six solid electrolytes which can be used to suppress dendrite growth. Our screened candidates are generally soft and highly anisotropic, and present opportunities for simultaneously obtaining dendrite suppression and high ionic conductivity in solid electrolytes.",2018,ArXiv

Dedicating Music: The Case of Philippus de Monteâ€™s Motet Prints,"The act of dedicating music books was a common practice in the sixteenth century. To date, dedicatory letters introducing printed music have been consulted for retrieving mainly biographical or circumstantial information. This article presents a close reading of the paratexts included in Philippus de Monteâ€™s motet prints. In addition to pointing out a hitherto insufficiently explored connection between the imperial chapel-master and the French court environment, it discusses the political possibilities of one of the editions through a comparison with Orlando di Lassoâ€™s 1571 Paris edition of five-voice motets. Furthermore, Monteâ€™s own awareness of the possibilities and functioning of the dedication medium is traced throughout the paratexts. The study also highlights Monteâ€™s unique treatment of secular motets with regard to both compositional practice and publication choices.",2011,
Group sparse reconstruction for image segmentation,"Abstract Image segmentation is a fundamental problem in computer vision and image analysis. Specially, the segmentation of medical images can assist doctors in making decisions. Due to the lack of distinctive features to describe the boundary of an organ and match function with high performance for features, medical image segmentation is difficult to be achieved with high accuracy. In this paper, an one-class classifier is proposed as the match function to decide whether the pixel belongs to the boundary or not. The proposed method is comprised of two steps. At first, a feature vector space is built with the gradient feature and its statistical information in the training stage. In the test image, a feature vector of one candidate probably being located on the boundary is reconstructed by sparse coding with the feature vector space. After reconstruction, the candidate is classified belonging to boundary or non-boundary via the reconstruction based one-class classifier. Then, in order to maintain the consistency between the candidates which are neighbors to each other, the neighboring candidates are coded using group lasso with the same dictionary. Compared to the traditional methods, the proposed one has three advantages. Firstly, it solves the non-Gaussian distribution problem of the positive samples. Secondly, it avoids large variation among the negative samples. Thirdly, the relationship of the neighboring candidates is considered and used in classification, which is ignored in other methods. The proposed method is validated on 52 MR images of prostate and outperforms Mahalanobis distance, which is considered as one of the state-of-the-art match functions.

A predictive model for conversion to psychosis in clinical high-risk patients.,"BACKGROUND
The authors developed a practical and clinically useful model to predict the risk of psychosis that utilizes clinical characteristics empirically demonstrated to be strong predictors of conversion to psychosis in clinical high-risk (CHR) individuals. The model is based upon the Structured Interview for Psychosis Risk Syndromes (SIPS) and accompanying clinical interview, and yields scores indicating one's risk of conversion.


METHODS
Baseline data, including demographic and clinical characteristics measured by the SIPS, were obtained on 199 CHR individuals seeking evaluation in the early detection and intervention for mental disorders program at the New York State Psychiatric Institute at Columbia University Medical Center. Each patient was followed for up to 2 years or until they developed a syndromal DSM-4 disorder. A LASSO logistic fitting procedure was used to construct a model for conversion specifically to a psychotic disorder.


RESULTS
At 2 years, 64 patients (32.2%) converted to a psychotic disorder. The top five variables with relatively large standardized effect sizes included SIPS subscales of visual perceptual abnormalities, dysphoric mood, unusual thought content, disorganized communication, and violent ideation. The concordance index (c-index) was 0.73, indicating a moderately strong ability to discriminate between converters and non-converters.


CONCLUSIONS
The prediction model performed well in classifying converters and non-converters and revealed SIPS measures that are relatively strong predictors of conversion, comparable with the risk calculator published by NAPLS (c-index = 0.71), but requiring only a structured clinical interview. Future work will seek to externally validate the model and enhance its performance with the incorporation of relevant biomarkers.",2019,Psychological medicine

Analysis of acoustic dot echo signature over an Antarctic ice shelf: the possible remote sensing of Antarctic petrels,"Data from a monostatic acoustic radar operating at British Antarctic Survey's Halley station on a coastal Antarctic ice shelf show a band of small target echoes at an altitude of 700-1000 m during spring 1991. Statistical analysis of the echo signature show that the targets are spread more evenly in the horizontal than would be expected for a random signature, whilst the local distribution in the vertical is Gaussian. Similar echo signatures have been observed previously, and are attributed to birds, bats or insects: the Antarctic data are also consistent with bird targets, but the case is not proven. No birds have been observed directly, but at 700 in they would be barely visible to the naked eye. The nearest nesting area with suitably large numbers of birds (Antarctic petrels, Thalassoica antarctica) is a few hundred kilometres away. Estimates of velocity and target density imply that the Halley site would need to be specially favoured by the colony for their acoustic signature to be observed in such numbers, but such might be the case due to the presence of perennial coastal open water to the west of the station.",2002,Antarctic Science

Outcome of early postoperative active mobilisation following tendon transfer procedures for claw hand correction: A Prospective study,"INTRODUCTION: Post operative immobilization of the hand in a cast is the conventional 
practice following the tendon transfer for the claw hand deformity correction. 
The wrist and the Metacarpophalangeal joints (MCP) are immobilized for a 
period of 4 weeks following the Zancolli's lasso procedure for claw deformity 
correction. After cast removal, 4 weeks is required for the tendon transfer reeducation 
before the patient is allowed to use the hand for daily living 
activities. The period of morbidity with the post-operative immobilization of 
the hand extends up to 7-8 weeks. Post immobilization stiffness may increase 
the rehabilitation time and further delay in return to activities. 
The concept of immediate active mobilization of tendon transfer was 
reported recently by Rath. His immediate post operative active mobilisation 
trial shows the benefit of 40% reduction in rehabilitation time . 
To test this concept on tendon transfer for claw deformity correction , 
we did a prospective study of an Analysis of results of Early Postoperative 
Active Mobilization following FDS middle finger 4 tail pulley insertions 
(4TP) for claw hand correction ( Lasso procedure). The outcomes of this 
procedure were compared with conventional immobilization in a cast for claw 
hand deformity correction. 
AIM OF THE STUDY: 
To Test the safety, efficacy and reliability of early postoperative active 
mobilisation after tendon transfer surgery and to compare the outcomes 
with those after conventional post operative immobilisation in the claw 
hand deformity correction. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with the mobile claw hand deformities due to the complete ulnar nerve 
paralysis are taken up for our study. 
Total no of the patients â€“ 12 cases. 
Inclusion Criteria - 
1. Traumatic ulnar nerve palsy or Tardy ulnar nerve palsy not recovered after 
surgical treatment, 
2. In cases of leprosy , after Completion of the drug therapy , 
3. All the MCP and the PIP joints should be supple, 
4. Good function of the FDS of the middle finger. 
Exclusion Criteria - 
1. Contracture angle of the fingers more than 300, 
2. Extensor expansion damage, 
3. Weakness of FDS of middle finger, 
4. Ulcer over the finger tips and neuropathic joints. 
 
RESULTS: The following are the results of the study: 
1.There was no incidence of the transferred tendon rupture during early active 
Mobilisation. 
2. The mean morbidity was 34 days ( range 29 -38 days). 
3.The morbidity was reduced by 20 days (37%) with early active mobilisation 
compared with Rath immobilisation group. 
4. The analysis of results of the deformity correction in the open hand position 
( MCP joint and PIP joint angles) as per the criteria of Palande shows 82% 
of the patients had good deformity correction , 10% had fair results and 8% 
had poor results. 
5. The analysis of results of the tendon transfer integration in intrinsic plus 
position shows good results in 91% of the patients and fair in 6% and poor in 
3% of the patients. 
6. The analysis of the results of fist closure at the follow up of 6 th month 
shows 74% of the patients had good results , 20% of the patients had fair 
results and 6% in poor results. 
7. Comparision of the early active mobilisation results with published reports 
of immobilisation of tendon transfer for claw hand deformity correction shows 
better outcome and also added benefit of reduced morbidity. 
CONCLUSION: The early active mobilisation is safe and has the better outcomes of 
deformity correction compared to immobilisation with a selected donor 
with a strong insertion. 
Increased strength of tendon transfer insertion and protection of the 
insertion during early active mobilisation are the two essential 
requirements for this new tendon transfer rehabilitation protocol. 
Wider application of this principle to other tendon transfer can 
be investigated with incorporating the above two principles. 
Future randomized controlled trials will provide insight into the 
differences in post operative behavior of the tendon transfer with early 
mobilization versus immobilization. 
The neurophysiologic basis of the isolation of donor, integration of 
tendon transfer and movement restoration can now be tracked in the 
immediate postoperative period with functional MRI or PET scans.",2013,
"Situation of Artificial Depigmentation among Women in 2016 to Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso","INTRODUCTION: The artificial depigmentation (DA) is a practice that aims to reduce the natural pigmentation of the skin by the use of depigmenting products (DP). In Burkina Faso, few studies have been made on the issue and the last date of 2003. The objective of the study is to realize an overview of the DA phenomenon in women population in Bobo-Dioulasso City. METHODS: This is a descriptive cross-sectional study held from April 16th to April 30th 2016 including 437 women aged from 13 to 55 years old. A multi-stage random sampling was realized A chi-square test was used to compare groups with significant threshold of 5%. RESULTS: The prevalence of the use of DP (67.28% with IC95 = [63.52 - 71.03]). The mean age of users was 27.5 years old; the typical profile was women from 30 to 35 years old (85.7%), with elementary study level, (73.47%), housewifeâ€™s (75.19%) and monogamous (71.98%). the products used was those made of hydroquinone (81.6%), EDTA (8.33%), kojic acid (4.86%), mixtures (11.12%) or unknown products (14.58%). The origin of the product was doubtful for almost all the cases (98.96%). The monthly mean cost of this practice for a single user is 1710 CFA. Complications were reported in 62.5% of users, and the most found was dyschromia (85.87%), acne (17.39%) and burns (10.32%). DISCUSSION: The DA is in great progress in Bobo-Dioulasso (2 out of 3 women) compared to half, thirteen years ago. The hydroquinone was markedly the most frequent DP while there was an apparent lack of corticosteroids and mercuries replaced by the new depigmenting agent such as EDTA and kojic acid. This result contrasted with the classic combination hydroquinone-dermocorticoid-mercuries reported by previous studies. CONCLUSION: The low-cost of DP could explain the magnitude of the artificial depigmentation phenomenon. Other studies should be conducted in order to establish with precision the composition of these products and their causality in the occurrence of common complications. Research in cosmetology should make it possible to provide women with safe products that respect their deep needs.",2017,"Journal of Cosmetics, Dermatological Sciences and Applications"

When available, predictions with realtime vehicle location and, in particular, passenger count data significantly outperform predictions based only on historical data, with accuracy improvements varying in magnitude across target stations and prediction horizons.",2019,
Notes on the Plymouth Marine fauna,"The following records were obtained during a fortnight at the beginning of April 1949. The localities investigated were rocky shorepools below the Laboratory, and a small area at the upper tidal limit of Tamerton Lake. In addition to imagoes collected on the wing, larvae were reared from a mud sample taken from the stream bed just below the upper limit of tidal penetration. None of the Tamerton speciesare marine in the strict sense adopted by Edwards (1926),but those bred out are tolerant of brackish water and belong to the estuarine fauna. Of the speciesmentioned none occur in the Plymouth Marine Fauna (Mar. BioI. Assoc., 1931), but Thalassomyiafraunfeldi has been recorded from Wembury (Colman, 1940).",1949,
Two New Pre-emergence Grass Killers for the South African Sugar Industry,"Two new products, Butisan S. (metazachlor) and Harness EC (acetochlor), have been developed recently for use in sugarcane in South Africa. The results of the efficacy and phytotoxicity experiments designed to evaluate these proÂ­ ducts are given in this paper. Both products belong to the acetanilide group of chemicals of which two, Lasso EC (alachlor) and Dual (metolachlor), are already registered. These products control annual and some perennial grass speÂ­ cies when applied to the soil before weed germination. They provide control of Cyperus esculentus (yellow nutgrass) unÂ­ der favourable conditions, and limited control of broadleaf weeds. Alachlor and metolachlor have shown no phytotoxic effects on sugarcane. The two new products appear to have a similar control action on weeds but Butisan S is slightly more active on C. esculentus than the other products, and both Butisan S and Harness EC have a wider spectrum of broadleaf control. These products should however be used with an additional chemical to provide effective broadleaf weed control. Both new products, and particularly Butisan S, have shown phytotoxic effects on cane grown in pots, but field experiments suggest that no yield reductions are likely to occur from correct applications.",1986,
Abundancia estacional y distribuciÃ³n vertical del zooplancton gelatinoso carnÃ­voro en una Ã¡rea de surgencia en el norte del Sistema de la Corriente de Humboldt,"Seasonal abundance and vertical distribution of the carnivorous gelatinous zooplankton in an upwelling area of the northern Humboldt Current System ABSTRACT. The seasonal abundance and vertical distribution of gelatinous zooplankton collected during four cruises off Mejillones bay were analyzed. In this area we identified 44 species of macroplankton distributed in 23 siphonophores, 17 hydromedusae, and 4 ctenophores. Eight species, Sphaeronectes irregularis, Rhizophysa eysenhardti, Amphogona apicata, Proboscidactyla stellata, Sarsia coccometra, Pleurobrachia bachei, Thalassocalyce inconstans and Velamen parallelum, are the first records in the Humboldt Current System. The seasonal distribution showed an increase in abundance in spring and summer, with the highest aggregations (> 2600 indÂ·100 m -3 ) of Aglaura hemistoma, Solmundella bitentaculata, Muggiaea atlantica and Pleurobrachia bachei in October and Obelia spp. in February. The highest densities were observed in the coastal station and in the oceanic front, while the oceanic station was characterized by a strong decrease in abundance. The vertical distribution showed that the most dominant species were founded in the first 100 m of the water column, with a higher concentration of organisms in the first 25 or 50 m of depth. This vertical distribution could be limited by presence of a minimum dissolved oxygen layer (< 1 mlÂ·L -1 ) in shallow waters (30-50",2004,Investigaciones Marinas
Clinical Effect Analysis of Atrial Fibrillation after Catheter Ablation,"Objectives Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the most common cardiac arrhythmias, which is harmful to human health and quality of life. AADs are limited in clinical because of their side effects, so in recent years, RFCA has become one of the effective treatments for AF, whose clinical application is showing a clear upward trend. In order to explore the efficacy and safety of catheter ablation for AF, we have followed up the patients with AF undergoing catheter ablation in this study. Methods A cohort of 39 patients with AF after RFCA from 2008 to 2011 was studied, 25 male and 14 female; the average age was 61.08Â±10.17 (36â€“74) years old. Among them, there were 32 cases with paroxysmal AF, and seven cases with persistent AF. 19 cases were complicated with hypertension, six cases with coronary heart disease, seven cases with diabetes and two cases with cerebral infarction. All the patients suffered from obvious clinical discomfortable symptoms. Although treated by one to two kinds of AADs already, the effects were poor. CPVI was performed in the all of them (five cases recurred, 13.51%). The endpoint of the ablation was complete electronic isolation of all the pulmonary veins (PVs). The patients who were converted to sinus rhythm in the cause of ablation were validated by Lasso electrodes, and could not be evoked atrial arrhythmia again. However, those who were failed to be converted to sinus rhythm would be validated after electroversion. For those who weren9t isolated PVs completely, the conducted gap was initially posited by the mapping catheter, and the earliest fragmented potential was targeted for ablation till the complete electronic isolation of all the PVs. Results (1) The results of catheter ablation: 37 cases were successfully achieved immediately the endpoint after the ablation. Surgery average time of operation was (174.89Â±35.05) min, average X-ray exposure time (33.62Â±16.44) min, average discharge time (40.78Â±11.61) min; No severe complications such as pulmonary vein stenosis, pericardial tamponade, cardio-esophagus fistula, stroke occurred during and after the procedure. One case with paroxysmal AF was converted to auricular flutter after ablation, who were failed to be converted to sinus rhythm by synchronised cardioversion, but converted after Marshall Ligament ablation; three cases with persistent AF undergoing ablation were turned to be sinus rhythm by cardioversion; one case with persistent AF undergoing ablation was converted to sinus rhythm by intravenous irapbullitt. Five cases developed atrial tachyarrhythmias in 5â€“7â€…days after ablation: four cases appeared paroxysmal AF with fast ventricular rate; one case appeared paroxysmal atrial tachycardia; another one was sinus bradycardia, junctional escape. All the patients didn9t suffer dysponea, cough, haemoptysis and so on before discharge, moreover distention of jugular vein, pulsus paradoxus and pericardial rub were not found through physical examination. No severe complication happened during and after the procedure, and all of them maintained sinus rhythm before discharge. (2) Follow-up: 37 cases were followed-up after 6â€“12â€…months, average 6Â±2â€…months, only one case lost communication and one case died of congestive heart failure. Five cases recurred: one case with paroxysmal AF who recurred after simple CPVI refused re-ablation, decreased episode frequency and took amiodarone to maintain sinus rhythm. One patient who performed CPVI and atria sinistrum isthmus ablation, three cases with paroxysmal AF appeared atrial arrhythmia after RFCA, but they refused re-ablation temporarily because of decreasing episode frequency. 36 cases took warfarin according to monitoring INR periodically, while one case took warfarin only 2â€…months after ablation because of hemorrhinia. Dysponea, cough related to pulmonary vein stenosis, and thromboembolism complications didn9t occur for all of the cases. The LAD of 29 cases recovered normal size (LADâ‰¤35â€…mm) on cardiac ultrasound 3â€…months after ablation. The lower the preoperative LVEF is, the more obvious the improvement is after RFCA. Conclusions Catheter ablation is safe and effective for treating AF.",2012,Heart
Shrinkage and Penalty Estimation Strategies in Some Spatial Models,"In this dissertation, we study the asymptotic properties of pretest and shrinkage estimators of the large-scale effect in some spatial regression models, and compare their relative performance with respect to the classical maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) analytically and numerically through Monte Carlo experiments and real data examples. The shrinkage estimators were also numerically compared with three penalty estimators, namely, the LASSO, adaptive LASSO, and the SCAD penalty functions. A linear model with conditional autoregressive errors was studied in Chapter 2. The asymptotic properties of the shrinkage estimators, under local alternatives, were established, including the derivations of the asymptotic distributional bias, asymptotic mean squared error matrix, and the asymptotic quadratic risk. These results showed the effectiveness of the suggested estimation technique. Monte Carlo experiments with two real data examples were conducted to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed shrinkage estimators over the MLE and the penalty estimators. In Chapter 3, we consider another spatial case of a linear model with simultaneous autoregressive errors. We study the properties of the shrinkage estimators and compare their performance with the penalty estimators numerically through simulation studies and real data examples. Chapter 4 contains a study of a general linear model with spatial moving average error terms. Asymptotic properties of the shrinkage estimators for the mean parameter vector are investigated. A numerical comparison is carried out and the relative performance of estimators is investigated. Finally, we summarize the findings of the thesis in Chapter 5. Also, some problems for future research are outlined in Chapter 5.",2013,

High dimensional confounding adjustment using continuous spike and slab priors,"In observational studies, estimation of a causal effect of a treatment on an outcome relies on proper adjustment for confounding. If the number of the potential confounders ($p$) is larger than the number of observations ($n$), then direct control for all potential confounders is infeasible. Existing approaches for dimension reduction and penalization are generally aimed at predicting the outcome, and are less suited for estimation of causal effects. Under standard penalization approaches (e.g. Lasso), if a variable $X_j$ is strongly associated with the treatment $T$ but weakly with the outcome $Y$, the coefficient $\beta_j$ will be shrunk towards zero thus leading to confounding bias. 
Under the assumption of a linear model for the outcome and sparsity, we propose continuous spike and slab priors on the regression coefficients $\beta_j$ corresponding to the potential confounders $X_j$. Specifically, we introduce a prior distribution that does not heavily shrink to zero the coefficients ($\beta_j$s) of the $X_j$s that are strongly associated with $T$ but weakly associated with $Y$. We compare our proposed approach to several state of the art methods proposed in the literature. Our proposed approach has the following features: 1) it reduces confounding bias in high dimensional settings; 2) it shrinks towards zero coefficients of instrumental variables; and 3) it achieves good coverages even in small sample sizes. We apply our approach to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data to estimate the causal effects of persistent pesticide exposure on triglyceride levels.",2017,arXiv: Methodology

Sparse Relaxed Regularized Regression: SR3,"Regularized regression problems are ubiquitous in statistical modeling, signal processing, and machine learning. Sparse regression in particular has been instrumental in scientific model discovery, including compressed sensing applications, variable selection, and high-dimensional analysis. We propose a new and highly effective approach for regularized regression, called SR3. 
The key idea is to solve a relaxation of the regularized problem, which has three advantages over the state-of-the-art: (1) solutions of the relaxed problem are superior with respect to errors, false positives, and conditioning, (2) relaxation allows extremely fast algorithms for both convex and nonconvex formulations, and (3) the methods apply to composite regularizers such as total variation (TV) and its nonconvex variants. We demonstrate the improved performance of SR3 across a range of regularized regression problems with synthetic and real data, including compressed sensing, LASSO, matrix completion and TV regularization. To promote reproducible research, we include a companion Matlab package that implements these popular applications.",2018,ArXiv

Bayesian estimation of sparse signals with a continuous spike-and-slab prior,"We introduce a new framework for estimation of sparse normal means, bridging the gap between popular frequentist strategies (LASSO) and popular Bayesian strategies (spike-and-slab). The main thrust of this paper is to introduce the family of Spike-andSlab LASSO (SS-LASSO) priors, which form a continuum between the Laplace prior and the point-mass spike-and-slab prior. We establish several appealing frequentist properties of SS-LASSO priors, contrasting them with these two limiting cases. First, we adopt the penalized likelihood perspective on Bayesian modal estimation and introduce the framework of Bayesian penalty mixing with spike-andslab priors. We show that the SS-LASSO global posterior mode is (near) minimax rate-optimal under squared error loss, similarly as the LASSO. Going further, we introduce an adaptive two-step estimator which can achieve provably sharper performance than the LASSO. Second, we show that the whole posterior keeps pace with the global mode and concentrates at the (near) minimax rate, a property that is known not to hold for the single Laplace prior. The minimax-rate optimality is obtained with a suitable class of independent product priors (for known levels of sparsity) as well as with dependent mixing priors (adapting to the unknown levels of sparsity). Up to now, the rate-optimal posterior concentration has been established only for spike-and-slab priors with a point mass at zero. Thus, the SS-LASSO priors, despite being continuous, possess similar optimality properties as the â€œtheoretically idealâ€ point-mass mixtures. These results provide valuable theoretical justification for our proposed class of priors, underpinning their intuitive appeal and practical potential.",2018,Annals of Statistics
Identifying main effects and epistatic interactions from large-scale SNP data via adaptive group Lasso,"BackgroundSingle nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) based association studies aim at identifying SNPs associated with phenotypes, for example, complex diseases. The associated SNPs may influence the disease risk individually (main effects) or behave jointly (epistatic interactions). For the analysis of high throughput data, the main difficulty is that the number of SNPs far exceeds the number of samples. This difficulty is amplified when identifying interactions.ResultsIn this paper, we propose an Adaptive Group Lasso (AGL) model for large-scale association studies. Our model enables us to analyze SNPs and their interactions simultaneously. We achieve this by introducing a sparsity constraint in our model based on the fact that only a small fraction of SNPs is disease-associated. In order to reduce the number of false positive findings, we develop an adaptive reweighting scheme to enhance sparsity. In addition, our method treats SNPs and their interactions as factors, and identifies them in a grouped manner. Thus, it is flexible to analyze various disease models, especially for interaction detection. However, due to the intensive computation when millions of interaction terms needs to be searched in the model fitting, our method needs to combined with some filtering methods when applied to genome-wide data for detecting interactions.ConclusionBy using a wide range of simulated datasets and a real dataset from WTCCC, we demonstrate the advantages of our method.",2010,BMC Bioinformatics
A Closer Look at Party Hosting Behaviors within Off-Campus College Settings,"ABSTRACT Colleges and universities have taken a variety of approaches to combat alcohol and other drug misuse among students. This descriptive quantitative study aims to investigate the behaviors of students who host off-campus parties and how these behaviors shape party environments. Undergraduate students (N=2,146) completed an online survey to capture the perceptions of off-campus party participants about party events and student behaviors. Results indicate that White students, male students and students 21 and older were more likely to host off-campus parties than students of color, female students and students under 21. Party hosts (N=501) took few precautionary measures to ensure a safer party environment and were unlikely to intervene to protect guests, including intervening with intoxicated guests or taking responsibility to prevent drunk driving. Keywords: alcohol and other drugs, off-campus parties, party hosts, peer intervention, prevention ********** Off-campus student-sponsored parties are a common part of undergraduate student life and are known to be settings in which students drink heavily (Harford, Wechsler, & Seibring, 2002; Jakeman, Silver, & Molasso, 2014). Off-campus parties (OCP) also lead to other risky and dangerous behaviors, resulting in alcohol poisoning, drug overdoses, sexual assault and student deaths (Harford, Wechsler, & Muthen, 2003; Park, 2004; Sandeen & Barr, 2006). Further, the heavy drinking associated with OCP environments has negative consequences for students' wellbeing and academic outcomes (Carrell, Hoekstra, & West, 2011; Sharma, 2013; Dahlen, Czar, Prather, & Dyess, 2013; Grossbard et al., 2014; Smith, Finneran, & Droppa, 2014). To address these issues, campus administrators make use of a variety of tools including training programs, peer educators and community coalitions. These programs often rely on an understanding both of individual and group behavior and the environments in which students engage in high-risk activities (Thomas & Seibold, 1995; Bum, 2009; Vander Ven, 2011). While assessments of these programs have demonstrated success in improving students' willingness to intervene in dangerous or problem situations (Banyard, Moynihan, & Crossman, 2009; Lynch & Fleming, 2005), to date such efforts may be constrained by a lack of research on the party environment and students who host parties. In particular, we lack an understanding of the role of party hosts in shaping and monitoring party environments. Bystander intervention is one of the best-known strategies for addressing safety at student-led parties and in environments where alcohol is consumed. These efforts build upon education efforts designed to address issues of sexual assault (Grasgreen, 2011). Bystander intervention programs, or peer-to-peer interventions in problematic situations, have been described as a beneficial way to address student alcohol misuse. The success and expansion of student-led programs like the ""Red Watch Band"" at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, ""Quaker Bouncers"" at Haverford College, and ""SOTEER"" at Dartmouth College provide support for the comprehensive expansion of alcohol-focused bystander intervention programs (Grasgreen, 2011; Johnson, 2009). Campus administrators seeking to establish appropriate intervention programs are challenged to adapt institution-specific model programs and policies to their campus environments. This challenge to tailor programs and policies, as well as a general lack of empirical research on party environments can result in a ""trial-and-error"" approach to program development. Institutional efforts are further criticized for their focus on training students on how to intervene (e.g., recognize signs, diffuse situation, call 911) rather than on when to intervene (e.g., campus settings; McMahon, Banyard, & McMahon, 2015). In examining various settings in which alcohol consumption occurs, Harford, Wechsler, and Seibring (2002) found that ""the overall prevalence of heavy drinking was highest among off-campus parties (31% of the total sample of current drinkers)"" (p. â€¦",2015,Journal of Alcohol and Drug Education

The lasso method for variable selection in the Cox model.,"I propose a new method for variable selection and shrinkage in Cox's proportional hazards model. My proposal minimizes the log partial likelihood subject to the sum of the absolute values of the parameters being bounded by a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint, it shrinks coefficients and produces some coefficients that are exactly zero. As a result it reduces the estimation variance while providing an interpretable final model. The method is a variation of the 'lasso' proposal of Tibshirani, designed for the linear regression context. Simulations indicate that the lasso can be more accurate than stepwise selection in this setting.",1997,Statistics in medicine

Endmember finding and spectral unmixing using least-angle regression,"A new endmember finder and spectral unmixing algorithm based on the LARS/Lasso method for linear regression is developed. The endmember finder is sequential; a single endmember is identified at first and further endmembers which depend on the previous ones are found. The process terminates once a pre-determined number of endmembers have been found, or when the modeling error has attained the noise floor. The unmixing algorithm is a straightforward procedure that expresses each pixel as a linear combination of endmembers in a physically meaningful way. This algorithm successfully unmixes simulated data, and shows promising results on real hyperspectral images as well.",2010,

Writing a Novel: The Process and its Implications in Teaching,"For elementary teachers especially, the writing process is an important element in the classroom. It has multiple parts and is taught throughout the year at every grade level. Thus far, I had very little writing instruction from a teacher's perspective. We took science and geography classes to learn much more than we would ever teach in the classroom. We learned the ins and outs of linguistics and language acquisition, so that we could better understand the process of reading and writing. Due to this knowledge, I am better prepared as a teacher because I can approach education from a vantage point in the subject, rather than learning the material as I teach it. I want to teach writing from that same high vantage point. The purpose of this research is to see writing from the perspective of a writer, not just a student or educator. What factors do writer's take into account? How do real writers write, outside of school standards? How does the writing process look when it's used in an authentic way, not the processed steps it is often taught in? This is what I explored, so that I could teach writing from a more authentic perspective. Objective In order to teach writing in an authentic way, I needed to understand what it is like to ""be a writer"" and the process used. Students in elementary mostly write fiction and personal narrative. With this in mind, I focused primarily on fictional writing instead of research based or informational writing. I completed a basic, first rough draft of a short novella. It contains only the bare framework of the main story plot, with much left to be added. This allowed me to see the beginning of the drafting process and the trajectory the drafts would continue on. It also allowed me to see the editing and revising that becomes necessary and presents itself after an initial draft is completed. Step 1: Pre-writing: The Research behind the project Before any piece can be written, brainstorming and research must take place. A deeper understanding will make the final product much more successful. I enrolled in two separate courses and read books on the topic of narrative writing, and gained some interesting perspectives on writing and the pre-writing stage in particular. ïƒ± 1.) One aspect to fictional writing that stood out focused on showing versus telling the reader in the story. In writing, the author can paint a picture and let the reader see what is happening, or the writer can tell the reader what happened. Typically, readers would much rather see what is happening and make their own judgment calls than have the author tell them. Example 1: It was coming toward him, but there was nothing he could do. In one quick blur, Tom's fist landed with a sickening crunch. Blood flowed freely from Larry's nose. Example 2: Tom punched Larry in the face and broke his nose. In the example above, description is used to show the action, rather than saying what occurred. Showing versus telling can also be used in description, not just action scenes. For example, rather than saying she was beautiful, describe her hair that falls like a soft veil around her shoulders and eyes that glimmer like emeralds. This may feel like common sense to those who are well read, but writers, especially children, don't learn to focus on the effective parts they see in reading until they are taught. ïƒ± 2.) Another important step in the pre-writing phase is to know the main characters better than the audience. Authors should delve deep into the formation of the character until they know their favorite color, what they carry in their purse or wallet, what their family is like, what they dream of, etc. The more questions an author asks about his character as it is formed, the better they can understand them as a person and write about them in a real way. This definitely helps with the characterization and believability of the character during the drafting stage. ïƒ± 3.) An understanding of the basic story structure for all fiction works helps tremendously before an author starts writing. It gives a framework from which to start and how to finish. From there, it can always be tweaked and adapted during revision, but during drafting it provides a helpful structure upon which to write. â—¦ One common way to organize a story structure is by ""acts"", like in plays. â–ª Act 1: This is the beginning of the story, introducing the character. Then, a turning point should be introduced: what's the problem and why should be care? Things start to get worse for the character, but then they come up with a possible solution. â–ª Act 2: The character attempts to solve the problem, and things are looking better for a little while. Then something goes very wrong at it seems all hope is lost. There seems to be no way for the character to succeed in solving their problem. â–ª Act 3: Some decision by the character moves the story forward. Here, the final moment happens: the character either wins or loses, but either way the problem is resolved. (Sometimes the character may abandon original goal, but this must be replaced with a new one.) This is the climax. Afterword, any loose ends are tied up and the character reflects on themselves and/or their journey. ïƒ± 4.) Although this is often overlooked in schools, especially for fiction writing, research is an important part of the pre-writing stage. Reading other books is a great way to research writing styles and story structures before you start writing. Reading will also affect the author's writing style. A great way to try out different writing styles is to read some works by a particular author and then draft some writing. It will take on some of the affects that were noticed during reading. This is something to consider as both a great resource and something to be cautious of; while the styles of other writers can be great inspiration during a first rough draft, many writers prefer to keep their writing their own and their current outside influences to a minimum. Keeping this in mind, some writers consciously avoid reading other material before they write, or change their first rough draft to have a consistent style (closest to their own) throughout during the revision process. Implications for Teachers ïƒ± 1.) Aside from grammatical structures and beginning-middle-end, students are often not taught how to write. Show don't Tell is an excellent strategy that could be practiced in the classroom, just like they practice adding details, to help students make their writing more interesting. By its nature it will help students to add more detail and evidence to their story. It will also add length and possibly complexity to their sentence structure. ïƒ± 2.) Students often spend very little time brainstorming before they write. In schools, the pre-writing stage often consists of making a list of stories the student could write about, and then picking one. Many students see the pre-writing stage as unnecessary, because taught in this way it is. Students are more likely to set themselves up for success if they spend the time brainstorming and planning before they write, but this must be taught. One way to have students brainstorm before writing a fictional piece is to have them answer a series of questions about their character. This is only one example, but in general students should be encouraged to plan and brainstorm before they start writing. ïƒ± 3.) Structure can be very helpful for authors, and it can definitely be helpful for students. While a beginning-middle-end structure may be appropriate for beginning writers, the story structure doesn't get much more complex as students get older. A problem and ""climax"" (where the problem gets solved) are added, but beyond that there is often not a further look into the structure of stories. If we gradually laid out more complex story structure for students, creating graphic organizers to help them at first, students would be capable of much more than we currently expect by middle school. One problem, of course, is that there is no time to teach material beyond what is laid out in the standards, but teaching the writing process correctly (this being a part of both the brainstorming and research aspects of pre-writing) is a part of teaching students how to write. ïƒ± 4.) Most teachers are great at providing examples for students. The research part of pre-writing can be seen in studying examples of story structure, or in an author study, where students write in the style of a particular author (ex: The Very Hungry Caterpillar by Eric Carle, Diary of a Worm by Doreen Cronin.) Of the four, this is the most prominent prewriting aspect that I experienced as a writer that I could easily see occurring in the classroom. The next step is to see that examples and research are used on a more frequent basis. Authors shouldn't only be used for inspiration during an author study. Examples of story structure shouldn't only be classor teacher-made. Use examples from real stories so students can learn to pinpoint the parts. Authors have provided a plethora of resources at the classroom's fingertips, and those resources could be used even more than they already are. Step 2: The Process of Drafting During my study of the writing process, I found a whole new viewpoint for the drafting stage. As a whole, the first draft should be viewed as an imperfect, incomplete version of writing, complete with only the bare bones of structure. This is very different from how most students view drafting. There are many tools that writers use when working on a draft. ïƒ± 1.) The first important thing to realize is that real writers make huge mistakes, like tense problems or point of view, and edit and revise many times. The first draft is meant to get the author from start to finish, and explore the different formats and possibilities the story could have. It should be far from perfect; that's what editing and revising is for. An author should feel free to explore and try crazy things when writing a first draft; ",2013,

LASSO GUARANTEES FOR Î²-MIXING HEAVY TAILED TIME SERIES âˆ— By,"Many theoretical results for lasso require the samples to be iid. Recent work has provided guarantees for lasso assuming that the time series is generated by a sparse Vector Auto-Regressive (VAR) model with Gaussian innovations. Proofs of these results rely critically on the fact that the true data generating mechanism (DGM) is a finite-order Gaussian VAR. This assumption is quite brittle: linear transformations, including selecting a subset of variables, can lead to the violation of this assumption. In order to break free from such assumptions, we derive non-asymptotic inequalities for estimation error and prediction error of lasso estimate of the best linear predictor without assuming any special parametric form of the DGM. Instead, we rely only on (strict) stationarity and geometrically decaying Î²mixing coefficients to establish error bounds for lasso for subweibull random vectors. The class of subweibull random variables that we introduce includes subgaussian and subexponential random variables but also includes random variables with tails heavier than an exponential. We also show that, for Gaussian processes, the Î²-mixing condition can be relaxed to summability of the Î±-mixing coefficients. Our work provides an alternative proof of the consistency of lasso for sparse Gaussian VAR models. But the applicability of our results extends to non-Gaussian and non-linear times series models as the examples we provide demonstrate.",2019,
"Regression Shrinkage and Selection via the Elastic Net , with Applications to Microarrays","We propose the elastic net, a new regression shrinkage and selection method. Real data and a simulation study show that the elastic net often outperforms the lasso, while it enjoys a similar sparsity of representation. In addition, the elastic net encourages a grouping effect, where strong correlated predictors are kept in the model. The elastic net is particularly useful in the analysis of microarray data in which the number of genes (predictors) is much bigger than the number of samples (observations). We show how the elastic net can be used to construct a classification rule and do automatic gene selection at the same time in microarray data, where the lasso is not very satisfied. We also propose an efficient algorithm for solving the elastic net based on the recently invented LARS algorithm. keywords: Gene selection; Grouping effect; Lasso; LARS algorithm; Microarray classification.",2003,

Shrinkage Estimation of the Varying Coefficient Model,"The varying coefficient model is a useful extension of the linear regression model. Nevertheless, how to conduct variable selection for the varying coefficient model in a computationally efficient manner is poorly understood. To solve the problem, we propose here a novel method, which combines the ideas of the local polynomial smoothing and the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO). The new method can do nonparametric estimation and variable selection simultaneously. With a local constant estimator and the adaptive LASSO penalty, the new method can identify the true model consistently, and that the resulting estimator can be as efficient as the oracle estimator. Numerical studies clearly confirm our theories. Extension to other shrinkage methods (e.g., the SCAD, i.e., the Smoothly Clipped Absolute Deviation.) and other smoothing methods is straightforward.",2009,Journal of the American Statistical Association
A multi-stage intelligent approach based on an ensemble of two-way interaction model for forecasting the global horizontal radiation of India,"Abstract Forecasting of effective solar irradiation has developed a huge interest in recent decades, mainly due to its various applications in grid connect photovoltaic installations. This paper develops and investigates an ensemble learning based multistage intelligent approach to forecast 5Â days global horizontal radiation at four given locations of India. The two-way interaction model is considered with purpose of detecting the associated correlation between the features. The main structure of the novel method is the ensemble learning, which is based on Divide and Conquer principle, is applied to enhance the forecasting accuracy and model stability. An efficient feature selection method LASSO is performed in the input space with the regularization parameter selected by Cross-Validation. A weight vector which best represents the importance of each individual model in ensemble system is provided by glowworm swarm optimization. The combination of feature selection and parameter selection are helpful in creating the diversity of the ensemble learning. In order to illustrate the validity of the proposed method, the datasets at four different locations of the India are split into training and test datasets. The results of the real data experiments demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of the proposed method comparing with other competitors.",2017,Energy Conversion and Management

In this paper, we compare various techniques such as bagging, boosting, LASSO, random forest and support vector machine with the daily lens transaction data. The classical techniques-decision tree, logistic regression-are used too. The experiment shows that the random forest has a little smaller misclassification rate and standard error than those of other methods. The performance of the SVM is good in the sense of misclassfication rate and bad in the sense of standard error. Taking the model interpretation and computing time into consideration, we conclude that the LASSO gives the best result.ã€‘",2013,
Estimating Latent Group Structure in Time-Varying Coefficient Panel Data Models,"This paper studies the estimation of latent group structures in heterogeneous time-varying coefficient panel data models. While allowing the coefficient functions to vary over cross sections provides a good way to model cross-sectional heterogeneity, it reduces the degree of freedom and leads to poor estimation accuracy when the time-series length is short. On the other hand, in a lot of empirical studies, it is not uncommon to find that heterogeneous coefficients exhibit group structures where coefficients belonging to the same group are similar or identical. This paper aims to provide an easy and straightforward approach for estimating the underlying latent groups. This approach is based on the hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) of kernel estimates of the heterogeneous time-varying coefficients when the number of groups is known. We establish the consistency of this clustering method and also propose a generalised information criterion for estimating the number of groups when it is unknown. Simulation studies are carried out to examine the finite sample properties of the proposed clustering method as well as the post-clustering estimation of the group- specific time-varying coefficients. The simulation results show that our methods give comparable performance as the penalised-sieve-estimation based classifier Lasso approach by Su et al. (2018), but are computationally easier. An application to a cross-country growth study is also provided.",2019,Econometrics Journal

Adaptive Rotor Blade for Vibration Reduction,"Applying adaptronics to helicopters has a high potential to significantly suppress noise, reduce vibration and increase the overall aerodynamic efficiency. This paper presents recent investigations on a very promising specific concept described as Adaptive Blade Twist (ABT). This concept allows to directly control the twist of the helicopter blades by smart adaptive elements and through this to positively influence the main rotor area which is the primary source for helicopter noise and vibration. Since the interaction of non-stationary heli-copter aerodynamics and elastomechanical structural characteristics of the helicopter blades causes flight envelope limitations, vibration and noise, a good comprehension of the aerodynamics is essential for the development of structural solutions to effectively influence the local airflow conditions and finally develop the structural concept. With respect to these considerations, the ABT concept will be presented. This concept bases on the actively controlled tension-torsion-coupling of the structure. For this, an actuator is integrated within a helicopter blade that is made of anisotropic material based on fiber composites. Driv-ing the actuator results in a local twist of the blade tip, in such a way that the blade can be considered as a torsional actuator. Influencing the blade twist distribution finally results in a higher aerodynamic efficiency. The paper starts at giving a review on conventional concepts and potential adaptive solutions for shape control. Hereafter, some calculations of the adaptive twist control concept are presented. These are based on a representive model in which the active part of the rotor blade is simplified with a thin-walled rectangular beam, that is structurally equivalent to a model rotor blade of the Bo105 with a scaling factor 2,54. The cal-culations are performed using an expanded Wlassow Theory. The results are valid for static and dynamic conditions. For the dynamic condition excessive deformations near the blade resonance frequency shall be utilised. Therefore, the actuated blade section has to be properly designed for this preconditions. This has been demonstrated and verified in experiments which will not be discussed in this paper. For experimental investigations on the ABT concept the skin of the outer part of the model rotor blade was manufactured of fibre composite material using the above mentioned tension-torsion-coupling effect with an additional uncoupling layer between skin and spar. The experimental results have shown that near to the resonance frequency dynamic forces generate a torsional deformation of Â± 1,9 degrees at the blade tip.",2000,
Hyperparameter-free sparse regression of grouped variables,"In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for semi-parametric estimation of an unknown number of signals, each parametrized by a group of components. Via a reformulation of the covariance fitting criteria, we formulate a convex optimization problem over a grid of candidate representations, promoting solutions with only a few active groups. Utilizing the covariance fitting allows for a hyperparameter-free estimation procedure, highly robust against coherency between candidates, while still allowing for a computationally efficient implementation. Numerical simulations illustrate how the proposed method offers a performance similar to the group-LASSO for incoherent dictionaries, and superior performance for coherent dictionaries.",2016,"2016 50th Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers"
"Genome-wide loss of heterozygosity, copy number variations and oral squamous cell carcinoma","186 Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide and is associated with high rate of recurrence and poor survival. To examine whether loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and DNA copy number variations (CNV) are correlated with clinical characteristics of OSCC, we investigated these genetic aberrations on the genome wide level in a study of 39 OSCC patients. DNA isolated from tumor cells obtained by laser capture microdissection and DNA isolated from paired peripheral lymphocytes were interrogated using Affymetrix 250K NspI arrays. LOH was inferred with Hidden Markov Model (HMM). CNV were inferred using CGH Fused Lasso methods (false discovery rate (FDR) = 0.01). Fisherâ€™s exact test was used to test the associations between genetic aberrations and lymph node metastasis and AJCC stage. We observed large inter-individual variation in CNV and LOH profiles among the OSCC patients. The percentage of each genome showing CNV ranged from 16% - 90% (mean Â± sd: 55% Â± 17%). High level of amplification (> 4n) at the cytoband level was observed in up to 23% of the study population; such amplification was most commonly detected at 11q13.2-4 (in more than 15% patients). The percentage of each genome having LOH ranged from 0% - 37% (mean Â± sd: 9% Â± 10%). Greater than 40% of the patients had LOH at chromosome arms 3p, 9p, 11q and 13q. The use of the high resolution array allowed us to identify concurrent LOH and CNV changes that had not been reported previously. Among the 9% autosomal SNP probes showing LOH, 2.1% showed copy number loss, 3.2% showed copy number gain, and the remaining 3.3% were copy neutral LOH. We identified a region of 771 kb in 11q13 that showed both high level copy number amplification and LOH in 26% of the patients; a region of 217 kb in 17q23-q24 that showed copy neutral LOH in 12% patients; and a region of 77 Mb in 3p and 88 kb in 9p21.1 that showed copy number loss LOH in 28% patients. Another novel finding is the association between lymph node metastasis at diagnosis and CNV in a region in 9q34.3 corresponding to the genes KCNT1, CAMSAP1 and UBAC1 (p C15orf15 (p C15orf15 LOH had lymph node metastasis, compared to 25 out of 34 patients without C15orf15 LOH. We did not observe an association between AJCC stage and CNV or LOH. These findings need to be further evaluated in larger studies.",2008,Cancer Research

Acceptability of interventions to reduce mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1 in west Africa.,"Would HIV-1-positive pregnant African women use interventions of AIDS testing, medication (oral or vaginal), and vaginal disinfection to reduce the likelihood of HIV-1 transmission to their child? In this pilot study in two west African cities (Abidjan, CÃ´te d'Ivoire and Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso), social workers gave a native-language questionnaire to 607 pregnant women at four Maternal and Child Health Centers. The women were asked about their perception of the HIV test; consequences of testing and counseling; choice of medical intervention to protect the future child; and feelings about being in a randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trial. Most accepted the principle of an AIDS test, said they wanted the agreement of their regular partner before being tested, and would use interventions to reduce the risk of vertical transmission. The researchers concluded that although concepts of informed consent, randomization, and placebo are difficult to understand, the study results are promising and encourage the evaluation of clinical trials to reduce mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1 in Africa.",1996,Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes and human retrovirology : official publication of the International Retrovirology Association

Note on the modified relaxation CQ algorithm for the split feasibility problem,"In this paper we are concerned with the Split Feasibility Problem (SFP) in which there are given two Hilbert spaces $$H_1$$H1 and $$H_2$$H2, nonempty, closed and convex sets $$C\subseteq H_1$$CâŠ†H1 and $$Q\subseteq H_2$$QâŠ†H2, and a bounded and linear operator $$A:H_1 \rightarrow H_2$$A:H1â†’H2. The SFP is then to find a point $$x^*\in C$$xâˆ—âˆˆC such that its image under A belongs to Q, meaning that $$Ax^*\in Q$$Axâˆ—âˆˆQ. This reformulation was employed successfully for solving many inverse problems: for example, in intensity-modulated radiation therapy treatment planning. One of the typical classes of methods that have been used to solve the SFP is the class of projection method. This note focuses on the modified relaxation CQ algorithm with the Armijo-line search rule for solving the SFP. Under common and standard assumptions, we show that the proposed method weakly converges to a solution of the SFP. Numerical examples illustrating our methodâ€™s efficiency are presented for solving the LASSO problem in which the goal is to recover a sparse signal from a limited number of observations.",2018,Optimization Letters
Extended Bayesian LASSO for multiple quantitative trait loci mapping and unobserved phenotype prediction.,"The Bayesian LASSO (BL) has been pointed out to be an effective approach to sparse model representation and successfully applied to quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping and genomic breeding value (GBV) estimation using genome-wide dense sets of markers. However, the BL relies on a single parameter known as the regularization parameter to simultaneously control the overall model sparsity and the shrinkage of individual covariate effects. This may be idealistic when dealing with a large number of predictors whose effect sizes may differ by orders of magnitude. Here we propose the extended Bayesian LASSO (EBL) for QTL mapping and unobserved phenotype prediction, which introduces an additional level to the hierarchical specification of the BL to explicitly separate out these two model features. Compared to the adaptiveness of the BL, the EBL is ""doubly adaptive"" and thus, more robust to tuning. In simulations, the EBL outperformed the BL in regard to the accuracy of both effect size estimates and phenotypic value predictions, with comparable computational time. Moreover, the EBL proved to be less sensitive to tuning than the related Bayesian adaptive LASSO (BAL), which introduces locus-specific regularization parameters as well, but involves no mechanism for distinguishing between model sparsity and parameter shrinkage. Consequently, the EBL seems to point to a new direction for QTL mapping, phenotype prediction, and GBV estimation.",2010,Genetics
Prehistoric mega-tsunami in the eastern Mediterranean and its sedimentary response,"The volcanic island of Santorini that belongs to the trench-arc-backarc Aegean system of the eastern Mediterranean underwent a catastrophic eruption in the Bronze age (circa 3500 y BP), with caldera collapse and creation of a tsunami wave that was funnelled westward. The sedimentary response to this exceptional event in the deep sea was the deposition of resediments called Homogenites. The data set available after almost thirty years of active research consists of 60 sediment cores, including several giant piston cores up to 30 meters long, raised from water depths ranging from 4100 to 2500 m in discrete parts of the Ionian Sea. Two types of Homogenite are recognized. Type A Homogenite consists of pelagic turbidites typically recorded in the Calabrian Ridge and in the western Mediterranean Ridge accretionary prisms, characterized by the Â«cobblestone topographyÂ», only in lows or basinal settings. Their stratigraphic position consistently above the Holocene sapropel S-1 and the depositional base are interpreted as the result of liquefaction of the unconsolidated pelagic sediments draping the nearby slopes caused by the tsunami waves, followed by downslope movement and settling. Type B Homogenite is a megaturbidite of African provenance that expanded throughout the Messina and Sirte abyssal plains originating an up to 24 m thick surficial acoustically-transparent layer calibrated by coring. Type B Homogenite has a coarse and thick sandy base consisting of bioclasts deriving from the continental shelf of North Africa and is interpreted as triggered by the tsunami wave reaching the Sirte Gulf. The Dec. 26, 2004 megatsunami that hit the coastlines of SE Asia provides a real world example of how sediment dispersal can be triggered by a series of gigantic waves. Megaturbidites similar in thickness to Type B Homogenite have been recorded in all the abyssal plains of the Mediterranean, both west and east of the Ionian basin, but their age is older (late Pleistocene) and their emplacement occurred during low sea-level stands corresponding to the last glaciation. The occurrence of a Holocene megabed, postdating the Climatic Optimum, is a paradox in a paleoclimatic scenario. An exceptional event, as the megatsunami originated by the collapse of the Santorini caldera is required.RiassuntoLâ€™isola vulcanica di Santorini, che fa parte del sistema arco-fossa-bacino di retroarco del Mare Egeo, ha subito una eruzione devastante nellâ€™etÃ  del Bronzo (circa 3500 anni fa) con collasso della caldera e creazione di unâ€™onda di tsunami che Ã¨ stata convogliata in prevalenza verso ovest. La risposta sedimentaria a questo evento eccezionale in mare profondo Ã¨ stata la mobilizzazione e la rideposizione di sedimenti, chiamati Omogeniti. Dopo quasi trentâ€™anni di ricerca attiva, il data set consiste di 60 carote di mare profondo, comprese diverse carote giganti lunghe fino a 30 metri, raccolte da profonditÃ  comprese fra 4100 e 2500 m. Vengono distinti due tipi di Omogeniti. Lâ€™Omogenite di Tipo A Ã¨ costituita da torbiditi pelagiche di provenienza locale che si trovano nelle depressioni dei prismi di accrezione della Dorsale Calabra e della Dorsale Mediterranea caratterizzati dalla cosiddetta Â«Topografia a CobblestoneÂ». La posizione stratigrafica a tetto del sapropel S-1 olocenico e la base deposizionale sono interpretate come il risultato della liquefazione dei sedimenti pelagici che ricoprivano i pendii circostanti causata dal passaggio dellâ€™onda di tsunami seguita dalla deposizione al fondo dei piccoli bacini sospesi. Lâ€™Omogenite di Tipo B Ã¨ invece una megatorbidite di provenienza africana che si Ã¨ espansa al fondo delle ampie piane abissali di Messina e della Sirte dando origine a uno strato trasparente superficiale, spesso fino a 24 m, calibrato dai carotaggi. Lâ€™Omogenite di Tipo B ha una base spessa e grossolana, costituita da bioclasti provenienti dalla piattaforma continentale nordafricana, ed Ã¨ interpretata come provocata dalle onde superficiali dello tsunami che hanno raggiunto il golfo della Sirte. Il megatsunami del 26 dicembre 2004, che ha colpito le coste del SE asiatico, fornisce un esempio reale di come la dispersione dei sedimenti possa essere influenzata da onde gigantesche. Megatorbiditi di spessore simile a quello dellâ€™Omogenite di Tipo B sono state documentate in tutte le piane abissali del Mediterraneo, sia a ovest che a est del Mare Ionio, ma la loro etÃ  Ã¨ piÃ¹ antica (Pleistocene superiore) e la loro messa in posto Ã¨ avvenuta durante stazionamenti bassi del livello del mare, corrispondenti allâ€™ultima glaciazione. La presenza di una megatoribidite nellâ€™Olocene, in un periodo di alto livello del mare, Ã¨ un paradosso in uno scenario paleoclimatico: occorre un evento eccezionale come il megatsunami provocato dal collasso della caldera di Santorini per spiegame lâ€™esistenza.",2005,Rendiconti Lincei
Estimation methodology for portfolio construction under uncertainty.,"Portfolio selection is a financial decision problem faced by all investors. Private investors, companies or financial institutions need to decide on how to invest in assets by selecting a portfolio according to some optimality criterion and under possible constraints. Expressed in mathematical terms, the portfolio optimization problem involves quantities which are usually estimated from historical data. Such estimates are accompanied by uncertainty which, via the optimization process, is transferred to the investment decisions, thus rendering many portfolio estimators unstable or unreliable. This thesis approaches the problem from two angles. On the one hand, we propose an improvement of the sample moments plug-in estimator through its bootstrap distribution. A robust measure of location of this distribution results, on average, in better out-of-sample performance, especially when the original estimator exhibits high instability, as illustrated by simulations. On the other hand we propose an alternative way of choosing the optimal intensity of two shrinkage estimators. These estimators stabilize the portfolio by applying shrinkage towards desirable targets. In the first case, these targets are the conventional ones for the mean and the covariance matrix, whereas in the second case we allow for additional market information to be included. Our method again uses bootstrap resamples to account for each estimator's possible out-of-sample performance. Finally, we consider the problem from a practitioner's perspective by including transaction costs. We exploit a striking similarity between the new optimization problem and the lasso estimator, a variation of the ordinary least squares estimator. We modify accordingly and extend further an existing algorithm for the solution of this problem and present the results. The new algorithm allows for additional constraints on the model coefficients and could be useful in a regression framework when assumptions on the coefficients' sign or magnitude are made.",2004,
Fast column generation for atomic norm regularization,"We consider optimization problems that consist in minimizing a quadratic function under an atomic norm regularization or constraint. In the line of work on conditional gradient algorithms, we show that the fully corrective Frank-Wolfe (FCFW) algorithm â€” which is most naturally reformulated as a column generation algorithm in the regularized case â€” can be made particularly efficient for difficult problems in this family by solving the simplicial or conical subproblems produced by FCFW using a special instance of a classical active set algorithm for quadratic programming (Nocedal and Wright, 2006) that generalizes the min-norm point algorithm (Wolfe, 1976). Our experiments show that the algorithm takes advantages of warm-starts and of the sparsity induced by the norm, displays fast linear convergence, and clearly outperforms the state-of-the-art, for both complex and classical norms, including the standard group Lasso.",2017,

A PDF version of the profile image is obtained to send to the laser cutter company. The same process is applied for themorphed picture aswell. A 2 or 3 mm thick acrylic sheets known as Plexiglas are used to be cut by the laser cutter. These preoperative and postoperative templates are then taken into the operating theater to sterilize in an antiseptic solution or by ultraviolet light sterilization. The preoperative template is used as a reference to see if the template is exactly matching the existing profile. Then the template of the morphed image is used during and at the end of surgery",2019,Facial Plastic Surgery

Comparison of partial least squares and lasso regression techniques as applied to laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy of geological samples,"Abstract A remote laser-induced breakdown spectrometer (LIBS) designed to simulate the ChemCam instrument on the Mars Science Laboratory Rover Curiosity was used to probe 100 geologic samples at a 9-m standoff distance. ChemCam consists of an integrated remote LIBS instrument that will probe samples up to 7Â m from the mast of the rover and a remote micro-imager (RMI) that will record context images. The elemental compositions of 100 igneous and highly-metamorphosed rocks are determined with LIBS using three variations of multivariate analysis, with a goal of improving the analytical accuracy. Two forms of partial least squares (PLS) regression are employed with finely-tuned parameters: PLS-1 regresses a single response variable (elemental concentration) against the observation variables (spectra, or intensity at each of 6144 spectrometer channels), while PLS-2 simultaneously regresses multiple response variables (concentrations of the ten major elements in rocks) against the observation predictor variables, taking advantage of natural correlations between elements. Those results are contrasted with those from the multivariate regression technique of the l east a bsolute s hrinkage and s election o perator (lasso), which is a penalized shrunken regression method that selects the specific channels for each element that explain the most variance in the concentration of that element. To make this comparison, we use results of cross-validation and of held-out testing, and employ unscaled and uncentered spectral intensity data because all of the input variables are already in the same units. Results demonstrate that the lasso, PLS-1, and PLS-2 all yield comparable results in terms of accuracy for this dataset. However, the interpretability of these methods differs greatly in terms of fundamental understanding of LIBS emissions. PLS techniques generate principal components, linear combinations of intensities at any number of spectrometer channels, which explain as much variance in the response variables as possible while avoiding multicollinearity between principal components. When the selected number of principal components is projected back into the original feature space of the spectra, 6144 correlation coefficients are generated, a small fraction of which are mathematically significant to the regression. In contrast, the lasso models require only a small number (",2012,Spectrochimica Acta Part B: Atomic Spectroscopy

Penalized variable selection for accelerated failure time models with random effects.,"Accelerated failure time (AFT) models allowing for random effects are linear mixed models under the log-transformation of survival time with censoring and describe dependence in correlated survival data. It is well known that the AFT models are useful alternatives to frailty models. To the best of our knowledge, however, there is no literature on variable selection methods for such AFT models. In this paper, we propose a simple but unified variable-selection procedure of fixed effects in the AFT random-effect models using penalized h-likelihood (HL). We consider four penalty functions (ie, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), adaptive LASSO, smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD), and HL). We show that the proposed method can be easily implemented via a slight modification to existing h-likelihood estimation procedures. We thus demonstrate that the proposed method can also be easily extended to AFT models with multilevel (or nested) structures. Simulation studies also show that the procedure using the adaptive LASSO, SCAD, or HL penalty performs well. In particular, we find via the simulation results that the variable selection method with HL penalty provides a higher probability of choosing the true model than other three methods. The usefulness of the new method is illustrated using two actual datasets from multicenter clinical trials.",2019,Statistics in medicine

Application of variable selection and dimension reduction on predictors of MSEâ€™s development,"Nature create variables using its character component, and variables are sharing characters from a vary small to relatively large scale. This results, variables to have from a vary different to a more similar character, and leads to have a relation ship. Literature suggested different relation measures based on the nature of variable and type of relation ship exist. Today, due to having high variety of frequently produced large data size, currently suggested variable filtering and selection methods have gaps to full fill the need. This research desires to fill this gap by comparing literature suggested methods to finding out a better variable selection and dimension reduction methods. The result from regression analysis using all literature suggested factors shows that none of the predictors for development status of enterprise are significant, and only 10 predictors for number of employer in an enterprise are significant out of 81 factors. Since, variable selection and dimension reduction methods are applied to find out predictors of a response by removing variable redundancy, and complexity of incorporating large number variable. Based on statistical power, for the results from variable selection methods, specially association and correlation methods showed that, CANOVA more efficiently detects non-linear or non-monotonic correlation between a continuousâ€“continuous and a continuous-categorical variables. Spearmanâ€™s correlation coefficient more efficiently detects a monotonic correlation between a continuous with a continuous, and a continuous with a categorical variable. Pearson correlation coefficient more efficiently detects the linear correlation between continuous variables. MIC efficiently detects non-linear or non-monotonic relation between continuous variables. Chi-square test of independence efficiently detects relation between a continuous with a continuous, and categorical with categorical variables, but the non linear or non monotonic relation between a continuous with a categorical are not well detected. On the other hand, the result from lasso and stepwise methods reveals that, the relation between the predictor and response due to interaction effect not detected by correlation and association methods are detected by stepwise variable selection method, and the multicollinearity is detected and removed by lasso method. Regressing the response variable â€œnumber of employer in an enterpriseâ€ based on variables selected by lasso and stepwise method does bring greater model fitness (based on adjusted R-squared value) than variables selected by association and correlation methods. Similarly, regressing the response variable â€œdevelopment status of an enterpriseâ€ based on variables selected by association and correlation methods does bring 12 significant variables, where none of variables are significant from variables selected by lasso and stepwise methods. As a result, 51 predictors for number of employment in an enterprise, and 40 predictors for development status of an enterprise are detected as significantly related variables. And, lasso and stepwise methods are preferred to select predictors of a continuous response variable â€œnumber of employers in an enterpriseâ€, and association and correlation methods are preferred to select predictors of a categorical response variable â€œdevelopment status of an enterpriseâ€. Finally, the reduced regression models result reveals that, 20 predictors have causal relation with number of employment in an enterprise, and 12 predictors have causal relation with development status of an enterprise. On the other hand, based on model fitness, information lost, and number of significant factors, principal factor is preferred and applied in dimension reduction for a categorical response variable â€œdevelopment status of an enterpriseâ€, and factor score based regression is preferred and applied for a continuous response variable â€œnumber of employers in an enterpriseâ€. However, the comparison of the results in variable selection and dimension reduction indicates that, variable selection methods gave more gain in model fitness than dimension reduction methods. Hence, the suggested variable selection methods are more preferred than dimension reduction methods, and applied to find out predictors. In general, the suggested procedure for variable selection methods are recommended when small number of variables are studied, and the suggested dimension reduction methods are recommended for large number of variant variables (Big data case).",2018,Journal of Big Data
Tumor-infiltrating immune cells signature predicts recurrence free survival after complete resection of localized primary gastrointestinal stromal tumors,"Background: Growing evidence has proposed prognostic value of immune infiltration in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). Therefore, we aimed to develop a novel immune-based prognostic classifier (IPC) to help better stratify and predict prognosis of GISTs. Methods: The gene expression profiles of 22 immune features of GISTs were detected from GEO dataset. The IPC was constructed using the LASSO Cox regression model and validated in a cohort including 54 patients with complete resection of localized primary GISTs via immunohistochemistry process. The performance assessment of the IPC was estimated, then compared with conventional risk prognostic criteria. Results: The IPC was established based on 4 features: CD8, CD8/CD3, CD68, CD163/CD68 and validated to be an independent predictor of RFS for GISTs (HR 5.2, 95%CI 1.99-13.65). Significant differences were found between low- and high-IPC group in 5-year RFS (92.6% vs 48.1%, p < 0.001). Using the IPC, the high-risk group of the Modified NIH classification was split into two groups in 5-year RFS (low-IPC vs high-IPC, 85.7% vs 30.0%, p < 0.001). The IPC showed a higher net benefit than both ""treat all"" or ""treat none"" methods for the threshold probability within a range of 0-0.62 and exhibited a performance (AUC 0.842) superior to modified NIH classification (AUC 0.763). Conclusion: The IPC was effective to predict RFS after complete resection of localized primary GISTs, adding prognostic value to the routine clinical prognostic criteria. Prospective studies are needed to further validate the analytical accuracy and practicability of the IPC in estimating prognosis of GISTs.",2020,medRxiv
Modified-INSAT Multi-Spectral Rainfall Algorithm (M-IMSRA) at climate region scale: Development and validation,"Abstract The present article reports an improvement in the INSAT Multispectral Rainfall Algorithm which is currently operational in the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD). The proposed Modified-IMSRA (M-IMSRA) algorithm deviates from original IMSRA in two ways: first is by improvement in rain/no-rain area detection scheme using a Multi-Index Rain Detection (MIRD) index; second is based on the climate region-wise correction through Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) models developed for each climate regions using rainfall (obtained based on first improvement) and static topographic variables extracted from Digital Elevation Model (DEM). The overall results indicate that the M-IMSRA is performing better than the IMSRA in all climatic regions when compared with the IMD gridded gauge data. However, the improvement is not uniform in all the regions. The inclusion of the MIRD index led to considerable improvement in M-IMSRA-based rainfall estimates mainly in the arid regions. Likewise, the results obtained after the LASSO regression corrections indicate that they are necessary only for the orographic regions where significant improvements are observed in the rainfall estimates. Finally, the inter-comparison of the simple hybrid M-IMSRA estimates with Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B42 V7 and TRMM 3B42-RT V7 illustrates that the M-IMSRA performs nearly as well as even better (except in terms of Correlation Coefficient) than the complex multi-satellite-based rainfall estimates in all the climate regions of India. Considering the above results, it can be said that the performance of simple hybrid algorithms such as IMSRA can be improved to match the quality or even outperform complex multi-satellite rainfall estimates by incorporating appropriate corrections.",2016,Remote Sensing of Environment

L1-graph construction using structured sparsity,"Abstract As a powerful model to represent the data, graph has been widely applied to many machine learning tasks. More notably, to address the problems associated with the traditional graph construction methods, sparse representation has been successfully used for graph construction, and one typical work is L 1 -graph. However, since L 1 -graph often establishes only part of all the valuable connections between different data points due to its tendency to ignore the intrinsic structure hidden among the data, it fails to exploit such important information for the subsequent machine learning. Besides, the high computational costs of L 1 -graph prevent it from being applied to large scale high-dimensional datasets. In this paper, we construct a new graph, called the k -nearest neighbor ( k -NN) fused Lasso graph, which is different from the traditional L 1 -graph because of its successful incorporation of the structured sparsity into the graph construction process and its applicability to large complex datasets. More concretely, to induce the structured sparsity, a novel regularization term is defined and reformulated into a matrix form to fit in the sparse representation step of L 1 -graph construction, and the k -NN method and kernel method are employed to deal with large complex datasets. Experimental results on several complex image datasets demonstrate the promising performance of our k -NN fused Lasso graph and also its advantage over the traditional L 1 -graph in the task of spectral clustering.",2013,Neurocomputing
Evolution of coral reef fish Thalassoma spp. (Labridae). 1. Molecular phylogeny and biogeography,"Wrasses in the genus Thalassoma comprise 27 recognized species that occur predominantly on coral reefs and subtropical rocky reefs worldwide. The phylogenetic relationships for 26 species were examined based on two mitochondrial genes (cytochromeÂ b and 16S rRNA) and one nuclear intron (the first intron of the ribosomal protein S7). Two closely related species, the bird-wrasses (Gomphosus varius LacepÃ¨de, 1801 and G. caerulaeus LacepÃ¨de, 1801), were also included in the analysis. These species grouped within the genus Thalassoma. Thalassoma newtoni (OsÃ³rio, 1891) from Sao Tome, which is generally synonymized with the Atlantic/Mediterranean Thalassoma pavo (Linnaeus, 1758) appears to be a valid species. Using a molecular clock, the genus was estimated to have originally diverged 8â€“13Â million years ago, with Thalassoma ballieui (Vaillant and Sauvage, 1875) from Hawaii and Thalassoma septemfasciata Scott, 1959 from Western Australia as the ancestral species. Approximately 5â€“10Â million years ago, a sudden burst of speciation resulted in seven clades, which were resolved with the sequence data. The terminal Tethyan event and the closing of the Isthmus of Panama were probably the major historical factors shaping the evolution of species in the genus Thalassoma. These data on the spatio-temporal pattern of speciation in the Indo-Pacific indicate that peripheral species have been generated at various times throughout the history of the genus, and that none of the widespread species are relatively young. Thus, there is no clear support for centrifugal (youngest at the periphery) versus centripetal (oldest at the periphery) modes of generation of species, two theories which have been used to account for geographic gradients in species diversity.",2004,Marine Biology
Inflation Forecasting Using Machine Learning Methods,"Inflation forecasting is an important practical problem. This paper proposes a solution to this problem for Russia using several basic machine learning methods: LASSO, Ridge, Elastic Net, Random Forest, and Boosting. Despite the fact that these methods already existed in the early 2000s, for a long time they remained almost unnoticed in the professional literature related to the forecasting of inflation in general, and Russian inflation in particular. This paper is one of the first attempts to apply machine learning methods to the forecasting of inflation in Russia. The present empirical study demostrates that the Random Forest model and the Boosting model are at least as good at inflation forecasting as more traditional models, such as Random Walk and autoregression. The main result of this paper is the confirmation of the possibility of more accurate forecasting of inflation in Russia using machine learning methods.",2018,
Joint burst LASSO for sparse channel estimation in multi-user massive MIMO,"The knowledge of CSI at the BS (CSIT) is required to achieve the high spectrum efficiency promised by massive MIMO. In Frequency-Division Duplex (FDD) Massive MIMO systems, the CSIT is obtained via downlink channel estimation and uplink channel feedback, However, the acquisition of CSIT is a very challenging problem in practical FDD massive MIMO systems with a large number of antennas. Recently, compressive sensing has been applied to reduce pilot and CSIT feedback overheads in massive MIMO systems by exploiting the underlying channel sparsity. However, standard sparse recovery algorithms have stringent requirement on the channel sparsity level for robust channel recovery and this severely limits the operating regime of the solution. To overcome this issue, we propose a joint burst LASSO algorithm to exploit additional joint burst-sparse structure in multi-user (MU) massive MIMO channels. Simulations show that the joint burst LASSO algorithm can alleviate the stringent requirement on the sparsity level for robust channel recovery and substantially enhance the channel estimation performance over existing solutions.",2016,2016 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)

Human agency and the formation of tableware distribution patterns in Hellenistic Greece and Asia Minor,"This thesis utilizes ceramic legacy data to examine the influence of human agency upon the formation of tableware distribution patterns in Hellenistic Greece and Asia Minor. The formation of distribution patterns is a neglected area in Hellenistic pottery studies; differences between sites are usually taken at face value, paying scant attention to the human choices and behaviours responsible for observed variations.
Tableware from Athens and New Halos in Greece and Ilion, Ephesus, Sardis, Gordion and Sagalassos in Asia Minor is employed for comparative analysis. Agency and network theory is utilized, along with a close reading of the wider contextual background of the case-studies, to explore local consumer choices and address distributional differences. This approach is enabled by the systematic collection of tableware data in the ICRATES database.
This research shows that differences between sites, in terms of tableware consumption, can only be understood as reflecting human behaviour and choice. It is demonstrated that New Halos focused on Hellenistic shapes of more â€˜Classicalâ€™ appearance and relied primarily for its tableware supply upon the wider region. Athens principally used local tableware focusing on a more properly Hellenistic repertoire, but an antiquated shape like the bolsal was produced specifically for the foreign market. Ilion, Ephesus, Sardis and Sagalassos similarly made different choices in tableware production and consumption. Observed differences relate to preferences, practices, and opportunities. Consumption at Ilion is influenced by Pergamum, whereas Ephesus develops a repertoire partly specific to itself. At Sagalassos producers and consumers used a repertoire which, while distinct and building upon local traditions, forms part of more widely shared tableware preferences. This study shows that within a general pottery koine various sub-koinai existed and interacted, reflecting varying contextualized choices. The results have important and wide-ranging implications for current approaches to cultural interaction, material culture and society.",2014,
"Sedimentology and palynofacies analysis of Jurassic rocks Eriksdal, SkÃ¥ne, Sweden","A sedimentlogical and palynological study of samples from the Middle Jurassic Fuglunda Member, Mariedal Formation at Eriksdal, Skane, Sweden, has been carried out. The section is dominated by sandstone with minor units of coal, claystone, siltstone and conglomerate. The depositional environment has been interpreted as a coastal setting, perhaps a delta system with mixed influences of fluvial, tidal and wave processes. Twenty-four samples processed for the palynological study revealed rich and well-preserved assemblages of dispersed organic matter but their composition varies significantly. Forty-two pollen and spore species were identified. Wood remains, amorphous organic matter, cuticles and fungal spores were also recorded in the samples. The coal samples have almost the same palynomorph content as samples from adjacent clastic sediments, except 23A and 23B, which are devoid of pollen and spores. The Fuglunda member palynoflora is dominated by gymnosperms, most notably Perinopollenites elatoides. Most of the species are long-ranging; however, a few species are stratigraphically significant (Neoraistrickia gristhorpensis, Todisporites minor, Callialasporites microvelatus). These index taxa suggest that the studied samples are of Bajocianâ€“Bathonian (Middle Jurassic) age. The occurrence of the key environmental indices Gleicheniidites senonicus, Cyathidites, Classopollis and Perinopollenites suggests a warm and humid palaeoclimate for the Eriksdal area. The composition of the Fuglunda member palynoflora, together with its Thermal Alteration Index (TAI = 2) and Spore Colour Index (SCI = 4), reveal that the organic matter is gas-prone and is immature to produce hydrocarbons.",2013,
Pattern-based local linear regression models for short-term load forecasting,"Abstract In this paper univariate models for short-term load forecasting based on linear regression and patterns of daily cycles of load time series are proposed. The patterns used as input and output variables simplify the forecasting problem by filtering out the trend and seasonal variations of periods longer than the daily one. The nonstationarity in mean and variance is also eliminated. The simplified relationship between variables (patterns) is modeled locally in the neighborhood of the current input using linear regression. The load forecast is constructed from the forecasted output pattern and the current values of variables describing the load time series. The proposed stepwise and lasso regressions reduce the number of predictors to a few. In the principal components regression and partial least-squares regression only one predictor is used. This allows us to visualize the data and regression function. The performances of the proposed methods were compared with that of other models based on ARIMA, exponential smoothing, neural networks and Nadarayaâ€“Watson estimator. Application examples confirm valuable properties of the proposed approaches and their high accuracy.",2016,Electric Power Systems Research
Genomic organization and expression of mouse thymic shared antigen-1 (TSA-1): evidence for a processed pseudogene,"The mouse TSA-1 molecule, also known as stem cell antigen-2 (Sca-2) is expressed on thymocytes, thymic dendritic cells, B cells, and activated T cells (Aihara et al. 1986; Godfrey et al. 1992; Vremec et al. 1992; Kosugi et al. 1994). TSA-1 is a member of the Ly-6 superfamily (Ly-6SF) of small, cysteine-rich proteins (MacNeil et al. 1993; Classon and Coverdale, 1994), most of which are glycosylphosphatidyl inositol (GPI)-anchored leukocyte surface proteins (Rock et al. 1989). TSA-1 expression in the thymus is of particular interest, since it is upregulated early in T-cell development, approximately when lymphoid commitment occurs (Wu et al. 1991). Blockade of TSA-1 in vitro with monoclonal antibodies has suggested important roles for the molecule in thymocyte development (Randle et al. 1993) and in mature T-cell responses to antigen (Kosugi et al. 1994, Saitoh et al. 1995). To further characterize the regulation of TSA-1 expression and the role of TSA-1 in leucocyte function, we investigated the genomic organization of the mouseTSA-1gene ( Tsa1). A 129/SVJ strain mouse genomic phage library was screened with aTSA-1 cDNA probe and a total of ten independent phage clones were isolated and ordered into two groups by restriction mapping. Selected restriction fragments from both groups of phage clones were sequenced and compared with the cDNA sequence. Tsa1 is segregated into four exons which are flanked by appropriate consensus acceptor or donor splice sites (Fig. 1). The first exon is untranslated and is separated from exon 2 by a 2059 base pair (bp) intron. Exon 2 contains the remainder of the 59 untranslated (UT) sequence (49 bp) followed by 52 bp of coding region, including the initiator methionine codon, and which codes for most of the N-terminal leader sequence. Exon 3 (120 bp) is separated from exon 2 by an intron of 391 bp and codes for the remainder of the leader sequence and 37 amino acids of the mature protein. Exon 3 is separated from exon 4 by an intron of 104 bp. Exon 4 encodes the remaining amino acids of the protein (including the GPI signal sequence), and is followed by the 3 9UT r gion and the consensus polyadenylation signal. No differnces were found between the genomic exon sequences and the cDNA sequence described previously (Classon and Coverdale, 1994). Transcription initiation start sites of Tsa1 were determined by 59 RACE (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) using thymus and kidney RNA templates. The start of exon 1 (nucleotide 701, Figure 1) was assigned according to the sequence of the longest 5 9 cDNA obtained (kidney). Other transcription initiation sites were found at positions 705 (kidney), 706 and 712 (thymus). TheTsa1 transcription start site at position 701 matches well with a previously described initiator (Inr) motif sufficient for transcription of genes that lack a TATA box (Smale and Baltimore, 1989). A second group of genomic clones each contained a 0.9 kil base (kb) Xba I probe-reactive restriction fragment which was sequenced and found to be 84% homologous to the TSA-1cDNA sequence (Fig. 2). The open reading frame of theTsa1-related sequence ( Tsa1-rs1) lacked the introns found inTsa1and contained 59 base substitutions giving rise to 33 amino acid changes compared with the TSA-1 cDNA and protein sequences. A premature stop codon four amino acids into the GPI signal sequence and a deletion of 6 nucleotides encoding a Cys-Cys dipeptide near the C-terminus of the mature TSA-1 protein were also found. It was possible that Tsa1-rs1could encode a secreted homologue of the TSA-1 protein, which probably would have altered tertiary structure, since it is known that the Cys-Cys motif absent inTsa1-rs1is important for stabilizing the tertiary structure of the Ly-6SF molecule CD59 (Kieffer et al. 1994). To address this issue, the expression pattern of both loci was investigated by northern blot analysis with gene-specific oligonucleotide probes (Fig. 3A). A hybridization signal was seen with the probe specific for Tsa1 in a number of tissues including thymus The nucleotide sequence data reported in this manuscript have been submitted to the EMBL/Genbank sequence databases and have been assigned the accession numbers U47737 and U47850",2007,Immunogenetics

Reducing the number of reconstructions needed for estimating channelized observer performance,"A challenge for task-based optimization is the time required for each reconstructed image in applications where reconstructions are time consuming. Our goal is to reduce the number of reconstructions needed to estimate the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the infinitely-trained optimal channelized linear observer. We explore the use of classifiers which either do not invert the channel covariance matrix or do feature selection. We also study the assumption that multiple low contrast signals in the same image of a non-linear reconstruction do not significantly change the estimate of the AUC. We compared the AUC of several classifiers (Hotelling, logistic regression, logistic regression using Firth bias reduction and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)) with a small number of observations both for normal simulated data and images from a total variation reconstruction in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We used 10 Laguerre-Gauss channels and the Mann-Whitney estimator for AUC. For this data, our results show that at small sample sizes feature selection using the LASSO technique can decrease bias of the AUC estimation with increased variance and that for large sample sizes the difference between these classifiers is small. We also compared the use of multiple signals in a single reconstructed image to reduce the number of reconstructions in a total variation reconstruction for accelerated imaging in MRI. We found that AUC estimation using multiple low contrast signals in the same image resulted in similar AUC estimates as doing a single reconstruction per signal leading to a 13x reduction in the number of reconstructions needed.",2018,
