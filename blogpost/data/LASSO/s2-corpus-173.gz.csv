"Short-term virological efficacy, immune reconstitution, tolerance, and adherence of once-daily dosing of didanosine, lamivudine, and efavirenz in HIV-1-infected African children: ANRS 12103 Burkiname.","Access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and routine laboratory monitoring are limited for HIV-1-infected children from sub-Saharan Africa. This trial conducted in Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso, aimed to describe the biological efficacy, tolerance, and adherence of the combination of didanosine, lamivudine, efavirenz in once-daily administration among eligible HIV-1-infected children. From February 2006 to November 2007, 51 HIV-1-infected children aged from 30 months to 15 years and eligible for ART were enrolled in a phase II open clinical trial with follow-up visits every 3 months. HIV-1 genotype testing was performed in children with plasma viral load (PVL) >1000 copies per milliliter after ART initiation. Children were followed for a median of 13.4 months [interquartile range (IQR) 12.8-14.2]. At enrollment, median CD4 count was 8% (IQR = 4.5-12). PVL was 341,032 (IQR = 127,838-761,539) copies per milliliter. At 12 months, median CD4 increased significantly by +15% (P < 10(-3)), and median PVL decreases significantly by -290,500 copies per milliliter (P < 10(-4)). Hemoglobin and platelets counts increased significantly by +1.05 g/dL (P < 10(-5)) and 108,500 cells per milliliter (P < 10(-3)), respectively. Based on pill count, mean yearly adherence was 97.3%, and 48% of the children had an adherence rate â‰¥ 95% at the four quarterly visits. Adherence was better for girls than for boys independently of other sociodemographic variables or markers of HIV disease progression. Drug-resistant mutations were found in 11 children (21.6%). This once-daily drug combination is associated with excellent virological efficacy, immune reconstitution, and good adherence. However, the high prevalence of drug resistance mutations is a matter of concern.",2011,Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes
Identifying important factors affecting O2O customers trust from textual reviews,"Recently, O2O (Online to Offline/Offline to Online) business model is growing rapidly. While selecting a service from various options, many researchers pointed out that customersâ€˜ trust is an important issue. To grow business, it is necessary to enhance the customerâ€™s trust on O2O platforms. In previous studies, questionnaire survey data was used to find crucial factors. But gathering survey from customers need manpower and time. Moreover, customersâ€™ comments are restricted by the set of questions, and could not describe their thoughts explicitly. In this work. We use textual comments by customer as source data to find important factors.The textual review data obtained over internet contains more positive review than negative. This imbalance in data, when used for classifier, gives high classification score for positive reviews but fail to identify negative reviews. We found, through experiments, that balancing data before feature selection as well as while training the classifier gives highest score for overall classification, the geometric mean of positive and negative accuracies. We used LASSO for feature selection and undersampling to create balanced data. Results before and after balancing data are shown. The selected features specigy the understanding of service provider, where they should emphasize for increased trust and therefore enhance their business.",2018,2018 9th International Conference on Awareness Science and Technology (iCAST)

"Systematics and host-plant associations of the Palassocoris complex (Insectaâ€‰:â€‰Heteropteraâ€‰:â€‰Miridaeâ€‰:â€‰Orthotylinae), a monophyletic suprageneric group of long-headed Australian Orthotylini, and the description of five new genera and 10 new species","Abstract. The Australian plant bug family Miridae is hyperdiverse in Australia, including a remarkable radiation of undescribed species belonging to the tribe Orthotylini. This study includes a comparative morphological and phylogenetic study of a group of orthotylines, mostly associated with woody shrubs. Parsimony-based analysis of 49 morphological characters was undertaken, resulting in the recognition of a monophyletic supraspecific group with elongate heads, the Palassocoris complex, as well as three monophyletic genera with multiple species, and two monotypic genera. Five new genera (Austroloxops, gen. nov., Harpemiris, gen. nov., Hypospicula, gen. nov., Palassocoris, gen. nov. and Wallagootacoris, gen. nov.) and 10 species (Austroloxops juriensis, sp. nov., Harpemiris hibbertiaphila, sp. nov., Hypospicula banksiaphila, sp. nov., Hypospicula finkensis, sp. nov., Palassocoris elongatus, sp. nov., Palassocoris emuensis, sp. nov., Palassocoris jambrecinae, sp. nov., Palassocoris samphirensis, sp. nov., Wallagootacoris schwartzi, sp. nov., Wallagootacoris tasmaniensis, sp. nov.) are described as new to science. The Palassocoris complex was found to be the sister-group to two species of the Lattinova complex, the latter previously assigned to the tribe Austromirini, rendering the Orthotylini as paraphyletic. The classificatory implications of this finding are discussed.",2018,Invertebrate Systematics
Interval multiple-output soft sensors development with capacity control for wastewater treatment applications: A comparative study,"Abstract Soft-sensor is the most common strategy to predict hard-to-measure variables in the wastewater treatment processes. However, existence of a large number of hard-to-measure variables always renders a generic single-output soft-sensor inadequate. This study developed multi-output soft-sensors using Multivariate Linear Regression model (MLR), Multivariate Relevant Vector Machine (MRVM) and Multivariate Gaussian Processes Regression (MGPR) models aiming to predict multiple hard-to-measure variables simultaneously and to capture the joint distribution of the response variables. This, in turn, ensures that the proposed soft-sensors are not just able to obtain prediction values, but also to indicate the credibility of information for hard-to-measure quantities. To further compromise the computational overhead of multi-output soft-sensors, improved Variable Importance in Projection (VIP) and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Lasso) are proposed to reduce the dimensions of data, thereby alleviating the complexity of predicted models. The proposed methodologies were firstly demonstrated by applying the design algorithm to a wastewater plant (WWTP) simulated with the well-established model, BSM1, then extended to a full-scale WWTP with data collecting from the field. Results showed that the proposed strategy significantly improved the prediction performance.",2019,Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems
Phylogeny and Comparative Ecology of Stiff-tailed Ducks (anatidae: Oxyurini),"A cladistic analysis of the stiff-tailed ducks (Anatidae: Oxyurini) was con- ducted using 92 morphological characters. The analysis produced one minimum-length, completely dichotomous phylogenetic tree of high consistency (consistency index for infor- mative characters, 0.74). Monophyly of the tribe was supported by 17 unambiguous syna- pomorphies. Within the tribe, Heteronetta (1 species) is the sister-group of other members; within the latter clade (supported by 2 1 unambiguous synapomorphies), Nomonyx (1 species) is the sister-group of Oxyura (6 species) + Biziura (I species). The latter clade is supported by 10 unambiguous synapomorphies. Monophyly of Oxyuru proper is supported by three unambiguous synapomorphies. All branches in the shortest tree except that uniting Oxyuva, exclusive of jumaicensis, were conserved in a majority-rule consensus tree of 1000 boot- strapped replicates. Biziuru and (to a lesser extent) Heteronetta were highly autapomorphic. Modest evolutionary patterns in body mass, reproductive parameters, and sexual dimorphism are evident, with the most marked, correlated changes occurring in Heteronetta and (es- pecially) Biziura. The implications of these evolutionary trends for reproductive ecology and biogeographic patterns are discussed, and a phylogenetic classification of the tribe is presented. Received 27 April 1994, accepted 10 Nov. 1994. The stiff-tailed ducks (Anatidae: Oxyurini) include some of the most distinctive species of waterfowl; among its members are the only obligate nest-parasite (Black-headed Duck; Heteronetta atricapilla) and the spe- cies showing the greatest sexual size dimorphism (Musk Duck; Biziuru lobz Johnsgard 1962, 1978; Weller 1968; Livezey 1986). Members of the Oxyurini are foot-propelled diving birds (Townsend 1909, Brooks 1945, Tome and Wrubleski 1988) and range in diving ability from the largely surface-feeding Black-headed Duck to the highly specialized Musk Duck (Raikow 1970, 1973; Livezey 1986). Stiff-tailed ducks generally inhabit freshwater lakes and marshes, typically construct over-water nests, and occur in most major land areas worldwide (Delacour 1959; Weller 1964a-d; Johnsgard 1978). Since the reclassification of the White-backed Duck (Dendrocygninae: Thalassornis leuconotus) on behavioral and morphological grounds (Johnsgard 1967; Raikow 1971; Livezey 1986, 1995), systematic contro- versies concerning the stiff-tailed ducks have focused on the tribal posi- tion of the Black-headed Duck, currently considered to be a comparatively primitive member of the Oxyurini (e.g., Salvadori 1895; Phillips 1925, 1926; Peters 1931; Boetticher 1942, 1952; Delacour and Mayr 1945; Ver-",1995,The Wilson Journal of Ornithology
Analyzing the amperometric response of a glucose oxidase sensor applying mathematical models,"Background: The biosensors are analytical devices combining a bioreceptor and a physicochemical transducer to translate the signal resulting from the interaction of the analyte with the biological element into an electrical reading. The technological attractiveness of the biosensors resides in their high sensitivity, continuous measuring capabilities, low cost, and precision. An important and promising area of biosensors application is the associated with blood glucose levels monitoring in diabetic patients. However, accuracy and stability issues are still under development, impeding the more widespread offering of glucose biosensors in the market. Thus, this work aims to contribute to the biosensors technology by analyzing the amperometric response to glucose of a typical glucose oxidase-based sensor of second generation, applying mathematical models. 
 
Methods: The amperometric response of the glucose oxidase-based electrochemical sensor of second generation was analyzed under different conditions such as temperature, pH, mediatorsâ€™ and substrateâ€™s concentrations through statistical learning methods from a regression perspective. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), LASSO and RIDGE Regression and Classification and Regression (CART) were the algorithms selected to achieve the regression task. 
 
Results: The reported experimental results show a promising very low prediction error of the biosensor output by using Neural Networks and Classification and Regression Trees. It is also shown that the relationship between predictors, i.e. features or variables- and response-target variable- corresponds to a nonlinear behavior. 
 
Conclusion: A final CART and a Neural Network models are presented as a simple solutions that can be solidly constructed in order to predict the amperometric response of a glucose oxidase sensor. The experimental proposal and conditions offered in this paper could be applied for other scenarios in the wide spectrum of biosensing technology.",2016,Current Analytical Chemistry
The efficient sensitization of Sm(III) ion by a macrocycle with the matched cavity and energy level,"Abstract A series of mononuclear lanthanide(III) coordination compounds Ln-1a with the â€œlasso-typeâ€ protection have been synthesized based on the flexible [1+1] pendant-arm Schiff-base macrocyclic ligand H2L1a. X-ray structure analysis reveals that the central ten-coordinate Ln(III) ion in every compound adopts distorted bicapped square antiprism geometry which is surrounded by one macrocycle and two axial chelating nitrates. Photophysical measurements have demonstrated that the macrocyclic ligand can serve as an effective sensitizer for Sm(III) ion. The relative compound Sm-1a shows efficient luminescence. Especially, the quantum yields are as high as about 1.48Â±0.03 and 0.24Â±0.02 % for Sm(III) ion in solid state and methanol, respectively. The fluorescence lifetime is 42.3 Î¼s in solid state together with 24.5 Î¼s in methanol. It is proposed that the macrocyclic ligand plays an important role in guaranteeing the effective match of energy levels for Sm(III) central ion and constructing unique cavity microenvironment to shield the Sm(III) ion emitter from possible quenching effects.",2019,Polyhedron
"Large group practices lag in adopting patient-centered ""medical home"" model.","first-year residency positions in radiology and 93.8% of those in orthopedic surgery, and the average starting salaries in these fields were the greatest, exceeding $400 000. Ebell had reported a similar trend in 1989 (Ebell MH. JAMA. 1989;262[12]:1630). With the average medical student now graduating with more than $140 000 in student loan debt, the draw of lucrative specialties that will pay 2 to 3 times what primary care pays is strong, said Colwill. He emphasized the importance of changing the way primary care physicians are reimbursed to make the field more lucrative and, in doing so, more attractive to medical school graduates. He cited the medical home model, in which primary care physicians are reimbursed for managing their patientsâ€™ overall care and coordinating their specialist care, as one means of improving pay. Ricketts added that attention needs to be paid to improve the way physicians are reimbursed across specialties. He emphasized that reimbursement for care should be adjusted based on the value of the service to the patient and the cost of that intervention. Factors other than pay may also make primary care an unattractive career choice for medical students. A recent survey of 1177 4th-year medical students found that many had unfavorable perceptions of the lifestyle and type of work involved in primary care (Hauer KE et al. JAMA. 2008;300[10]:1154-1164). Toovercomethe inequitabledistribution of primary care clinicians, the NationalAssociationofCommunityHealth CentersadvocatesexpandingtheNational Health Services Corps (NHSC), which provides scholarships and student loan reimbursement for clinicians who agree to work in underserved areas for a minimum of 2 years. About half of these individualsworkatcommunityhealthcenters. The AAMC also supports doubling thenumberof cliniciansparticipating in the program, to 1500 each year. Hawkins noted that participation in the NHSC for 4 or more years greatly increases the likelihood that a physician will continue to work in an underserved area after leaving the program. Ongoing efforts to expand the supply of physicians will not be sufficient to prevent the projected shortage of primary care physicians, or to address the shortage of physicians across specialties, Salsberg acknowledged. Efforts must also be made to increase the number of nurse practitioners and physician assistants, and to redesign the way care is delivered to make more effective use of the physicians available, he said. Colwill said that expanding the supply of primary care physicians will benefit physicians in all specialties. â€œAs the shortage increases, it is going to throw more primary medical care to specialists who donâ€™t see that as their primary role,â€ he said. â€œItâ€™s in everyoneâ€™s best interest to foster increases in the number of primary care physicians.â€",2008,JAMA

The proposed method is initiated by a re-weighted Lasso approach, and then use an iterative relaxation-based refining step to allow for high resolution estimates. The resulting estimates are found to be statistically efficient, achieving the CrameÌr-Rao lower bound.

Composition chimique et qualitÃ© bactÃ©riologique des laits crus et pasteurisÃ©s au Burkina Faso,"Les parametres physico-chimiques et bacteriologiques du lait sont dâ€™une grande importance dans lâ€™appreciation de la qualite du lait cru et des produits laitiers. Au Burkina Faso, la connaissance de ces parametres du lait fait beaucoup defaut a lâ€™echelle des fermes et des unites de transformation. Les prelevements se sont deroules suivant deux conditions dâ€™hygiene dâ€™Aout a Septembre 2012. La premiere etant celle pratiquee habituellement par la ferme tandis que la seconde sâ€™est faite dans les conditions experimentales dâ€™hygiene recommandee. Au total 60 sachets de laits pasteurises ont ete preleves a raison de 15 sachets par unite de transformation. Pour le lait cru, un volume de 30 mL a ete preleve a partir des trayons des vaches dans une ferme les matins et les soirs par trayon en mi-chemin de la traite ainsi quâ€™a la fin de la traite. La composition chimique des laits a ete determinee par la methode infrarouge (Farm Milk Analyser Miris, AB Sweden, 2001), le pH a lâ€™aide dâ€™un pH-metre et les cellules somatiques par la technique de fluorescence (Delaval Cell Counter, Tumba, Sweden). Farm milk analyser a ete calibre quand il a sâ€™agit de lâ€™analyse des laits pasteurises. La culture des Staphylococcus aureus et Escherichia coli a ete faite dans la gelose Baird Parker et la gelose Lactosee au Cristal Violet et au Rouge Neutre. Quant a la flore aerobie mesophile totale, la culture sâ€™est faite avec la gelose plate count agar. Lâ€™analyse des variances a ete appliquee aux donnees pour lâ€™analyse statistique a lâ€™aide de Minitab version 15. Les resultats obtenus a partir des laits pasteurises des quatre unites de transformation ont montre des taux de matieres proteiques et de lactose differents dâ€™un lait pasteurise a un autre (p Ë‚ 0,05). Le taux de la flore aerobie totale etait de 116*10 3 ufc/mL dans le lait cru de ferme et de 18*10 3 ufc/mL dans le lait pasteurise des unites de transformation. Le lait cru preleve dans les conditions habituelles dâ€™hygiene de la ferme a presente une charge bacterienne plus eleve (10 6 ufc/mL, valeur maximale) que celle du lait provenant de la bonne methode dâ€™hygiene qui a son tour a presente une charge bacterienne (10 5 ufc/mL, valeur maximale) plus eleve que celle des laits pasteurises issus des unites de transformation (10 4 ufc/mL; valeur maximale). En conclusion, une bonne pratique dâ€™hygiene peut permettre de reduire la charge bacterienne du lait cru et la pasteurisation permet aussi dâ€™eliminer la majeure partie des microorganismes introduits ou presents dans le lait. La presence des germes dans le lait pasteurise est due a une contamination post-pasteurisation, point critique au niveau des unites de transformation au Burkina Faso. Mots-cles: lait cru, lait pasteurise, composition du lait, bacteries, ferme, laiteries. Milk composition and bacteriological quality of raw and pasteurized milks in Burkina Faso Bacteriological quality and milk components are important tools to check milk quality. The present experiment was carried out from august to September 2012 on four dairy cows and four dairy processing units in Bobo-Dioulasso. Raw milk was collected (30 mL) from cowâ€™s teats in a farm during morning and evening milking at half-way of the milking process and also at the end of whole milking. Furthermore, sixty (60) pasteurized milk boxes were collected from four dairy units. Milk composition was determined by infrared method using Farm Milk Analyser (Miris, AB Sweden, 2001) and milk pH using pH-meter. The somatic cells count was done using fluorescence method (Delaval Cell Counter, Tumba, Sweden). Farm milk analyser was calibrated for processing milk. The gelose Baird Parker and gelose Lactis of Cristal Violet and Neutral Red were used to grow Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, respectively. The plate count agar was also used to grow the total bacteria. The data were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA) using Minitab 15. The results showed that proteins and lactose contents in milk pasteurized were different between dairy units (p Ë‚ 0.05). The average of total bacteria count was 116*10 3 ufc/mL in the raw milk of farm and 18*10 3 ufc/mL in the pasteurized milk of dairy unit. Total bacteria count (10 6 ufc/mL) of raw milk was higher in farmer milking routine conditions than raw milk collected in experimental conditions (10 5 ufc/mL). Total bacteria count was lower in pasteurized milk (10 4 ufc/mL) than in raw milk. Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were found in pasteurized milk. In conclusion, good hygiene practices contribute to reduce the milk contamination on farm. The pasteurization process must help to eliminate all pathogens during processing. However, the presence of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli in pasteurized milk was the post-contamination during packaging which is a critical control point at dairy processing level in Burkina Faso.

Epidemiology of HIV infection in urban Burkina Faso,"We conducted a cross-sectional study of sexually transmitted disease and HIV infections among a random sample of the 2364 adult population in 2000 in Bobo-Dioulasso, the second largest town in Burkina Faso. The prevalence of HIV infection was 5.2%. Risk factor analysis was conducted among sexually active men 20 to 34 years old and women 15 to 24 years old. Factors independently associated with HIV infection among men were having been married (adjusted odds ratio (aOR)=8.19 [1.70-39]), reporting more than two non-marital partners in the last 12 months (aOR=6.07 [1.14-32.4]), reporting a past urban residence other than Bobo-Dioulasso (aOR =6.37 [1.96-20.7] and having a positive serology for HSV-2 infection (aOR=12.0 [3.49-40.9]). Among women the factors were being Christian (aOR=3.73 [1.20-11.6]), having had a first sexual partner more than 24 years old (aOR =4.30 [1.35-13.6]) and having a positive serology for HSV-2 infection (aOR =4.40 [1.32-14.6]). HIV infection in Bobo-Dioulasso therefore depends on both exposure factors (sexual behaviours) and transmissibility cofactors (HSV-2).",2004,International Journal of STD & AIDS
Multilevel Survival Analysis with Structured Penalties for Imaging Genetics data,"Predicting the future occurrence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a topic of active research. Many papers have formulated this question as a classification problem: one considers a fixed time of conversion and aims to discriminate between the patients who have converted to AD at that time and those who have not. However, a clinically more relevant question is to predict the date at which a patient to AD. Survival analysis is an adequate statistical framework for such a task. Multimodal data (imaging and genetic) provide complementary information for the prediction. While imaging data provides an estimate of the current patient's state, genetic variants can be associated to the speed of progression to AD. Although they do not provide the same type of information, most papers in classification or regression put imaging and genetic variables on the same level in order to predict the current or future patient's state. In this work, we propose a survival model using multimodal data to estimate the conversion date to AD, by considering joint effects between the imaging and genetic modalities. We introduce an adapted penalty in the survival model, the group lasso penalty, over joint groups of genes and brain regions. The model is evaluated on genetic (single nucleotide polymorphisms) and imaging (anatomical MRI measures) data from the ADNI database, and compared to a standard Cox model.",2020,
Encounters with the â€hiddenâ€ world: Occult materialism in Gothic childrenâ€™s fiction,"The recent â€speculativeâ€ turn in philosophy â€“ taken by writers such as Quentin Meillassoux (After Finitude, 2008), Graham Harman (Weird Realism, 2012), and Eugene Thacker (Horror of Philosophy, 2015) â€“ attempts to account for objects, matter and other aspects of reality outside their relations with the human. This is not a return to naÃ¯ve realism, but an endeavour to move beyond the limitations of deconstructive turns of Western thought, theorise encounters with materiality and develop new theories of ontology. Speculative materialism frequently turns to the Gothic for analogies or correlates. Graham Harman uses, for example, the stories of H.P. Lovecraft, whilst Eugene Thacker reads supernatural fiction to reveal â€the horror of philosophyâ€.",2018,
Education among orphans and non-orphans in an urban area of Burkina Faso,"Abstract Africa has long dealt with issues surrounding orphanhood and the fostering of children whose parents are no longer alive or available. With the increasing impact of HIV reflected demographically throughout the world, the sociodemographic situation of orphans in sub-Saharan Africa has only grown in visibility and importance. This paper compares orphans and non-orphans living in an urban area of Burkina Faso (Bobo-Dioulasso), with a special focus on school enrolment and delay. We found in univariate analysis that orphans and nonâ€orphans are equally likely to be enrolled in school, but orphans are more likely to be delayed. Once controlling for sociodemographic differences, however, orphans are not delayed significantly in school when compared with non-orphans. Results suggest that, while orphans may be at educational risk due to other concomitant sociodemographic factors, in this urban area orphan status alone does not significantly predict educational enrolment and short-term outcome.",2008,Vulnerable Children and Youth Studies

Comparison of penalty functions for sparse canonical correlation analysis,"Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is a widely used multivariate method for assessing the association between two sets of variables. However, when the number of variables far exceeds the number of subjects, such in the case of large-scale genomic studies, the traditional CCA method is not appropriate. In addition, when the variables are highly correlated the sample covariance matrices become unstable or undefined. To overcome these two issues, sparse canonical correlation analysis (SCCA) for multiple data sets has been proposed using a Lasso type of penalty. However, these methods do not have direct control over sparsity of solution. An additional step that uses Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) has also been suggested to further filter out unimportant features. In this paper, a comparison of four penalty functions (Lasso, Elastic-net, SCAD and Hard-threshold) for SCCA with and without the BIC filtering step have been carried out using both real and simulated genotypic and mRNA expression data. This study indicates that the SCAD penalty with BIC filter would be a preferable penalty function for application of SCCA to genomic data.",2012,Computational statistics & data analysis
Application of artificial neural networks to wave load prediction for coastal bridges,"Predicting quickly and accurately the wave forces on the bridge superstructures from wave height and bridge structure information is important in facilitating bridge design and estimating potential damages to coastal bridges by hurricanes and tsunamis for disaster management. This study proposes a machine learning approach with Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) as an alternative and competitive method for wave force prediction in contrast to the conventional approaches of laboratory tests and numerical simulations which are often expensive and time consuming. At first, we exploit the available Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation models/software to generate the ""ground-truth"" data for ANN training. A comparison study among eight linear and nonlinear regression models including ANN and Support Vector Regression and LASSO shows that ANN outperforms all other models in terms of prediction accuracy. Various tuning experiments have been carried out in selecting an optimal network structure. We also studied the effect of input data standardization and our results indicate that input data standardization is beneficial to improve the prediction performance of ANN. Finally, the trained network structures are successfully evaluated with appreciable correlation coefficients and small root mean square errors. The results show that the proposed ANN approach is robust and capable of capturing the physical complexities for the wave force on deck prediction task.",2017,

High dimensional data regression using Lasso model and neural networks with random weights,"This paper aims to develop a framework for high dimensional data regression, where the model interpretation and prediction accuracy are regularized. Taking application background into account, we supposed that the collected samples for building learner models are expensive and limited. Our technical contributions include the generation of ensemble features (EF) using Lasso models with some selective regularizing factors estimated via a cross-validation procedure; and predictive model building using neural networks with random weights, where the weights and biases of the hidden nodes are assigned randomly in a specific interval, and the output weights are evaluated analytically by a regularized least square method. Experiments with comparisons on estimating protein content of milk from its NMR spectrum are carried out by a data set with 31,570 dimensions (spectrum size) and 120 samples. Results demonstrate that our proposed solution for data regression problems with small samples and high dimensionality is promising, and the learning system performs robustly with respect to a key parameter setting in the ensemble feature generation.",2016,Inf.

Techniques for omental retraction during laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication,"A laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication is more difficult in patients with excessive omental fat, particularly when the surgeon attempts to ligate the short gastric vessels, mobilizing the greater curvature of the stomach and exposing the left diaphragmatic crura. Most surgeons place the patient in steep reverse Trendelenberg to allow gravity to pull the omentum out of the operative field. Despite this maneuver, the omentum can still drape over the splenic hilum and left subphrenic space. Another alternative is to place an additional trocar for a hand-held retractor or grasper. However, this procedure is unnecessarily traumatic and can be avoided. There is a method of retracting the omentum during laparascopic Nissen fundoplications that uses readily available laparoscopic instruments and does not require the placement of an additional port. This simple technique for retracting the omentum during a laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication makes use of the Surgitie, a pretied laparoscopic suture, and the Endo Close (United States Surgical Corporation, Norwalk, CT, USA). A Surgitie is placed through one of the ports to lasso the offending piece of omentum along the greater curvature of the stomach. The suture is cut to its fullest length outside the body, then pulled through the trocar and into the abdomen. Gentle traction is placed on the free end of the secured suture with a laparoscopic grasper until the omentum is retracted to an optimal position for visualization. At this point, a 1-mm incision is made in the skin, and the Endo Close is placed through the abdominal wall and into the abdominal cavity. The location of the 1-mm incision should be at a site that will maintain adequate retraction on the omental fat but keep the pretied laparoscopic suture out of the operative field (usually along the left costal margin). The free end of the suture is grasped by the Endo Close and pulled back through the abdominal wall. The suture is secured outside the abdominal cavity by grasping it with a hemostat flush to the skin. More than one Surgitie can be used if needed. After completing the fundoplication, the suture is cut intracorporally near the secured knot and removed. During the past year, we have performed laparoscopic Nissen fundoplications in seven patients with morbid obesity (Body Mass Index >35). The technique we describe has allowed for improved visualization during ligation of the short gastric vessels, mobilization of the greater curvature of the stomach, and exposure of the left diaphragmatic crura. It has also obviated the need for another trocar. This will free up a pair of hands, decrease the amount of instrumentation in an already crowded operative field, and reduce the potential morbidity of using additional retractors and graspers.",1999,Surgical Endoscopy

Diversity and coverage of seagrass ecosystems in south-west Madagascar,"Seagrass meadows provide important nursery and feeding grounds for many commercially valuable fish species. Here, we address the paucity of published information on the status of seagrasses in Madagascar by documenting the results from ecological surveys of 11 seagrass beds in Velondriake, a locally managed marine area (LMMA) in south-west Madagascar. The diversity and coverage of meadows was highest in the north of the LMMA with up to 51% coverage, and lowest in the south (26%). Overall, eight seagrass species were recorded: Cymodocea rotundata, C. serrulata, Halodule uninervis, Halophila ovalis, H. stipulacea, Syringodium isoetifolium, Thalassia hemprichii and Thalassodendron ciliatum. We discuss the natural and anthropogenic factors that may account for the observed low diversity of seagrasses in southern Velondriake, including overfishing, beach-seining, cyclones, siltation and mangrove deforestation. Based on these baseline surveys, as well as discussions with local communities, it is recommended tha...",2013,African Journal of Marine Science
An experimental validation of genomic selection in octoploid strawberry,"The primary goal of genomic selection is to increase genetic gains for complex traits by predicting performance of individuals for which phenotypic data are not available. The objective of this study was to experimentally evaluate the potential of genomic selection in strawberry breeding and to define a strategy for its implementation. Four clonally replicated field trials, two in each of 2 years comprised of a total of 1628 individuals, were established in 2013â€“2014 and 2014â€“2015. Five complex yield and fruit quality traits with moderate to low heritability were assessed in each trial. High-density genotyping was performed with the Affymetrix Axiom IStraw90 single-nucleotide polymorphism array, and 17â€‰479 polymorphic markers were chosen for analysis. Several methods were compared, including Genomic BLUP, Bayes B, Bayes C, Bayesian LASSO Regression, Bayesian Ridge Regression and Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces. Cross-validation within training populations resulted in higher values than for true validations across trials. For true validations, Bayes B gave the highest predictive abilities on average and also the highest selection efficiencies, particularly for yield traits that were the lowest heritability traits. Selection efficiencies using Bayes B for parent selection ranged from 74% for average fruit weight to 34% for early marketable yield. A breeding strategy is proposed in which advanced selection trials are utilized as training populations and in which genomic selection can reduce the breeding cycle from 3 to 2 years for a subset of untested parents based on their predicted genomic breeding values.",2017,Horticulture Research
Generalized ADMM with optimal indefinite proximal term for linearly constrained convex optimization,"We consider the generalized alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for linearly constrained convex optimization. Many problems derived from practical applications have showed that usually one of the subproblems in the generalized ADMM is hard to solve, thus a special proximal term is added. In the literature, the proximal term can be indefinite which plays a vital role in accelerating numerical performance. In this paper, we are devoted to deriving the optimal lower bound of the proximal parameter and result in the generalized ADMM with optimal indefinite proximal term. The global convergence and the \begin{document}$ O(1/t) $\end{document} convergence rate measured by the iteration complexity of the proposed method are proved. Moreover, some preliminary numerical experiments on LASSO and total variation-based denoising problems are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method and the advantage of the optimal lower bound.",2020,Journal of Industrial and Management Optimization
IdentificationofPreferredChemotherapeuticsforCombining with a CHK1 Inhibitor,"Here we report that GNE-783, a novel checkpoint kinase-1 (CHK1) inhibitor, enhances the activity of gemcitabine by disabling the S- and G2cell-cycle checkpoints following DNA damage. Using a focused library of 51 DNA-damaging agents, we undertook a systematic screen using three different cell lines to determine which chemotherapeutics have their activity enhanced when combined with GNE-783. We found that GNE783 was most effective at enhancing activity of antimetabolite-based DNA-damaging agents; however, there wasasurprisinglywiderangeofactivitywithineachclassofagents.We,next,selectedsixdifferenttherapeutic agents and screened these in combination with GNE-783 across a panel of cell lines. This revealed a preference for enhanced chemopotentiation of select agents within tumor types, as, for instance, GNE-783 preferentially enhanced the activity of temozolomide only in melanoma cell lines. Additionally, although p53 mutant status wasimportant for the overallresponse tocombinations with some agents;our data indicate thatthis alone was insufficient to predict synergy. We finally compared the ability of a structurally related CHK1 inhibitor, GNE900, to enhance the in vivo activity of gemcitabine, CPT-11, and temozolomide in xenograft models. GNE-900 significantly enhanced activity of only gemcitabine in vivo, suggesting that strong chemopotentiation in vitro can translate into chemopotentiation in vivo.

Closed-Form Solution and Sparsity Path for Inverse Covariance Estimation Problem,"In this paper, we study the problem of determining a sparsity graph that describes the conditional dependence between different elements of a multivariate random distribution, using a limited number of samples. Graphical Lasso is one of the popular methods for addressing this problem, which imposes a soft penalty in the form of an $l_{1}$ regularization term in its objective function. The first goal of this work is to study the behavior of the optimal solution of Graphical Lasso as a function of its regularization coefficient. We show that if the number of samples is not too small compared to the number of parameters, the sparsity pattern of the optimal solution of Graphical Lasso changes gradually in terms of the regularization coefficient. More precisely, it is proved that each change in the sparsity pattern corresponds to the addition or removal of a single edge of the graph, under generic conditions. It is also shown that Graphical Lasso as a conic optimization problem has a closed-form solution if an acyclic graph is sought. This explicit formula also serves as an approximate solution for non-acyclic sparse graphs. The results are demonstrated on synthetic data and electrical systems.",2018,2018 Annual American Control Conference (ACC)

A varietyof differentshapescanbesimulatedquiteefficiently usingthisapproach (see[3] for a goodoverview), but thecomplexity of theemployed algorithmdoesnâ€™ t allow for interacti ve frameratesin general.

"Thalassobacillus hwangdonensis sp. nov., isolated from a tidal flat sediment.","A Gram-staining-positive, endospore-forming, motile, rod-shaped bacterium, strain AD-1(T), was isolated from a tidal flat sediment of the coast of Hwangdo on the Yellow Sea, Korea. Strain AD-1(T) grew optimally at pH 7.0-7.5 and 40 degrees C and in the presence of 5-10 % (w/v) NaCl. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain AD-1(T) was most closely related to Thalassobacillus devorans G-19.1(T) (98.0 % sequence similarity) and Thalassobacillus cyri HS286(T) (97.8 %). The cell-wall peptidoglycan was based on meso-diaminopimelic acid and MK-7 was the predominant menaquinone. The major polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol and two unidentified lipids. The major fatty acids (>10 % of total fatty acids) were iso-C(15 : 0), iso-C(17 : 0) and anteiso-C(15 : 0). The DNA G+C content of strain AD-1(T) was 45.2 mol%. It appears reasonable to classify strain AD-1(T) as a member of the genus Thalassobacillus. There were differences in fatty acid profiles and phenotypic and genetic characteristics between strain AD-1(T) and the type strains of the two Thalassobacillus species. On the basis of the data presented, strain AD-1(T) represents a novel species within the genus Thalassobacillus, for which the name Thalassobacillus hwangdonensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is AD-1(T) (=KCTC 13254(T) =CCUG 56607(T)).",2010,International journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology
DNA Methylation Biomarkers Predict Objective Responses to PD-1/PD-L1 Inhibition Blockade,"Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment could bring long-lasting clinical benefits to patients with metastatic cancer. However, only a small proportion of patients respond to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade, so predictive biomarkers are needed. Here, based on DNA methylation profiles and the objective response rates (ORRs) of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition therapy, we identified 269 CpG sites and developed an initial CpG-based model by Lasso to predict ORRs. Notably, as measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), our model can produce better performance (AUC = 0.92) than both a model based on tumor mutational burden (TMB) (AUC = 0.77) and a previously reported TMB model (AUC = 0.71). In addition, most CpGs also have additional synergies with TMB, which can achieve a higher prediction accuracy when joined with TMB. Furthermore, we identified CpGs that are associated with TMB at the individual level. DNA methylation modules defined by protein networks, Kyoto Encylopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, and ligand-receptor gene pairs are also associated with ORRs. This method suggested novel immuno-oncology targets that might be beneficial when combined with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. Thus, DNA methylation studies might hold great potential for individualized PD1/PD-L1 blockade or combinatory therapy.",2019,Frontiers in Genetics
Variable Selection in Restricted Linear Regression Models,"The use of prior information in the linear regression is well known to provide more efficient estimators of regression coefficients. The methods of non-stochastic restricted regression estimation proposed by Theil and Goldberger (1961) are preferred when prior information is available. In this study, we will consider parameter estimation and the variable selection in non-stochastic restricted linear regression model, using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method introduced by Tibshirani (1996). A small simulation study and real data example are provided to illustrate the performance of the proposed method for dealing with the variable selection and the parameter estimation in restricted linear regression models.",2017,arXiv: Applications
Penalized Linear Unbiased Selection,"We introduce MC+, a fast, continuous, nearly unbiased, and accurate method of penalized variable selection in high-dimensional linear regression. The LASSO is fast and continuous, but biased. The bias of the LASSO interferes with variable selection. Subset selection is unbiased but computationally costly. The MC+ has two elements: a minimax concave penalty (MCP) and a penalized linear unbiased selection (PLUS) algorithm. The MCP provides the minimum non-convexity of the penalized loss given the level of bias. The PLUS computes multiple local minimizers of a possibly non-convex penalized loss function in certain main branch of the graph of such solutions. Its output is a continuous piecewise linear path encompassing from the origin to an optimal solution for zero penalty. We prove that for a universal penalty level, the MC+ has high probability of correct selection under much weaker conditions compared with existing results for the LASSO for large n and p, including the case of p â‰« n. We provide estimates of the noise level for proper choice of the penalty level. We choose the sparsest solution within the PLUS path for a given penalty level. We derive degrees of freedom and Cp-type risk estimates for general penalized LSE, including the LASSO estimator, and prove their unbiasedness. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the continuity of the penalized LSE under general sub-square penalties. Simulation results overwhelmingly support our claim of superior variable selection properties and demonstrate the computational efficiency of the proposed method.",2007,
Hepatitis-A-Infektionen durch Lebensmittel,"ZusammenfassungDas Hepatitis-A-Virus ist fÃ¼r etwa ein Drittel aller in Deutschland auftretenden FÃ¤lle von akuter Virushepatitis verantwortlich. Die Infektion wird in der Regel fÃ¤kal-oral Ã¼bertragen, wobei der hÃ¤ufigste Ãœbertragungsweg der enge Kontakt mit einem Infizierten sein dÃ¼rfte. Nur bei einem kleinen Teil der Infektionen lÃ¤sst sich eine Ãœbertragung durch kontaminierte Lebensmittel belegen; allerdings muss man hier von einer hohen Dunkelziffer ausgehen. BegÃ¼nstigt wird eine Ãœbertragung Ã¼ber Lebensmittel durch die auÃŸerordentliche StabilitÃ¤t des Erregers, die hohe Viruskonzentration im Stuhl infizierter Personen und die Tatsache, dass die Hauptausscheidung des Erregers in der spÃ¤ten Inkubationsphase stattfindet, also zu einem Zeitpunkt, zu dem der Betroffene noch nichts von seiner Infektion weiÃŸ. Drei verschiedene Ãœbertragungsmuster lassen sich fÃ¼r lebensmittelassoziierte Hepatitis-A-Infektionen feststellen: die Ãœbertragung durch nicht oder ungenÃ¼gend gekochte Muscheln, die aus fÃ¤kal verunreinigten GewÃ¤ssern stammen, die Ãœbertragung durch tiefgefrorenes Obst oder GemÃ¼se, das bei der Ernte oder der Verpackung kontaminiert wurde, und schlieÃŸlich die Ãœbertragung durch Speisen, die von Infizierten zubereitet wurden. Durch strikte Einhaltung grundlegender HygienemaÃŸnahmen lieÃŸe sich ein groÃŸer Teil dieser Infektionen vermeiden. Da Hepatitis-A-Infektionen oft auf Reisen in Gegenden mit suboptimalen hygienischen Bedingungen erworben werden, kommt der vorbeugenden Impfung eine herausragende Bedeutung zu.AbstractThe Hepatitis A virus causes about one third of all acute cases of viral hepatitis in Germany. The virus is usually transmitted via the fecal oral route, in most cases by close contact with an infected individual. Only a small percentage of cases is recorded as food-borne; however a high number of unrecognized food-borne infections has to be assumed. Transmission by food is favoured by the extraordinary stability of the virus, by high viral concentrations in the stool of infected individuals, and by the fact that the amount of excreted virus is highest in the late incubation phase, i.e. before a person is aware of his or her infection. Three main modes of transmission are known for food-borne hepatitis A: transmission by raw or insufficiently heated shellfish growing in fecally contaminated water, transmission by frozen fruits or vegetable contaminated while being harvested or packed, and transmission by food prepared by an infected individual. Many of these infections could be prevented by strict adherence to basic hygienic measures. As food-borne hepatitis A infections are often acquired during travelling in countries with suboptimal hygienic conditions vaccinating travellers against hepatitis A is of special importance for preventing infections.",2002,Bundesgesundheitsblatt - Gesundheitsforschung - Gesundheitsschutz
Regularizing Structural Equation Models via the Lasso : Generalizability and Reproducibility Issues,"Generalizability and Reproducibility of research have become one of the main topics in current psychology. Previous discussions on the issue have focused on the â€˜Experimental/Proceduralâ€™ aspect such as incentive structure for researchers, violation in conducting an experiment, selective reporting, etc. However, sometimes statistical methods which are widely used in psychology have properties that undermine the generalizabilty of research results. The present thesis approaches the reproducibility problem based on this â€˜Analytical/Statisticalâ€™ aspect. For this purpose, we studied a method for improving the â€˜Structural Equation Modeling(SEM)â€™, one of dominant statistical models in psychology. The main focus of this study is implementingL1-regularization, or â€˜Lassoâ€™, to SEM. With this method, the result will enjoy less variability of estimation than the existing Maximum Likelihood method. First of all, the present thesis discusses some indices including â€˜Overall Discrepancy(OD)â€™ and â€˜Mean Squared Error(MSE)â€™ as criteria which indicate the generalizability and reproducibility of analysis results. Bayesian Lasso SEM, one of the previous attempts, is also covered with some fundamental issues. Furthermore, an algorithm for regularizing SEM via the Lasso is derived and examined by several simulation studies. The study is carried out using Factor Analysis Model and Structural Equation Modeling, while adding several misspecified parameters.

Trait-specific selective mortality has been documented in the laboratory and field, yet our knowledge of the factors contributing to the existence, strength, and consistency of natural selective mortality is limited. We compiled previously published and unpublished data on the common Caribbean coral reef fish, Thalassoma bifasciatum, recruiting to Barbados, West Indies, and the upper Florida Keys to examine how environmental variability during pelagic larval life influences the distribution of early life-history traits exhibited by new recruits. We explored how the scope of variability in otolith-derived traits such as larval growth, pelagic larval duration (PLD), size and condition at settlement, and early juvenile growth influences the degree to which mortality of juveniles is selective. At both locations, contrasting oceanographic conditions (periodic passage of large low-salinity North Brazil Current [NBC] rings near Barbados and seasonal variation in water temperature at Florida) led to significant differences in the early life-history traits of recruits. Mortality was most frequently selective for the two most variable traits, condition at settlement and early juvenile growth. Environmental variability (including variation in predation pressure and stress-inducing conditions) also likely influences juvenile mortality and consequently the degree to which selective loss of particular traits occurs. As we begin to better understand the spatial, temporal, and species-specific circumstances in which events occurring during larval life influence juvenile performance, studies must also be extended to examine how these processes are translated into adult fitness.",2006,Integrative and comparative biology
[Sociocultural aspects of epilepsy in secondary school students in Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina Faso)].,"In Black Africa, epilepsy is usually affected by sociocultural attitudes. A school survey concerning epilepsy was conducted in February 1999 in Bobo-Dioulasso, an Islamic region. Knowledge and attitudes towards epilepsy in secondary school students was evaluated through focus group discussions done in secondary schools. Epilepsy was supposed to be a chronic disease attributed to brain damage, or spiritual. The students usually described the ""Grand Mal"" generalized tonic-clonic form of epilepsy. Epilepsy is believed to have hereditary causes and the students believed it to be contagious through saliva and physical contact. For students, epilepsy cannot be cured. When a treatment was proposed, only traditional medicine was supposed to be competent. If burns occur in the course of the disease, the prognosis is supposed to be bad. Generally fear and mistrust are dominant feelings among students despite the fact they are literate urban population. Their belief in the contagiousness of epilepsy could be a major reason for discriminating against an epileptic person. Our data suggest that there is a need to make additional efforts in order to increase the knowledge of the general population and the level of formal education. Poor knowledge and lack of information explained secondary school students attitudes towards epilepsy in Bobo-Dioulasso.",2002,Revue neurologique
Weighted covariance matching based square root LASSO,"We propose a method for high dimensional sparse estimation in the multiple measurement vector case. The method is based on the covariance matching technique and with a sparse penalty along the ideas of the square-root LASSO (sr-LASSO). The method not only benefits from the strong characteristics of sr-LASSO (independence of the hyper-parameter selection from the noise variance), but also offers a performance near maximum likelihood. It performs close to the Cramer-Rao bound even at low signal to noise ratios and it is generalized to manage correlated noise. The only assumption in this matter is that the noise covariance matrix structure is known. The numerical simulation provided in an array processing application illustrates the potential of the method.",2015,"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)"

The Thalassocentric Apparatus: Connected art processes from the sea showing multi-scale changes through their own emergence and collapse,"The sea changes in many ways and on many levels. These changes are complex and highly connected and as a result are hard to predict Connected, changing systems of different scale are found in many areas of life. As well as physical systems such as the sea, they are apparent in emerging and collapsing ecological systems (Gunderson, Holling 2002), in systems of human ideas such as the philosophy of Deleuze and Guattari and, as I argue, in arts practice. 
 
Although attempts to know the sea are inherently difficult, they also offer opportunities. For example, if we were better able to perceive the changes of the sea, we might better approach other pressing problems that categorise our current age, such as climate change and the threat of collapse within other socio-ecological systems. A sea-centred form of ecological thinking could promote awareness of change and connection on different scales in varied realms. 
 
I demonstrate how forms of change, initially familiar through the movements of the sea, can be understood through arts practice. I refer to this sea-centred, ecological perception as â€˜thalassocentric', (from the Greek thalassa, sea). This term denotes an outlook that (in some way) originates within the sea, even if it then addresses land, social arrangements or human imagination. Although thalassocentric understanding is derived from the movement of waves, I show that the concept can be developed as a useful tool for understanding changes beyond the oceans. 
 
Having analysed a number of key creative practices that engage with the contexts described, I develop an arts-centred use of the term 'apparatus'. I show that art apparatuses can be considered to move and change in ways that are also thalassocentric. This model is tested and applied through a series of creative projects which suggest that changes within art apparatuses can help us understand changes elsewhere. It therefore offers a valuable model that can contribute to our knowledge and understanding of other complex systems.",2015,
Automatic Extraction of Behavioral Patterns for Elderly Mobility and Daily Routine Analysis,"The elderly living in smart homes can have their daily movement recorded and analyzed. As different elders can have their own living habits, a methodology that can automatically identify their daily activities and discover their daily routines will be useful for better elderly care and support. In this article, we focus on automatic detection of behavioral patterns from the trajectory data of an individual for activity identification as well as daily routine discovery. The underlying challenges lie in the need to consider longer-range dependency of the sensor triggering events and spatiotemporal variations of the behavioral patterns exhibited by humans. We propose to represent the trajectory data using a behavior-aware flow graph that is a probabilistic finite state automaton with its nodes and edges attributed with some local behavior-aware features. We identify the underlying subflows as the behavioral patterns using the kernel k-means algorithm. Given the identified activities, we propose a novel nominal matrix factorization method under a Bayesian framework with Lasso to extract highly interpretable daily routines. For empirical evaluation, the proposed methodology has been compared with a number of existing methods based on both synthetic and publicly available real smart home datasets with promising results obtained. We also discuss how the proposed unsupervised methodology can be used to support exploratory behavior analysis for elderly care.",2018,ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST)

Zeoliti come precursori di materiali ceramici,"Le zeoliti, inquadrabili fra i solidi microporosi, appartengono alla classe dei tectosilicati. Caratterizzate da una serie di interessanti proprieta (ad esempio scambio ionico, adsorbimento, catalisi), esse rappresentano una categoria di materiali di grande interesse dal punto di vista tecnologico. 
Attenzione e stata rivolta negli ultimi anni alla possibilita di impiegare zeoliti, sia sintetiche che naturali, come materia prima secondaria per lâ€™industria ceramica. Il trattamento termico di zeoliti a temperature sufficientemente elevate permette, infatti, di ottenere, in dipendenza della composizione chimica del sistema iniziale, particolari materiali ceramici. Esso, inoltre, puo rappresentare una valida soluzione al problema dellâ€™inertizzazione di fanghi zeolitici provenienti da operazioni di depurazione di acque reflue. Il trattamento termico porta, infatti, al collasso della struttura zeolitica microporosa e alla successiva formazione di una fase amorfa o cristallina, in grado di intrappolare in modo permanente il catione inquinante, con la possibilita, in questo modo, di ottenere prodotti non necessariamente da â€œdestinareâ€ in discarica, ma valorizzabili come materiali ceramici. 
La ricerca portata avanti nel presente lavoro di dottorato si e sviluppata secondo due linee distinte.
Da un lato, si e studiata la possibilita di produrre materiali ceramici attraverso il trattamento termico di zeoliti sintetiche pre-scambiate con opportuni cationi, o di zeoliti naturali. Si e proceduto, inoltre, alla valutazione delle proprieta fisiche e meccaniche dei manufatti ceramici ottenuti. 
Sono stati studiati, in particolare, due tipi di applicazione delle zeoliti nella fabbricazione di materiali ceramici:
ïƒ¼ produzione di materiali ceramici colorati per trattamento termico della zeolite sintetica A, pre-scambiata con cobalto o cromo, e di due differenti tufi zeolitici, uno a contenuto prevalente di phillipsite, lâ€™altro a contenuto prevalente di clinoptilolite. Si e inoltre valutata la possibilita di utilizzo delle polveri di zeolite sintetica A pre-scambiata con Co2+ o Cr3+ come pigmenti nella composizione di smalti per piastrelle ceramiche;
ïƒ¼ sintesi della celsiana di stronzio, materiale ceramico dotato di buone proprieta termiche ed elettriche, per trattamento termico della zeolite sintetica A pre-scambiata con stronzio.
Dallâ€™altro, si e esaminata la possibilita di trasformare polveri di zeolite sintetica o naturale, provenienti da operazioni di depurazione di acque reflue, in materiali ceramici â€œsicuriâ€ dal punto di vista ambientale, reinserendole cosi, quale risorsa, in un ciclo produttivo. Si e, in particolare, studiato lâ€™impiego di materiali zeolitici nella depurazione di reflui di varia natura e la successiva fase di inertizzazione, per trattamento termico, dei fanghi di risulta, esaminando due casi differenti: 
ïƒ¼ utilizzo di un tufo phillipsitico nel trattamento di reflui modello industriali contenenti cromo;
ïƒ¼ impiego di miscele di zeoliti, una naturale, un tufo phillipsitico, ed una sintetica, la zeolite A, nel trattamento di acque di scarico modello di centrali nucleari, contenenti radionuclidi. 
A valle dei trattamenti termici, accanto alla valutazione delle proprieta fisiche e meccaniche dei manufatti ceramici ottenuti, e stata verificata l'efficacia dell'immobilizzazione dei cationi nocivi con l'ausilio di test di rilascio previsti dalle attuali direttive europee.",2006,

Clinical Use of Interferons: Systemic Administration in Viral Diseases,"Systemic application of interferon to viral infections in humans was most recently reviewed by Billiau and De Somer (1980) and up-to-date accounts of ongoing activities in this area have been provided by Dunnick and Galasso (1979, 1980). Early clinical trials of interferon were discouraging. For instance, a double-blind controlled trial of monkey interferon against common cold virus infections in volunteers showed no evidence of antiviral effect (Scientific Committee on Interferon 1965). However, the doses of interferon used, approximately 104 U per patient, have since been shown to be quite insufficient. A new era in application of interferon began with the development of methods to produce human leukocyte interferon on a large scale. Cantell (1977) pioneered these efforts and much of the leukocyte interferon used in the clinical trials to be discussed here was produced in Helsinki under his direction.",1984,
A simple device for traction of impacted teeth: a technical note.,"Surgical-orthodontic treatment of impacted teeth is a conservative approach that seeks to bring the tooth into occlusal alignment. Currently, surgical exposure of the affected tooth followed by orthodontic treatment for application of eruptive traction is 1 of the most prevalent options for management of impacted teeth, such as incisors and canines. 1 The general principles for successful traction of impacted teeth are based on establishment of radiographic location, creation of the optimal space in the dental arch, surgical exposure of the tooth, attachment of a traction device, and application of orthodontic forces to reposition the tooth into the desired final occlusion. 2 Several methods have been described in the literature for the fixation of traction devices, including lasso wire; drilling of the crown; and bonding of brackets, buttons, or mesh attached to orthodontic wires or chains. Some authors recommend the use of modified brackets to facilitate exposure and bonding to the impacted tooth. 3 Thereby, we propose a simple and effective method for attachment of traction devices that requires only 0.30 mm ligature wire and composite resin for bonding and traction of the impacted tooth.",2012,Journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery : official journal of the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons
"Antiviral Research, at its 30th anniversary, remembrances from its Editor-in-Chief.","The Journal Antiviral Research was conceived and born in 1980, and launched in 1981. We thus celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of the Journal, which, as I will further elaborate upon in this Editorial of the Antivirals Congress at the occasion of â€˜â€˜30 years of Antiviral Researchâ€™â€™, started at a time very few antiviral drugs were around. These were idoxuridine, trifluridine, ribavirin, amantadine, and vidarabine, but, with the discovery of new antiviral agents (to become antiviral drugs later on) such as acyclovir and bromovinyldeoxyuridine, and the cloning of both human interferon-a and -b, â€˜â€˜spring was in the airâ€™â€™, and under the impulse of Huub Schellekens we, Alfons Billiau and I, took on a new initiative, which at the time, may have looked as both daring and adventurous, and perhaps risky as well, as we did not have any previous experience in editing a Journal, and success was not guaranteed. The new Journal may have been regarded as an adventure, in addition to the other duties, research, and teaching, that were linked to our (Alfonsâ€™ and my) job as Professor at the University. Also connected with the journal, at least in the early days, were Rolf Zinkernagel and Harald zur Hausen, who later would win the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. As for any infant growing up, it took 10â€“15 years for the Journal to adolescence and another 10 years to maturation, but with George Galasso, Rich Whitley and Earl R. Kern having acceded to the rank of Editors, the Journal quickly came of age. Thus, time has now come to reflect on the past, cherish the present, and indulge in future perspectives. The Journal has steadily grown to a respected player in the field, worthy of Elsevierâ€™s vested tradition. This meeting (Antivirals Congress) in Amsterdam has been convened by the Publisher, and I was entrusted with the chairmanship, probably because I was the oldest around and associated for the longest time with the Journal. The concept of this Anniversary meeting is different from the annual ICAR (International Conference of Antiviral Research) meetings. In fact, the Journal is by 5 years senior to the ICAR meetings, the first of those (it was not called the first, as we did not know or even anticipate there would be a second one, being held, in 1985, in another Dutch city, Rotterdam. For this Anniversary meeting, an original scientific program was developed, covering as plenary sessions, the following: 1. Setting the scene; 2. Emerging viruses; 3. Virusâ€“host interactions; 4. Drug discovery; 5. Antiviral resistance; 6. New antiviral drugs; 7. Unmet needs; 8. Thirty years of â€˜â€˜Antiviral Researchâ€™â€™; 9. Responses to future challenges.

PISCES trial: the end does not always justify the means.,"TO THE EDITOR: Escudieretalrecentlypublishedanarticledescribing the PISCES (Patient Preference Study of Pazopanib Versus Sunitinib in Advanced or Metastatic Kidney Cancer) trial. The aim of the study was to allow patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) to choose the agent theypreferred, ifprogressiondidnotoccurafterusingpazopanibor sunitinib for 10 weeks each and after (blinded) switching to the other agent for another 10 weeks. We noted that, for the first time, researchers have truly taken into account the patientâ€™s preference for the choice of treatment, which, unfortunately, is unusual in clinical research. This study was rigorously conducted, and we believe that the one thirdofpatientswhowerenotevaluable for thepreferenceanalysisdonot constituteasignificantbiaswithrespecttothestudyâ€™sresults.Theauthorsâ€™ conclusions that, â€œfrom a patientâ€™s perspective, and in the context of comparable efficacy, pazopanib is preferred over sunitinib as first-line treatment for metastatic RCC based on the overall impact of treatmentrelated toxicities and HRQoL [health-related quality of life]â€ are also clear and irrefutable. However, some clinical and perhaps ethical doubts arise in the decision to design a cross-over study that allows nonprogressing patients to switch to the other agent (either pazopanib or sunitinib) after a 10-week period with an oral (multitarget) antivascular endothelial growth factor receptor (anti-VEGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). The authors provideasrationalethecomparableefficacyofsunitinibandpazopanibinthe head-to-head comparison performed in the COMPARZ (Pazopanib VersusSunitinib in theTreatmentofLocallyAdvancedand/orMetastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma) trial. This strategy, on first reflection, seems to be a kind of switch-maintenance treatment with a similar, although slightly different, type of agent, and has no precedent in recent RCC history. Even if the authors declare that the two agents have comparable efficacy, in RCC literature, there are no published studies that compare a preplanned sequence of TKIs with a monotherapy up to progression in stable/respondingpatientswithmetastaticdisease.Retrospectiveevidence has endorsed a discussion regarding which is the best therapeutic sequence in RCC: sorafenib followed by sunitinib and vice versa, or an anti-VEGF TKI followed by a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor versus an anti-VEGF TKI followed by a drug belonging to the same therapeutic class. Some evidence suggests that sorafenib followed by sunitinib, more than the reverse sequence, seems to be the best sequence, at least for a cumulative progression-free survival end point. In this case, the explanation is that sunitinib retains better efficacy as a second-line therapy compared with sorafenib. In the analysis by Iacovelli et al, the sequence of anti-VEGFRâ€“anti-VEGFRâ€“mTOR inhibitor was associated with improved survival compared with the anti-VEGFRâ€“mTOR inhibitorâ€“anti-VEGFR sequence. Therefore, continuing with the same classofagentsseemsbetterthanswitchingtoadifferentclass.Regardlessof how similar they are, different anti-VEGFR drugs, such as axitinib and sorafenib, can perform differently as second-line therapies, as shown in the Axitinib (AG 013736) as Second-Line Therapy for Metastatic Renal Cell Cancer (AXIS) trial. Moreover, data related to pazopanib after sunitinib are scarce, even if a phase II trial has shown that pazopanib retains good activity after previous sunitinib or bevacizumab. GiventhattheprimaryendpointofthePISCEStrialwasthepatientâ€™s preference, it is noteworthy that the response rate or control of the disease wassacrificedintheclinicalevaluationoftheresults.Examplesofdifferent activities of cytotoxic drugs as a function of sequence exist in the oncology literature. For example, in the study by Bonadonna et al, adjuvant cyclophosphamide-methotrexate-fluorouracil followed by doxorubicin was inferior to doxorubicin followed by cyclophosphamidemethotrexate-fluorouracil. The second question is: which agent should be resumed after progression? The use of an anti-VEGFR TKI could give rise to primary or secondary resistance either after sunitinib, pazopanib, or both. So which drug will be the choice for second-line therapy after progression that occurs during receipt of anti-VEGFR TKIs: the drug from period 1, the drug from period 2, or neither drug? In other words, the early use of a second drug, even for just 10 weeks, could hinder its use at the time of progression. In conclusion, we congratulate the authors for their sensitivity to the patientâ€™s preferences, their methodologic novelty, and their courage, but we must pay attention to the therapeutic results and then combine this caution with bravery.",2014,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology
Genome-wide prediction using Bayesian additive regression trees,"BackgroundThe goal of genome-wide prediction (GWP) is to predict phenotypes based on marker genotypes, often obtained through single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chips. The major problem with GWP is high-dimensional data from many thousands of SNPs scored on several thousands of individuals. A large number of methods have been developed for GWP, which are mostly parametric methods that assume statistical linearity and only additive genetic effects. The Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) method was recently proposed and is based on the sum of nonparametric regression trees with the priors being used to regularize the parameters. Each regression tree is based on a recursive binary partitioning of the predictor space that approximates an unknown function, which will automatically model nonlinearities within SNPs (dominance) and interactions between SNPs (epistasis). In this study, we introduced BART and compared its predictive performance with that of the LASSO, Bayesian LASSO (BLASSO), genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP), reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) regression and random forest (RF) methods.ResultsTests on the QTLMAS2010 simulated data, which are mainly based on additive genetic effects, show that cross-validated optimization of BART provides a smaller prediction error than the RF, BLASSO, GBLUP and RKHS methods, and is almost as accurate as the LASSO method. If dominance and epistasis effects are added to the QTLMAS2010 data, the accuracy of BART relative to the other methods was increased. We also showed that BART can produce importance measures on the SNPs through variable inclusion proportions. In evaluations using real data on pigs, the prediction error was smaller with BART than with the other methods.ConclusionsBART was shown to be an accurate method for GWP, in which the regression trees guarantee a very sparse representation of additive and complex non-additive genetic effects. Moreover, the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm with Bayesian back-fitting provides a computationally efficient procedure that is suitable for high-dimensional genomic data.",2016,"Genetics, Selection, Evolution : GSE"
â„“1-Penalized Linear Mixed-Effects Models for BCI,"A recently proposed novel statistical model estimates population effects and individual variability between subgroups simultaneously, by extending Lasso methods. We apply this l1-penalized linear regression mixed-effects model to a large scale real world problem: by exploiting a large set of brain computer interface data we are able to obtain a subject-independent classifier that compares favorably with prior zero-training algorithms. This unifying model inherently compensates shifts in the input space attributed to the individuality of a subject. In particular we are now able to differentiate within-subject and between-subject variability. A deeper understanding both of the underlying statistical and physiological structure of the data is gained.",2011,
Parsimonious sound field synthesis using compressive sampling,"Reproducing a sampled sound field over a two-dimensional area using an array of loudspeakers is a problem with well-appreciated applications to acoustics and ultrasound treatement. Loudspeaker signal design has traditionally relied on a (possibly regularized) least-squares criterion. The fresh look advocated here, permeates benefits from advances in variable selection and compressive sampling by casting the sound field synthesis as a sparse linear regression problem that is solved by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso). Analysis and simulations demonstrate that the novel approach exhibits superb performance even for under-sampled sound fields, where least-squares methods yield inconsistent field reproduction. In addition, Lasso-based synthesis enables judicious placement of parsimonious loudspeaker arrays.",2009,2009 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics
"Factory, Family and Neighbourhood: the Political Economy of Informal Labour in Sheffield","This article explores the experience of formal and informal steel labour in the contexts of the factory, the family, and the neighbourhood in 'Endcliffe', an ex-industrial district of Sheffield, UK. The article reiterates Claude Meillassoux's claim, in his book Maidens, meal and money, that the informal economy is an ideological space for the cheap repro? duction of labour in the interests of capital. Nevertheless, it also examines subjective and ethnographic understandings ofthe meanings of'capital' and 'labour' and ofthe political nature of their shifting boundaries. In Endcliffe, capitalist subcontracting, state welfare, and economic policies of local regeneration have increased the informalization and casualization of steel labour and blurred the social spaces of the factory, the family, and the neighbourhood. The increased permeability between formal and informal economic processes and the re-embeddedness of production in the social and political texture of the neighbourhood tangles idioms of kinship and capitalist ideologies of production and turns the structural conflict between 'capital' and 'labour' into a generational and gender conflict within the working class. The article shows that the 'New Labour' government's attempt to transform Britain into a post-industrial and classless society has paradoxically fostered the re-emergence of ancient modes of production and forms of bonded labour. Endcliffe 'Endcliffe' is an ex-industrial area in the East End of Sheffield, UK.1 The length of Endcliffe Road, which leads up the hill to Endcliffe Cemetery, is punctuated by a hotchpotch of premises, some of which we will return to below: scrap-yards, derelict Victorian shop-floors, Gypsy sites, call centres, boarded-up community centres, electrical shops, the Sheffield Arena, the Bingo centre, Johnny's 'swap shop', the second-hand tool shop, the 'Greek' and Elysium brothels, Khaled's pub, and Milly's 'Black Sparrow'. In the cemetery the gravestones of dead steelworkers turn toward the valley overlooking big steel plants and small workshops dotted along the river Don. Inscribed with sober statements and facing each other in a circle as though for a business meeting, the gravestones of local entrepreneurs and MPs turn towards the street. Described by Marx in 1865 as the outcome ofthe new despotic capi? talism, the many now derelict mills reflected on the surface of the river Don have endured a long history of expansion, nationalizations, rationalizations, and closures before reaching the calm state of desolation in which they may be",2005,Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute
Inactivating hepatitis C virus in donor lungs using light therapies during normothermic ex vivo lung perfusion,"Availability of organs is a limiting factor for lung transplantation, leading to substantial mortality rates on the wait list. Use of organs from donors with transmissible viral infections, such as hepatitis C virus (HCV), would increase organ donation, but these organs are generally not offered for transplantation due to a high risk of transmission. Here, we develop a method for treatment of HCV-infected human donor lungs that prevents HCV transmission. Physical viral clearance in combination with germicidal light-based therapies during normothermic ex-vivo Lung Perfusion (EVLP), a method for assessment and treatment of injured donor lungs, inactivates HCV virus in a short period of time. Such treatment is shown to be safe using a large animal EVLP-to-lung transplantation model. This strategy of treating viral infection in a donor organ during preservation could significantly increase the availability of organs for transplantation and encourages further clinical development.Organs from donors with transmissible viral infections, such as hepatitis C virus (HCV), are not offered for transplantation due to a high risk of transmission.

LASSO-based Cox-PH model identifies an 11-lncRNA signature for prognosis prediction in gastric cancer,"The present study aimed to identify a long nonâ€‘coding (lnc) RNAsâ€‘based signature for prognosis assessment in gastric cancer (GC) patients. By integrating gene expression data of GC and normal samples from the National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus, the EBI ArrayExpress and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) repositories, the common RNAs in Genomic Spatial Event (GSE) 65801, GSE29998, Eâ€‘MTABâ€‘1338, and TCGA set were screened and used to construct a weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) network for mining GCâ€‘related modules. Consensus differentially expressed RNAs (DERs) between GC and normal samples in the four datasets were screened using the MetaDE method. From the overlapped lncRNAs shared by preserved WGCNA modules and the consensus DERs, an lncRNAs signature was obtained using L1â€‘penalized (lasso) Coxâ€‘proportional hazard (PH) model. LncRNAâ€‘mRNA networks were constructed for these signature lncRNAs, followed by functional annotation. A total of 14,824 common mRNAs and 2,869 common lncRNAs were identified in the 4Â sets and 5 GCâ€‘associated WGCNA modules were preserved across all sets. MetaDE method identified 1,121 consensus DERs. A total of 50 lncRNAs were shared by preserved WGCNA modules and the consensus DERs. Subsequently, an 11â€‘lncRNA signature was identified by LASSOâ€‘based Coxâ€‘PH model. The lncRNAs signatureâ€‘based risk score could divide patients into 2 risk groups with significantly different overall survival and recurrenceâ€‘free survival times. The predictive capability of this signature was verified in an independent set.

Life in High-Salinity Environments,"A great variety of hypersaline environments exist, here defined as environments with salt concentrations exceeding seawater salinity. These include natural inland salt lakes such as Great Salt Lake, Utah, and the Dead Sea, alkaline soda lakes with salt concentrations often close to saturation, and man-made saltern ponds for the production of salt from seawater. There are thalassohaline (seawater-derived) and athalassohaline brines with ionic compositions very different from that of seawater. High salt environments are inhabited by diverse halophilic and/or halotolerant microorganisms belonging to all three domains of life: Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya. Many halophilic microorganisms are 'polyextremophiles', able to thrive in environments stressed not only by high salt concentrations but also by extremes of pH, temperature, or both. There are two different strategies that enable microorganisms to live at high salt: some maintain a low-salt cytoplasm and produce organic 'compatible' solutes to provide osmotic balance, while others accumulate molar concentration of KCl intracellularly. Not all physiological types of microorganisms are found up to the highest salinities, and this is probably due to the high energetic cost of osmotic adaptation. At the highest salinities most aerobic heterotrophic activity is due to Archaea of the family Halobacteriaceae, but extremely halophilic Bacteria also exist. The microbial communities inhabiting high salt environments can be studied by culture-dependent and by molecular, culture-independent techniques. Different groups of halophiles have characteristic lipids and pigments, and these can be used as biomarkers for the qualitative and quantitative characterization of the biota of salt lakes, saltern ponds and other hypersaline environments.",2016,

Evaluation of Simultaneous Effect of Lovastatin Plus Fluoxetine on Depression Using Linear Mixed Model with LASSO Penalty.,"The effect of lovastatin plus fluoxetine on depression has been investigated in many studies, but ignoring other effective factors has decreased the accuracy of the results. The aim of this study was to assess the simultaneous effect of lovastatin plus fluoxetine on depression while controlling a large number of potential covariates using penalized linear mixed model in a longitudinal study. 60 patients with major depressive disorder according to DSM-IV diagnostic criteria were enrolled. The sample was randomly allocated into fluoxetine (up to 40 mg/day) plus lovastatin (30 mg/day) group and fluoxetine (up to 40 mg/day) plus placebo group. Hamilton depression rating scale was used to measure the depression score at baseline, week 2, and week 6. We used linear mixed model (LMM) with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) penalty. Among 60 patients, 39 (65%) were female with a mean age of 31.93 (9.8) years; 51.7% of the patients were married, a majority (73%) lived in village, and 45% of them had high school education. Both groups showed a significant decrease in depression score using Hamilton Depression scale. However, depression score in the treatment group decreased more than the placebo group (Mean=12.8(SD=6.3) vs. Mean=8.2(SD=4.0), t=3.4, P<.001).The proposed model revealed that in the presence of the other covariates, lovastatin plus fluoxetine could play a key role in the reduction of depression. It was also shown that all of the covariates except blood pressure had a significant effect on depression. Linear mixed model with LASSO penalty revealed that sex, age, education, physical illness had the most significant effect on depression.results demonstrated that the masters' students were possessed of less spiritual growth, indicating the need for more accurate planning towards improving students' health-promoting lifestyles.

"The Oligochaeta (Annelida, Clitellata) of the St. Lawrence Great Lakes Region: an Update","An updated oligochaete species list for the Great Lakes region is provided. The list was developed through the reexamination of the taxa reported in a previous report in 1980, addition of new taxa or records collected from the region since 1980, and an update of taxonomy commensurate with systematic and nomenclatural changes over the intervening years since the last review. The authors found 74 papers mentioning Great Lakes oligochaete species. The majority of these papers were published in the 1980s. The literature review and additional collections resulted in 15 species being added to the previous list. Nine taxa were removed from the previous list due to misidentification, synonymies, level of identification, or inability to confirm the identity. Based on this review, 101 species of Oligochaeta are now known from the St. Lawrence Great Lakes watershed. Of these, 95 species are known from the St. Lawrence Great Lakes proper, with an additional 6 species recorded from the inland waters of the watershed. The greatest diversity of oligochaete species was found in the inland waters of the region (81) followed by Lake Huron (72), Lake Ontario (65), Lake Erie (64), Lake Superior (63), Lake Michigan (62), St. Marys River (60), Niagara River (49), Saginaw Bay (44), St. Clair River (37), Lake St. Clair (36), St. Lawrence River (27), and the Detroit River (21). Three species are suspected of being introduced, Branchiura sowerbyi, Gianius aquaedulcis and Ripistes parasita, and two are believed to be endemic, Thalassodrilus hallae and Teneridrilus flexus.",2003,Journal of Great Lakes Research
Learning algorithms for sparse classification,"This thesis deals with the development of estimation algorithms with embedded feature selection the context of high dimensional data, in the supervised and unsupervised frameworks. The contributions of this work are materialized by two algorithms, GLOSS for the supervised domain and Mix-GLOSS for unsupervised counterpart. Both algorithms are based on the resolution of optimal scoring regression regularized with a quadratic formulation of the group-Lasso penalty which encourages the removal of uninformative features. The theoretical foundations that prove that a group-Lasso penalized optimal scoring regression can be used to solve a linear discriminant analysis bave been firstly developed in this work. The theory that adapts this technique to the unsupervised domain by means of the EM algorithm is not new, but it has never been clearly exposed for a sparsity-inducing penalty. This thesis solidly demonstrates that the utilization of group-Lasso penalized optimal scoring regression inside an EM algorithm is possible. Our algorithms have been tested with real and artificial high dimensional databases with impressive resuits from the point of view of the parsimony without compromising prediction performances.",2013,
Predator density and the functional responses of coral reef fish,"Predation is a key process driving coral reef fish population dynamics, with higher per capita prey mortality rates on reefs with more predators. Reef predators often forage together, and at high densities, they may either cooperate or antagonize one another, thereby causing prey mortality rates to be substantially higher or lower than one would expect if predators did not interact. However, we have a limited mechanistic understanding of how prey mortality rates change with predator densities. We re-analyzed a previously published observational dataset to investigate how the foraging response of the coney grouper (Cephalopholis fulva) feeding on the bluehead wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum) changed with shifts in predator and prey densities. Using a model-selection approach, we found that per-predator feeding rates were most consistent with a functional response that declines as predator density increases, suggesting either antagonistic interactions among predators or a shared antipredator behavioral response by the prey. Our findings suggest that variation in predator density (natural or anthropogenic) may have substantial consequences for coral reef fish population dynamics.",2013,Coral Reefs
A Noise-Robust Fast Sparse Bayesian Learning Model,"This paper utilizes the hierarchical model structure from the Bayesian Lasso in the Sparse Bayesian Learning process to develop a new type of probabilistic supervised learning approach. This approach has several performance advantages, such as being fast, sparse and especially robust to the variance in random noise. The hierarchical model structure in this Bayesian framework is designed in such a way that the priors do not only penalize the unnecessary complexity of the model but also depend on the variance of the random noise in the data. The hyperparameters in the model are estimated by the Fast Marginal Likelihood Maximization algorithm and can achieve low computational cost and faster learning process. We compare our methodology with two other popular Sparse Bayesian Learning models: The Relevance Vector Machine and a sparse Bayesian model that has been used for signal reconstruction in compressive sensing. We show that our method will generally provide more sparse solutions and be more flexible and stable when data is polluted by high variance noise.",2019,ArXiv
Osteoporosis Recognition in Rats under Low-Power Lens Based on Convexity Optimization Feature Fusion,"Considering the poor medical conditions in some regions of China, this paper attempts to develop a simple and easy way to extract and process the bone features of blurry medical images and improve the diagnosis accuracy of osteoporosis as much as possible. After reviewing the previous studies on osteoporosis, especially those focusing on texture analysis, a convexity optimization model was proposed based on intra-class dispersion, which combines texture features and shape features. Experimental results show that the proposed model boasts a larger application scope than Lasso, a popular feature selection method that only supports generalized linear models. The research findings ensure the accuracy of osteoporosis diagnosis and enjoy good potentials for clinical application.",2019,Scientific Reports
HIV and Malaria Co infection in the Department of Paediatrics of the University Teaching Hospital Souro Sanou,"Introduction: Malaria and HIV are the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in sub-Saharan Africa. The interaction of these two pathologies raises fundamental as well as therapeutic issues. This study seeks a better understanding of the clinical profile of coinfected biological and therapeutic HIV-Malaria in Children's at Hopital PÃ©diatrique du jour of Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Souro SANOU (CHUSS), Bobo-Dioulasso. Methodology: It is a cross-sectional study with prospective and retrospective aspects. Included, were patients infected with HIV and followed in the department whoâ€™s clinical and laboratory diagnosis of malaria had been performed and/or patients with whom the diagnosis of co-infection was done at the occasion of a medical consultation following the consent of the legal representative. Results: The prevalence of coinfection was 3.09%. The clinical signs of severity were dominated by impaired consciousness, convulsions and dehydration. As for biological signs, anemia was found in 65% of patients; leukocytosis was found in 19.6% of coinfected and thrombocytopenia in 9.3% of cases. HIV-1 was the most encountered stereotype and immunocompetent patients accounted for 70.7% of coinfected. Pharmaco therapeutic groups were mainly administered antimalarial (100% of cases), analgesics-antipyretics (79.6% of cases), ART (48.1% of cases), antibiotics, especially cotrimoxazole (21.3% cases). Conclusion: Immunosuppression induced by HIV infection did not appear to be associated with the frequency of occurrence of malaria. Chemo malaria prophylaxis in children living with HIV is not necessary. Consequently, malaria as a reason for consultation could be a gateway for the recruitment of children infected with HIV.",2015,
Precise performance analysis of the LASSO under matrix uncertainties,"In this paper, we consider the problem of recovering an unknown sparse signal x0 G Rn from noisy linear measurements y = Hx0 +z G Rm. A popular approach is to solve the Â¿4-norm regularized least squares problem which is known as the LASSO. In many practical situations, the measurement matrix H is not perfectely known and we only have a noisy version of it. We assume that the entries of the measurement matrix H and of the noise vector z are iid Gaussian with zero mean and variances 1 /n and Ïƒ2z. In this work, an imperfect measurement matrix is considered under which we precisely characterize the limilting behavior of the mean squared error and the probability of support recovery of the LASSO. The analysis is performed when the problem dimensions grow simultaneously to infinity at fixed rates. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical predictions derived in this paper.",2017,2017 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)
Pelagic distribution and numbers of the Antarctic petrelThalassoica antarctica in the Weddell Sea during spring,"Estimates of the population size of the Antarctic petrelThalassoica antarctica are hampered by its breeding locations in remote nunatak areas of the Antarctic continent. Studies at sea can provide additional information on numbers. Seabird censuses during spring 1992 showed few Antarctic petrels in the western part of the Weddell Sea, but high numbers east of the South Sandwich Islands. The vast majority of the birds occurred in a band of 300 km north to 150 km south of the outer ice edge. Numbers at sea fluctuated in agreement with synchronized colony attendance patterns in the pre-breeding phase and peaked shortly before egglaying when colonies are completely deserted. In this period, densities of Antarctic petrels in the marginal ice zone suggest that at least 2.7Â±0.5 million individuals occur in the Weddell Sea. It is likely that similar numbers occur immediately east of the study area. The distribution of the petrels matches the location, but not the size, of known breeding colonies in Dronning Maud Land and Coats Land, which suggests that important colonies in this area remain to be discovered. The observations imply that Antarctic petrels in the Weddell Sea commute over ice a surprisingly large distance of at least 2,000 km for a single pre-breeding visit to the colonies.",2006,Polar Biology
The Graphical Horseshoe Estimator for Inverse Covariance Matrices,"We develop a new estimator of the inverse covariance matrix for high-dimensional multivariate normal data using the horseshoe prior. The proposed graphical horseshoe estimator has attractive properties compared to other popular estimators, such as the graphical lasso and graphical Smoothly Clipped Absolute Deviation (SCAD). The most prominent benefit is that when the true inverse covariance matrix is sparse, the graphical horseshoe provides estimates with small information divergence from the true sampling distribution. The posterior mean under the graphical horseshoe prior can also be almost unbiased under certain conditions. In addition to these theoretical results, we also provide a full Gibbs sampler for implementing our estimator. MATLAB code is available for download from github at this http URL. The graphical horseshoe estimator compares favorably to existing techniques in simulations and in a human gene network data analysis.",2017,arXiv: Methodology
Robust adaptive Lasso for variable selection,"ABSTRACT The adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) and least absolute deviation (LAD)-Lasso are two attractive shrinkage methods for simultaneous variable selection and regression parameter estimation. While the adaptive Lasso is efficient for small magnitude errors, LAD-Lasso is robust against heavy-tailed errors and severe outliers. In this article, we consider a data-driven convex combination of these two modern procedures to produce a robust adaptive Lasso, which not only enjoys the oracle properties, but synthesizes the advantages of the adaptive Lasso and LAD-Lasso. It fully adapts to different error structures including the infinite variance case and automatically chooses the optimal weight to achieve both robustness and high efficiency. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate a good finite sample performance of the robust adaptive Lasso. Two data sets are analyzed to illustrate the practical use of the procedure.",2017,Communications in Statistics - Theory and Methods
"Christiani Jinming Zhang Mixed Metals exposure , cardiac autonomic responses , inflammation and DNA methylation","Background: welders are often exposed to various types of metals from the welding fumes and they also have high risks of cardiac autonomic dysfunction. Knowing the hazardous components within metals mixture as well as understanding the potential underlying mechanisms is essential for environmental and occupational regulations. Objective: to identify metal components which are associated with cardiac autonomic responses, as measured by two novel markers -acceleration capacity (AC) and deceleration capacity (DC); to examine whether inflammation mediates effects of metals exposure on AC/DC changes; to identify epigenetic variants which are associated with AC/DC changes. Methods: we collected urine, blood and electrocardiogram (ECG) samples from 75 welders over six sampling occasions between June 2003 and June 2012. Urinary concentrations of 16 types of metals were determined. Blood serum samples were analyzed for inflammatory cytokines levels including CRP, IL-2, IL4, IL6 and IL8. AC and DC values were quantified from ECG recordings. Firstly, we used linear mixed-effects models with Lasso to identify hazardous metals that were significantly associated with AC or DC changes. We fitted the copollutants model with â€œselectedâ€ metals in the linear mixed model to estimate the exposure-response relationship. Then, we conducted a mediation analysis to examine whether inflammatory cytokines mediated the effects of metals exposure on AC or DC changes. We report both direct and indirect effects in single pollutant model as well as co-pollutants models. Finally, we conducted the epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) to identify epigenetic variants that were associated with AC or DC changes. Results: we observed negative associations between urinary mercury and chromium concentrations with both DC and AC changes. Indirect effects of metals exposure on AC or DC through inflammation pathway were not significant. We identified GPR133 gene at which methylation level changes were associated with DC values. Conclusion: metals exposures are associated with impaired cardiac",2018,
Predicting Overall Survival in Patients with Metastatic Rectal Cancer: a Machine Learning Approach,"A significant proportion of patients with rectal cancer will present with synchronous metastasis at the time of diagnosis. Overall survival (OS) for these patients are highly variable and previous attempts to build predictive models often have low predictive power, with concordance indexes (c-index) less than 0.70. Using the National Cancer Database (2010â€“2014), we identified patients with synchronous metastatic rectal cancer. The data was split into a training dataset (diagnosis years 2010â€“2012), which was used to build the machine learning model, and a testing dataset (diagnosis years 2013â€“2014), which was used to externally validate the model. A nomogram predicting 3-year OS was created using Cox proportional hazard regression with lasso penalization. Predictors were selected based on clinical significance and availability in NCDB. Performance of the machine learning model was assessed by c-index. A total of 4098 and 3107 patients were used to construct and validate the nomogram, respectively. Internally validated c-indexes at 1, 2, and 3 years were 0.816 (95% CI 0.813â€“0.818), 0.789 (95% CI 0.786â€“0.790), and 0.778 (95% CI 0.775â€“0.780), respectively. External validated c-indexes at 1, 2, and 3 years were 0.811, 0.779, and 0.778, respectively. There is wide variability in the OS for patients with metastatic rectal cancer, making accurate predictions difficult. However, using machine learning techniques, more accurate models can be built. This will aid patients and clinicians in setting expectations and making clinical decisions in this group of challenging patients.",2019,Journal of Gastrointestinal Surgery
"Tree species richness predicted using a spatial environmental model including forest area and frost frequency, eastern USA","Assessing geographic patterns of species richness is essential to develop biological conservation as well as to understand the processes that shape these patterns. We aim to improve geographic prediction of tree species richness (TSR) across eastern USA by using: 1) gridded point-sample data rather than spatially generalized range maps for the TSR outcome variable, 2) new predictor variables (forest area FA; mean frost day frequency MFDF) and 3) regression models that account for spatial autocorrelation. TSR was estimated in 50 km by 50 km grids using Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) point-sample data. Eighteen environmental predictor variables were employed, with the most effective set selected by a LASSO that reduced multicollinearity. Those predictors were then employed in Generalized linear models (GLMs), and in Eigenvector spatial filtering (ESF) models that accounted for spatial autocorrelation. Models were evaluated by model fit statistics, spatial patterns of TSR predictions, and spatial autocorrelation. Our results showed gridded TSR was best-predicted by the ESF model that used, in descending order of influence: precipitation seasonality, mean precipitation in the driest quarter, FA, and MFDF. ESF models, by accounting for spatial autocorrelation, outperformed GLMs regardless of the predictors employed, as indicated by percent deviance explained and spatial autocorrelation of residuals. Small regions with low TSR, such as the Midwest prairie peninsula, were successfully predicted by ESF models, but not by GLMs or other studies. Gridded TSR in Florida was only correctly predicted by the ESF model with FA and MFDF, and was over-predicted by all other models.",2018,PLoS ONE

Predicting Profile Soil Properties with Reflectance Spectra via Bayesian Covariate-Assisted External Parameter Orthogonalization,"In situ, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) profile soil sensors have the potential to provide both rapid and high-resolution prediction of multiple soil properties for precision agriculture, soil health assessment, and other applications related to environmental protection and agronomic sustainability. However, the effects of soil moisture, other environmental factors, and artefacts of the in-field spectral data collection process often hamper the utility of in situ DRS data. Various processing and modeling techniques have been developed to overcome these challenges, including external parameter orthogonalization (EPO) transformation of the spectra. In addition, Bayesian modeling approaches may improve prediction over traditional partial least squares (PLS) regression. The objectives of this study were to predict soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), and texture fractions using a large, regional dataset of in situ profile DRS spectra and compare the performance of (1) traditional PLS analysis, (2) PLS on EPO-transformed spectra (PLS-EPO), (3) PLS-EPO with the Bayesian Lasso (PLS-EPO-BL), and (4) covariate-assisted PLS-EPO-BL models. In this study, soil cores and in situ profile DRS spectrometer scans were obtained to ~1 m depth from 22 fields across Missouri and Indiana, USA. In the laboratory, soil cores were split by horizon, air-dried, and sieved (<2 mm) for a total of 708 samples. Soil properties were measured and DRS spectra were collected on these air-dried soil samples. The data were randomly split into training (n = 308), testing (n = 200), and EPO calibration (n = 200) sets, and soil textural class was used as the categorical covariate in the Bayesian models. Model performance was evaluated using the root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP). For the prediction of soil properties using a model trained on dry spectra and tested on field moist spectra, the PLS-EPO transformation dramatically improved model performance relative to PLS alone, reducing RMSEP by 66% and 53% for SOC and TN, respectively, and by 76%, 91%, and 87% for clay, silt, and sand, respectively. The addition of the Bayesian Lasso further reduced RMSEP by 4â»11% across soil properties, and the categorical covariate reduced RMSEP by another 2â»9%. Overall, this study illustrates the strength of the combination of EPO spectral transformation paired with Bayesian modeling techniques to overcome environmental factors and in-field data collection artefacts when using in situ DRS data, and highlights the potential for in-field DRS spectroscopy as a tool for rapid, high-resolution prediction of soil properties.",2018,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)"
Advanced forecasting methods for renewable generation and loads in modern power systems,"The PhD Thesis deals with the problem of forecasting in power systems, i.e., a wide topic that today covers many and many needs, and that is universally acknowledged to require further deep research efforts. 
After a brief discussion on the classification of forecasting systems and on the methods that are currently available in literature for forecasting electrical variables, stressing pros and cons of each approach, the PhD Thesis provides four contributes to the state of the art on forecasting in power systems where literature is somehow weak. 
The first provided contribute is a Bayesian-based probabilistic method to forecast photovoltaic (PV) power in short-term scenarios. Parameters of the predictive distributions are estimated by means of an exogenous linear regression model and through the Bayesian inference of past observations. 
The second provided contribute is a probabilistic competitive ensemble method once again to forecast PV power in short-term scenarios. The idea is to improve the quality of forecasts obtained through some individual probabilistic predictors, by combining them in a probabilistic competitive approach based on a linear pooling of predictive cumulative density functions. A multi-objective optimization method is proposed in order to guarantee elevate sharpness and reliability characteristics of the predictive distribution. 
The third contribute is aimed to the development of a deterministic industrial load forecasting method suitable in short-term scenarios, at both aggregated and single-load levels, and for both active and reactive powers. The deterministic industrial load forecasting method is based on multiple linear regression and support vector regression models, selected by means of 10-fold cross-validation or lasso analysis.
The fourth contribute provides advanced PDFs for the statistical characterization of Extreme Wind Speeds (EWS). 
In particular, the PDFs proposed in the PhD Thesis are an Inverse Burr distribution and a mixture Inverse Burr â€“ Inverse Weibull distribution. The mixture of an Inverse Burr and an Inverse Weibull distribution allows to increase the versatility of the tool, although increasing the number of parameters to be estimated. This complicates the parameter estimation process, since traditional techniques such as the maximum likelihood estimation suffer from convergence problems.

Application of Feature Selection Method to Error Factor Extraction of Multifunction Peripheral,"Multifunction peripheral (MFP) manufacturers provide customers with remote maintenance services, such as supplies provision and automatic firmware updates, to lower customer burdens and to avoid device downtime. Such remote services are required for maintenance so that Japanese machine manufacturers can deliver products to foreign markets, because service bases in overseas locales must cover broader geographical areas than those in Japan. When MFP devices experience a fault, they generally alert users of an error. Although some faults can be solved remotely, there are faults that require an engineer to perform on-site actions. To repair them on-site efficiently, online investigation and pre-assessment of fault factors will be effective. In this paper, we apply the Group Lasso regularization method for logistic regression to select features determined as error factors. We evaluate the engine on two kinds of error examples: those frequently causing alerts in MFP models in the past, and those causing alerts due to part wear. This engine is expected to help engineers determine causal factors of errors.",2019,2019 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management (IEEM)
Aeroservoelastic Model Validation and Test Data Analysis of the F/A-18 Active Aeroelastic Wing,"ABSTRACTModel validation and ï¬‚ight test data analysis require careful consideration of the effects of uncertainty,noise, and nonlinearity. Uncertainty prevails in the data analysis techniques and results in a compositemodel uncertainty from unmodeled dynamics, assumptions and mechanics of the estimation procedures,noise, and nonlinearity. A fundamental requirement for reliable and robust model development is an at-tempt to account for each of these sources of error, in particular, for model validation, robust stabilityprediction, and ï¬‚ight control system development. This paper is concerned with data processing proce-dures for uncertainty reduction in model validation for stability estimation and nonlinear identiï¬cation.F/A-18Active Aeroelastic Wing (AAW) aircraft data is used to demonstrate signal representationeffects on uncertain model development, stability estimation, and nonlinear identiï¬cation. Data is decom-posed using adaptive orthonormal best-basisand wavelet-basissignal decompositions for signal denoisinginto linear and nonlinear identiï¬cation algorithms. Nonlinear identiï¬cation from a wavelet-basedVolterrakernel procedure is used to extract nonlinear dynamics from aeroelastic responses, and to assist modeldevelopment and uncertainty reduction for model validation and stability prediction by removing a classof nonlinearity from the uncertainty.INTRODUCTIONAeroelastic and aeroservoelastic (ASE) ï¬‚ight data analysis and model validation must necessarily copewith uncertainty, noise, and nonlinearity. Model uncertainty between a high-ï¬delity computational model,reduced-order(ref. [1]) model, or a linear model, and a descriptive representation of the actual aircraftdynamics is inevitable. ASE systems comprise interactions of generally multi-inputmulti-outputsampled-data control feedback with actuation dynamics coupled with ASE. Highly augmented closed-loopï¬‚ighttest data require extra care in distinguishing system component dynamics. Important considerations ofuncertainty classiï¬cation relative to the signal processing and identiï¬cation procedures, versus an actualmodel mis-match,must be assessed and minimized for accurate model updates.Identiï¬cation of ASE dynamics presents one of the greatest challenges for ï¬‚ight data analysis. Un-steady aerodynamics, turbulence, shock effects, and spatially local behaviors are often difï¬cult to quan-tify, especially with inadequate instrumentation. Exogenous inputs and asymmetric characteristics createproblems for observability and identiï¬ability . Model veriï¬cation over an extensiveï¬‚ight envelope presentsmore challenges. Test dataacquisition isexpensivesomaneuversare designed for maximum efï¬cienc y anddata quality with sometimes costly consequences. Veriï¬cation methods are desired which accurately andefï¬ciently include identiï¬cation of critical parameters, address mismodeling and unmodeled dynamics,deal with test condition and system variability, and derive data-consistentparametric and nonparametricuncertainty descriptions (ref. [2, 3]). Non-parametricdescriptions are addressed in this paper.This paper attempts to approach estimation of ASE models with procedures to account for uncertainty,noise, and nonlinearity. Set membership identiï¬cation in the form of bounded error estimation (ref. [2, 4])has been used previously to characterize feasible sets of parameters with uncertainty estimates consistent1",2003,
LASSO order selection for sparse autoregression: a bootstrap approach,"ABSTRACT Autoregressive models are widely employed for predictions and other inferences in many scientific fields. While the determination of their order is in general a difficult and critical step, this task becomes more complicated and crucial when the time series under investigation is realization of a stochastic process characterized by sparsity. In this paper we present a method for order determination of a stationary AR model with a sparse structure, given a set of observations, based upon a bootstrapped version of MAICE procedure [Akaike H. Prediction and entropy. Springer; 1998], in conjunction with a LASSO-type constraining procedure for lag suppression of insignificant lags. Empirical results will be obtained via Monte Carlo simulations. The quality of our method is assessed by comparison with the commonly adopted cross-validation approach and the non bootstrap counterpart of the presented procedure.",2017,Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation
On the Nonnegative Garrote Estimator,"We study the nonnegative garrote estimator from three different aspects: computation, consistency and flexibility. We show that the nonnegative garrote estimate has a piecewise linear solution path. Using this fact, we propose an efficient algorithm for computing the whole solution path for the nonnegative garrote estimate. We also show that the nonnegative garrote has the nice property that with probability tending to one, the solution path contains an estimate that correctly identifies the set of important variables and is consistent for the coefficients of the important variables. Such property is valid for another popular variable selection method, LASSO, only under restrictive conditions. We propose a slight modification that retains the attractive properties of the original nonnegative garrote, but is more widely applicable. To demonstrate the flexibility of the proposed estimator, we consider an extension to the nonparametric regression setup. Simulations and a real example show that the proposed method is very competitive in terms of variable selection and estimation accuracy when compared with other variable selection and estimation methods.",2005,
Alcohol minimum unit pricing and socioeconomic status,"1616 www.thelancet.com Vol 383 May 10, 2014 Floor prices for alcohol, beneath which alcohol cannot be sold, are in place in Moldova, Russia, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, some US states (eg, Connecticut), and eight of the ten Canadian provinces. In 2012, Scotland legislated alcohol minimum unit pricingâ€”a lowest price per unit of alcoholâ€”the introduction of which is pending legal challenge. In the UK, minimum unit pricing is the subject of substantial political and policy debate. UK alcohol prices in the off -trade, particularly supermarkets, have risen more slowly than have taxes on alcohol. Harmful drinkers favour cheap off -trade alcohol, which is targeted by minimum unit pricing. Drinkers on low income also favour cheap alcohol. The UK Government reneged on its plans to introduce a minimum unit price of Â£0Â·45, citing concerns that responsible drinkers on a low income might be disadvantaged. However, the burden of minimum unit pricing on people from lowincome groups would be small, at worst. People from low socioeconomic status backgrounds have fewer resources to protect themselves from the ill eff ects of drinking, and have high levels of alcohol-related mortality and hospital admission at all levels of drinking compared with people from higher socioeconomic status backgrounds. In The Lancet, John Holmes and colleagues report their assessment of the eff ect of the proposed Â£0Â·45 minimum unit price in England as a function of income and socioeconomic status, based on their Sheffi eld Alcohol Policy Model. This model combines an econometric model, which relates changes in the price of alcohol to changes in alcohol consumption, and an epidemiological model, which translates alcohol consumption to mortality and morbidity. In response to the minimum unit price, the study predicts that harmful drinkers in the lowest income quintile would reduce their annual alcohol consumption by 7Â·6% (about 4 weeksâ€™ worth of alcohol) and spend less on alcohol overall, whereas harmful drinkers in the highest quintile would only reduce their consumption by 1%. Responsible drinkers in the lowest quintile would reduce consumption by 1Â·6% and also spend less on alcohol. Public health outcomes were predicted by occupation or socioeconomic status. In Holmes and colleaguesâ€™ study the lowest socioeconomic groups made up about 41% of the population, but were estimated to account for 59% of the alcoholassociated health costs. 10 years after introduction of minimum unit pricing, annual alcohol-related health costs for this group were reduced by 4Â·7%; this reduction accounting for 88% of population-wide savings. The study assumed that retailers would only increase prices to the minimum threshold, providing a conservative estimate of the eff ect of minimum unit pricing. Canadaâ€™s experience is that retailers also increase the price of more expensive forms of alcohol to maintain relative price structures. The Sheffi eld Alcohol Policy Model would ideally be built on a dataset including peopleâ€™s alcohol purchases, consumption, location of purchase, and price. No such dataset exists, so the model links the 2009 General Lifestyle Survey (containing information on mean weekly and highest daily alcohol consumption by beverage types) and the UK Living Costs and Food Survey (containing information on alcoholic beverages Alcohol minimum unit pricing and socioeconomic status 1 Dartnall E, Jewkes R.

Topology reconstruction of complex networks with time-varying parameters nodes,"Complex networks with time-varying parameters nodes are of considerable interest in many areas of science, engineering and nature. Reconstructing networks with unknown but bounded time-varying parameters nodes from limited measured information is desirable and of significant interest for using and controlling these networks. Based on the Lasso method and the Taylor expansion approximation, we develop an efficient, feasible, and completely data-driven approach to predicting the structures of the networks with unknown time-varying parameters nodes in present of noise or without noise. In particular, through the numerical simulations, we demonstrate that, networks structures can be fully reconstructed even only few information available under the conditions of the systemic parameter is time-varying and in the presence of noise, and this method is effective and robust. We expect our method to be useful in addressing issues of significantly current concern in the information era and natural networks.",2017,2017 36th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)

Sexually Transmitted Diseases and Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection among Women with Genital Infections in Burkina Faso,"Summary: This study reports the prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) among gynaecological outpatients presenting at the Bobo-Dioulasso Hospital (Burkina Faso) with genital infections and examines the factors associated with HIV infection in this population. Of 245 eligible non-pregnant women, 220 consented to participate in the study. Seventy-seven per cent had sexually transmitted infections. The most common were: Trichomonas vaginalis (28%), Chlamydia trachomatis (27%), bacterial vaginosis (20%), Candida albicans (17%), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (11%). The prevalence of HIV infection was 42% (95% ci. 35.3, 48.3). Logistic regression analyses revealed Neisseria gonorrhoeae to be the only STD significantly associated with infection with HIV (P = 0.04). A sedimentation rate greater than or equal to 100 mm in the first hour was also associated with HIV infection (P < 0.001). Women consulting for genital infections constitute a high risk group for HIV infection and other STDs. Management of these women should focus on the early diagnosis and treatment of STDs.",1995,International Journal of STD & AIDS
Sparse Linear Models and Two-Stage Estimation in High-Dimensional Settings with Possibly Many Endogenous Regressors,"This paper explores the validity of the two-stage estimation procedure for sparse linear models in high-dimensional settings with possibly many endogenous regressors. In particular, the number of endogenous regressors in the main equation and the instruments in the first-stage equations can grow with and exceed the sample size n. The analysis concerns the exact sparsity case, i.e., the maximum number of non-zero components in the vectors of parameters in the first-stage equations, k1, and the number of non-zero components in the vector of parameters in the second-stage equation, k2, are allowed to grow with n but slowly compared to n. I consider the high-dimensional version of the two-stage least square estimator where one obtains the fitted regressors from the first-stage regression by a least square estimator with l_1-regularization (the Lasso or Dantzig selector) when the first-stage regression concerns a large number of instruments relative to n, and then construct a similar estimator using these fitted regressors in the second-stage regression. The main theoretical results of this paper are non-asymptotic bounds from which I establish sufficient scaling conditions on the sample size for estimation consistency in l_2-norm and variable-selection consistency. A technical issue regarding the so-called ""restricted eigenvalue (RE) condition"" for estimation consistency and the ""mutual incoherence (MI) condition"" for selection consistency arises in the two-stage estimation from allowing the number of regressors in the main equation to exceed n and this paper provides analysis to verify these RE and MI conditions. Depending on the underlying assumptions, the upper bounds on the l_2-error and the sample size required to obtain these consistency results differ by factors involving k1 and/or k2. Simulations are conducted to gain insight on the finite sample performance.",2013,arXiv: Statistics Theory
Machine Learning of Energetic Material Properties,"In this work, we discuss use of machine learning techniques for rapid prediction of detonation properties including explosive energy, detonation velocity, and detonation pressure. Further, analysis is applied to individual molecules in order to explore the contribution of bonding motifs to these properties. Feature descriptors evaluated include Morgan fingerprints, E-state vectors, a custom ""sum over bonds"" descriptor, and coulomb matrices. Algorithms discussed include kernel ridge regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (""LASSO"") regression, Gaussian process regression, and the multi-layer perceptron (a neural network). Effects of regularization, kernel selection, network parameters, and dimensionality reduction are discussed. We determine that even when using a small training set, non-linear regression methods may create models within a useful error tolerance for screening of materials.",2018,arXiv: Materials Science
Abstract 4997: Specialized microRNP and translation mechanisms in quiescent cancer cells,"Quiescence (G0) represents an assortment of reversible, cell cycle-arrested states that are resistant to unfavorable conditions and associated with cancer persistence. G0 involves regulated gene expression with selective mRNA expression and decreased canonical translation. Low mTOR activity in G0 activates the cap complex inhibitor, eIF4EBP, and impairs canonical translation. The alternative translation mechanisms in G0 remain to be uncovered. Our data show that microRNAs, regulatory, non-coding RNAs that target distinct mRNAs to alter gene expression, can associate with alternative complexes and translation factors to regulate specific mRNA translation in G0. One subset of transcripts expressed in G0 includes specific mRNAs recruited by an FXR1a-associated microRNP (microRNA-protein complex) for translation activation in G0 mammalian cells. MicroRNPs predominantly mediate repression and downregulation; however, FXR1a-microRNP lacks conventional microRNP repressors, and instead, contains a specific RNA binding protein isoform, FXR1a. FXR1a promotes translation and is overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis in several cancers. Our data reveal that microRNA-mediated activation requires target mRNAs with unadenylated/ shortened poly(A) tails to avoid the roles of PABP in enhancing microRNA-mediated downregulation and in canonical translation that is impaired in G0. Instead of canonical translation factors that are inhibited by eIF4EBP in G0, we find alternative translation factorsâ€”a non-canonical 5â€™cap binding factor and an eIF4G homolog that interacts with the ribosomeâ€”are recruited by the 3â€™-UTR binding FXR1a-microRNP, and promote specific mRNA translation. Our data show that G0 leukemic cells are chemoresistant and their translation profile is similar to surviving leukemic cells that are isolated after clinical therapy. We find expression of critical cytokines and immune regulators in G0. Significantly, inhibiting these immune regulators in resistant G0 cancer cells reduces their survival and chemoresistance. These data reveal a specialized translation mechanism in G0 cancer cells that promotes specific mRNA translation in these conditions of reduced canonical translation, and is important for chemoresistance.

Optimistic lower bounds for convex regularized least-squares,"Minimax lower bounds are pessimistic in nature: for any given estimator, minimax lower bounds yield the existence of a worst-case target vector $\beta^*_{worst}$ for which the prediction error of the given estimator is bounded from below. However, minimax lower bounds shed no light on the prediction error of the given estimator for target vectors different than $\beta^*_{worst}$. A characterization of the prediction error of any convex regularized least-squares is given. This characterization provide both a lower bound and an upper bound on the prediction error. This produces lower bounds that are applicable for any target vector and not only for a single, worst-case $\beta^*_{worst}$. Finally, these lower and upper bounds on the prediction error are applied to the Lasso is sparse linear regression. We obtain a lower bound involving the compatibility constant for any tuning parameter, matching upper and lower bounds for the universal choice of the tuning parameter, and a lower bound for the Lasso with small tuning parameter.",2017,arXiv: Statistics Theory
Preoperative MRI-radiomics features improve prediction of survival in glioblastoma patients over MGMT methylation status alone,"Background
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant central nervous system tumor, and MGMT promoter hypermethylation in this tumor has been shown to be associated with better prognosis. We evaluated the capacity of radiomics features to add complementary information to MGMT status, to improve the ability to predict prognosis.


Methods
159 patients with untreated GBM were included in this study and divided into training and independent test sets. 286 radiomics features were extracted from the magnetic resonance images acquired prior to any treatments. A least absolute shrinkage selection operator (LASSO) selection followed by Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to determine the prognostic value of radiomics features to predict overall survival (OS). The combination of MGMT status with radiomics was also investigated and all results were validated on the independent test set.


Results
LASSO analysis identified 8 out of the 286 radiomic features to be relevant which were then used for determining association to OS. One feature (edge descriptor) remained significant on the external validation cohort after multiple testing (p=0.04) and the combination with MGMT identified a group of patients with the best prognosis with a survival probability of 0.61 after 43 months (p=0.0005).


Conclusion
Our results suggest that combining radiomics with MGMT is more accurate in stratifying patients into groups of different survival risks when compared to with using these predictors in isolation. We identified two subgroups within patients who have methylated MGMT: one with a similar survival to unmethylated MGMT patients and the other with a significantly longer OS.",2019,Oncotarget
Towards relation discovery for diagnostics,"It is difficult to implement predictive maintenance in the automotive industry as it looks today, since the sensor capabilities and engineering effort available for diagnostic purposes is limited. It is, in practice, impossible to develop diagnostic algorithms capable of detecting many different kinds of faults that would be applicable to a wide range of vehicle configurations and usage patterns.
 However, it is now becoming feasible to obtain and analyse on-board data on vehicles as they are being used. It makes automatic data-mining methods an attractive alternative, since they are capable of adapting themselves to specific vehicle configurations and usage. In order to be useful, though, such methods need to be able to detect interesting relations between large number of available signal.
 This paper presents an unsupervised method for discovering useful relations between measured signals in a Volvo truck, both during normal operations and when a fault has occurred. The interesting relationships are found in a two-step procedure. In the first step, we identify a set of ""good"" models, by establishing an MSE threshold over the complete data set. In the second step, we estimate model parameters over time, in order to capture the dynamic behaviour of the system. We use two different approaches here, the LASSO method and the Recursive Least Squares filter. The usefulness of obtained relations is then evaluated using supervised learning to separate different classes of faults.",2011,
Eurasianism: an ideology for the multipolar world,"The research focuses on the study of Eurasianism, a political doctrine primarily developed in Russia, which founds its principles on classical geopolitics (Mackinder, Spykman, Haushofer, Schmitt) and on the ideology of conservatism. From a geopolitical point of view, following Mackinder scheme, Eurasianism claims that the international power that controls the Eurasian landmass can obtain global hegemony. It also believes in the dichotomy between thalassocratic power (represented today by Atlanticism) and telluric power (exemplified by Russia and China): this irreconcilable dualism is perceived as a strategic, cultural, and philosophical clash between two opposite worldviews, namely globalism and unipolarity on one hand and traditionalism and multipolarity on the other. Specifically, the research investigates Aleksandr Duginâ€™s neo-Eurasianist thought and its implications for the international system. After employing the analytical study of ideologies as a methodological tool, the research acknowledges Eurasianism as a full-fledged ideology and collocates it within the spectrum of conservative theories. It then analyzes the historical evolution of Eurasianism, from the early 20th century to its contemporary manifestations, paying specific attention to the works of early Eurasianists and of Lev N. Gumilev. Afterwards, it describes the liaison between Eurasianism and geopolitics, offering a quick overview â€“ both historical and theoretical â€“ on the nature of geopolitics, unfolding the foundations of geopolitical analysis according to Dugin. Consequently, the research portraits the main geopolitical theories that highlight the strategic role of the Eurasian landmass and of its core, namely Mackinderâ€™s â€œHeartland theoryâ€, Spykmanâ€™s â€œRimland theoryâ€, and Haushoferâ€™s Kontinentalblock project. After these premises, the study concentrates on the central elements of the neo-Eurasianist ideology, including the chief features of Duginâ€™s so-called â€œFourth Political Theoryâ€ and of his â€œEurasian Manifestoâ€. It also scrutinizes what Eurasianism considers to be its natural foes, namely post-liberalism, subjectivist individualism, unipolarity, Atlanticism, and globalism, in the attempt to understand why it is so. Moreover, specific attention is given to the Eurasianist vision of global order, focused on the quest for developing a multipolar world order which would be based on the overcoming of unipolarity, on Russiaâ€™s specific geopolitical mission, and on the subdivision of the world in geo-economic zones and great spaces. Finally, the research explores in more empirical terms three contemporary Eurasian initiatives aimed at integrating the Eurasian space, namely the Eurasian Economic Union, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, and the Belt and Road Initiative. 
The main hypotheses that the research assesses are the following. First, whether the Eurasianist ideology â€“ and specifically Duginâ€™s neo-Eurasianism â€“ would represent a theoretical contribution for the description of the advent of a multipolar international order or would it embody an inefficient, normatively biased, and often naive hermeneutic instrument. Second, whether geopolitical theories could still offer a valid tool for interpreting international relations and global power. Third, whether Eurasia could be considered a truly strategic continent for global hegemony.",2019,
Relationships between clinical protection and antibodies to Plasmodium falciparum RESA (ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigen) peptides.,"A longitudinal study involving 76 individuals living in Dafinso and VallÃ©e du Kou (near Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso, West Africa) was performed in June 1987 (beginning of the transmission period), August-September 1987 (during) and January 1988 (after). The serological antibody (Ab) responses against synthetic peptides representing repeat amino acid sequences of the P. falciparum Ring-Infected Erythrocyte Surface Antigen (RESA): (EENV)5, (EENVEHDA)4, (DDEHVEEPTVA)2 were evaluated by ELISA. The clinical longitudinal study during the transmission period allowed us to define three different groups in terms of age and occurrence of clinical malarial attack (greater than 5000 parasites mm-3 of blood and axillary fever greater than 37.7 degrees C). Levels (A620) of Ab to (EENVEHDA)4 and (DDEHVEEPTVA)2 were correlated with age. The adult group (III) had the highest prevalences of Ab to RESA peptides. No significant difference was found between groups of children with or without malaria attack. Nevertheless, at the beginning of the transmission period, children who had at least one malaria attack during the study presented the lowest level of antibodies to RESA peptides.",1991,International journal for parasitology

Multistep model for predicting upper-limb 3D isometric force application from pre-movement electrocorticographic features,"Neural correlates of movement planning onset and direction may be present in human electrocorticography in the signal dynamics of both motor and non-motor cortical regions. We use a three-stage model of jPCA reduced-rank hidden Markov model (jPCA-RR-HMM), regularized shrunken-centroid discriminant analysis (RDA), and LASSO regression to extract direction-sensitive planning information and movement onset in an upper-limb 3D isometric force task in a human subject. This mode achieves a relatively high true positive force-onset prediction rate of 60% within 250ms, and an above-chance 36% accuracy (17% chance) in predicting one of six planned 3D directions of isometric force using pre-movement signals. We also find direction-distinguishing information up to 400ms before force onset in the pre-movement signals, captured by electrodes placed over the limb-ipsilateral dorsal premotor regions. This approach can contribute to more accurate decoding of higher-level movement goals, at earlier timescales, and inform sensor placement.

It required NaCl for growth and exhibited optimal growth at 30â€‰Â°C, with 2â€Š% (w/v) NaCl and at pH 7-8. Cellular fatty acids were dominated by C16â€Š:â€Š0, summed feature 3 (C16â€Š:â€Š1Ï‰7c and/or C16â€Š:â€Š1Ï‰6c), C16â€Š:â€Š1Ï‰9c and C12â€Š:â€Š0 3-OH. The predominant isoprenoid quinone was ubiquinone-8 (Q-8). Polar lipids consisted of phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine. The DNA G+C content was 41.9â€‰mol%. Phylogeny based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain HMF4135T formed a distinct species-level lineage within the genus Thalassotalea of the class Gammaproteobacteria and was most closely related to Thalassotalea ponticola GJSW-36T (96.4â€Š% similarity). Based on the distinctive phenotypic characteristics and phylogenetic analysis, it is concluded that strain HMF4135T represents a novel species of the genus Thalassotalea, for which the name Thalassotalea litorea sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is HMF4135T (=KCTC 52154T=NBRC 112672T).",2017,International journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology
1486: Go-farther Score Model to Predict Survival after Ihca with Moderate or Less Cerebral Dysfunction,"Learning Objectives: Clinicians rely on their knowledge of prognosis to support patient decision-making regarding whether to enact Do Not Attempt Resuscitation (DNAPCR) orders. The Good Outcome Following Attempted Resuscitation (GO-FAR) Score is a well-validated tool that predicts survival after In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (IHCA) with no cerebral dysfunction (CPC â‰¤ 1). However, patients may consider survival with moderate cerebral dysfunction acceptable (CPC â‰¤ 2). Our objective was to validate the ability of the GO-FAR score to identify patients unlikely to survive IHCA with CPC â‰¤ 2 and to develop a modified GO-FAR score to accurately predict survival after IHCA with CPC â‰¤ 2. Methods: 54,425 inpatients with IHCA from 2012 2017. First, validation of the GO-FAR Score was attempted using survival with CPC â‰¤ 2. Next, the data were divided into training (44%), test (22%), and validation (34%) sets. Univariate analysis was used to identify variables with >3% absolute difference in survival with CPC â‰¤ 2, which were carried forward to a multivariate analysis. A final logistic regression model was created using Bayesian information criterion (BIC), and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). Candidate decision models were assessed using the test dataset to select the most parsimonious model that best classified patients as having a very poor (â‰¤5%), poor (6%10%), average (11%30%), or above average (>30%) likelihood of survival after CPR for IHCA with CPC â‰¤ 2. Results: The original GO FAR Score performed poorly for CPC â‰¤ 2. In the univariate model, age > 85, admission CPC < 2, and non-surgical admission had the largest association with outcome (-12.1%, -14.4%, and -18%, respectively). 13 variables were included in the logistic regression analysis. The final model accurately categorized 24.8% of patients with below average likelihood of CPC â‰¤ 2 in the training set, versus 21.5% and 22.4% in the testing and validation sets. Conclusions: The shared decision-making process must balance the patientâ€™s goals and values for medical treatment with an accurate estimate of a patientâ€™s chance of survival with an acceptable functional outcome. The GO-FARTHER Score extends the relevance of the GO-FAR Score to those patients with CPC â‰¤ 2.",2019,Critical Care Medicine

Scenario-based path travel time aggregation with Gaussian copula estimated through Lasso,"In this paper, we highlight the characteristics of floating car data, and extend our research on single link to pathes, To carry out the minimum risk routing decision, we need to estimate the distribution especially the tails of the path travel time. By the law of total probability, we propose to approximate the total path travel time distribution by the probability-weighted sum of a series of scenario-specific conditional path travel time distributions. Each of them is characterized by the sequence of entering time to the links of the path and the sequence is expressed as its corresponding (entering-time) positioning vector and window width vector.Any of such conditional distribution is the sum distribution of a sequence of link travel time distribution with specific dependence structure. The dependent structure is modeled by a lagged Gaussian copula while the marginal distributions are estimated by kernel method.The L1-constrain-minimization(Lasso) method is utilized to obtain an invertible covariance matrix of the Gaussian copula even for limited data. Compare to the iterative type procedure, this approach is efficient when the number of scenarios to visit is limited and it resolve the â€conditional distribution puzzleâ€ in the iterative formulas Keyword: Path Travel Time Distribution, Sum of Dependent Random Variables, Gaussian Copula,Lasso, Lagged Copula",2009,
Simultaneous Inference for High-dimensional Linear Models,"ABSTRACTThis article proposes a bootstrap-assisted procedure to conduct simultaneous inference for high-dimensional sparse linear models based on the recent desparsifying Lasso estimator. Our procedure allows the dimension of the parameter vector of interest to be exponentially larger than sample size, and it automatically accounts for the dependence within the desparsifying Lasso estimator. Moreover, our simultaneous testing method can be naturally coupled with the margin screening to enhance its power in sparse testing with a reduced computational cost, or with the step-down method to provide a strong control for the family-wise error rate. In theory, we prove that our simultaneous testing procedure asymptotically achieves the prespecified significance level, and enjoys certain optimality in terms of its power even when the model errors are non-Gaussian. Our general theory is also useful in studying the support recovery problem. To broaden the applicability, we further extend our main results to general...",2016,Journal of the American Statistical Association

"Ursachen, Verletzungen, Therapie und PrÃ¤ventionsmÃ¶glichkeiten von UnfÃ¤llen im Reitsport","ZusammenfassungHintergrundPferdesport ist mit einer hohen Anzahl von UnfÃ¤llen assoziiert. Allerdings existieren aufgrund mangelnder Kenntnisse Ã¼ber Unfallursachen/-mechanismen eingeschrÃ¤nkte MÃ¶glichkeiten der PrÃ¤vention. In der vorliegenden Studie wurden 198 ReitunfÃ¤lle analysiert und anhand der Ergebnisse Risikogruppen identifiziert sowie unfall- und somit verletzungsprÃ¤ventive MaÃŸnahmen formuliert.Material und MethodenIn diese 2-Center-Studie wurden Patienten eingeschlossen, die zwischen dem 01.01.2010 und 01.01.2011 aufgrund eines Reitunfalls in den BG-Unfallkliniken Berlin oder Hamburg behandelt wurden und der Studienteilnahme zustimmten. Anhand der klinikinternen Dokumentation und mittels eines Fragenbogens wurden Daten Ã¼ber die Demographie der verunfallten Reiter, genutzte Schutzkleidung zum Unfallzeitpunkt und Ã¼ber reitunfallassoziierte Verletzungen und Therapien evaluiert und analysiert.ErgebnisseEs handelte sich um 169 (85,5%) weibliche und 29 (14,5%) mÃ¤nnliche Reiter mit einem medianen Alter von 27,2 (5â€“74) Jahren; 55 Reiter (27,8%) waren <18Â Jahre alt; 134 (67,7%) Reiter wurden ambulant und 64 (32,3%) stationÃ¤r behandelt; 51 (25,8%) Reiter unterzogen sich einer operativen Therapie. Zum Unfallzeitpunkt trugen 66 (33,3%) Reiter einen Schutzhelm und 14 (7,1%) eine Schutzweste.DiskussionIm Gegensatz zu Schutzwesten kommen Helme im Reitsport zunehmend zum Einsatz. WÃ¤hrend Helme eine verletzungsprÃ¤ventive Funktion zu haben scheinen, konnte selbige bei Schutzwesten anhand unserer Daten nicht nachgewiesen werden. So erlitten in der vorliegenden Arbeit WestentrÃ¤ger prozentual mehr Verletzungen am OberkÃ¶rper als Nicht-WestentrÃ¤ger.

The possibilities of prevention are limited because of deficient knowledge about the causes and mechanisms of equine-related accidents. In the present study 198 equine-related accidents were analyzed and based on these data risk groups were identified and guidelines to improve safety in horse riding were formulated.Material and MethodsIn this 2-center study the accidents of 169 riders over a period of 12 months were analyzed. Data on equine-related patterns of injury and the resulting treatment were collated from the clinical records. Additionally, a questionnaire was completed on the day of trauma by the patients, which covered age, gender, the cause and mechanism of injury and the use of safety equipment at the time of the accident.ResultsThere were 169 (85.5%) female and 29 (14.5%) male riders with a median age of 27.2 years (range 5-74 years). Of the riders 55 (27.8%) were aged 18 years or younger, 134 (67.7%) riders were treated as outpatients while 64 (32.3%) required hospitalization, 51 (25.8%) required surgical treatment, 66 (33.3%) used a helmet and 14 (7.1%) a body protector at the time of accident.DiscussionEquestrians wear helmets increasingly more when riding but the willingness to wear body protectors is disappointing. Protective headgear has been proven to reduce the risk of injuries but based on these data a positive effect of body protectors could not be shown. In this study safety vest users suffered from injuries of the upper body more often than those who did not wear a body protector. Children and adolescents often overestimate their skills; therefore, teaching and supervision of inexperienced young riders along with the use of protective equipment can prevent major injuries.",2012,Der Unfallchirurg

The main purpose of this investigation is to analyse motivation and attitudes, towards languages in a plurilingual context. It draws on a study of 178 language students in two main universities one on the field of Teaching Education and the other one in the field of Health Care. A multiple-choice questionnaire was created to gather the data. It included some biographical items and, among others, some items on Attitudes and Motivation toward learning Spanish, Catalan, English and French. Considering the plurilingual setting, in which students lived, the main goal of the study was to explore attitudes and motivation toward language learning. The students self-assessment on those 4 languages was correlated with their answers related to attitudes and motivation toward those languages. Besides, ANOVAs were run to analyse the variability between and among different groups of students. The results supported the findings reported by other studies, showing a close relationship between attitudes, motivation and language achievement.",2005,
Use of a Vicryl lasso during insertion of locking screws.,"During nailing of long bones, retrieval of locking screws that get â€˜lostâ€™ in the soft tissues can be difficult especially in obese patients. We describe a simple technique to avoid this problem. A loop of No. I Vicryl is â€˜lassoedâ€™ around the neck of the screw and a clip is attached to its end. The screw is inserted as usual. If the screw gets mal-tracked in the soft tissues, a tug on this Vicryl loop will help to get the screw out. Just before full tightening of the screw, the Vicryl loop is either pulled out or cut. Since it is absorbable, cutting the loop does not result in any problem.",2003,Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England
Finding Causal Interactions in Video Sequences,"This paper considers the problem of detecting causal interactions in video clips. Specifically, the goal is to detect whether the actions of a given target can be explained in terms of the past actions of a collection of other agents. We propose to solve this problem by recasting it into a directed graph topology identification, where each node corresponds to the observed motion of a given target, and each link indicates the presence of a causal correlation. As shown in the paper, this leads to a block-sparsification problem that can be efficiently solved using a modified Group-Lasso type approach, capable of handling missing data and outliers (due for instance to occlusion and mis-identified correspondences). Moreover, this approach also identifies time instants where the interactions between agents change, thus providing event detection capabilities. These results are illustrated with several examples involving non-trivial interactions amongst several human subjects.",2013,2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision
Multi-label learning with prior knowledge for facial expression analysis,"Abstract Facial expression is one of the most expressive ways to display human emotions. Facial expression analysis (FEA) has been broadly studied in the past decades. In our daily life, few of the facial expressions are exactly one of the predefined affective states but are blends of several basic expressions. Even though the concept of â€˜blended emotionsâ€™ has been proposed years ago, most researchers did not deal with FEA as a multiple outputs problem yet. In this paper, multi-label learning algorithm for FEA is proposed to solve this problem. Firstly, to depict facial expressions more effectively, we model FEA as a multi-label problem, which depicts all facial expressions with multiple continuous values and labels of predefined affective states. Secondly, in order to model FEA jointly with multiple outputs, multi-label Group Lasso regularized maximum margin classifier (GLMM) and Group Lasso regularized regression (GLR) algorithms are proposed which can analyze all facial expressions at one time instead of modeling as a binary learning problem. Thirdly, to improve the effectiveness of our proposed model used in video sequences, GLR is further extended to be a Total Variation and Group Lasso based regression model (GLTV) which adds a prior term (Total Variation term) in the original model. JAFFE dataset and the extended Cohn Kanade (CK+) dataset have been used to verify the superior performance of our approaches with common used criterions in multi-label classification and regression realms.",2015,Neurocomputing
Accuracy of genomic predictions in Bos indicus (Nellore) cattle,"BackgroundNellore cattle play an important role in beef production in tropical systems and there is great interest in determining if genomic selection can contribute to accelerate genetic improvement of production and fertility in this breed. We present the first results of the implementation of genomic prediction in a Bos indicus (Nellore) population.MethodsInfluential bulls were genotyped with the Illumina Bovine HD chip in order to assess genomic predictive ability for weight and carcass traits, gestation length, scrotal circumference and two selection indices. 685 samples and 320 238 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were used in the analyses. A forward-prediction scheme was adopted to predict the genomic breeding values (DGV). In the training step, the estimated breeding values (EBV) of bulls were deregressed (dEBV) and used as pseudo-phenotypes to estimate marker effects using four methods: genomic BLUP with or without a residual polygenic effect (GBLUP20 and GBLUP0, respectively), a mixture model (Bayes C) and Bayesian LASSO (BLASSO). Empirical accuracies of the resulting genomic predictions were assessed based on the correlation between DGV and dEBV for the testing group.ResultsAccuracies of genomic predictions ranged from 0.17 (navel at weaning) to 0.74 (finishing precocity). Across traits, Bayesian regression models (Bayes C and BLASSO) were more accurate than GBLUP. The average empirical accuracies were 0.39 (GBLUP0), 0.40 (GBLUP20) and 0.44 (Bayes C and BLASSO). Bayes C and BLASSO tended to produce deflated predictions (i.e. slope of the regression of dEBV on DGV greater than 1). Further analyses suggested that higher-than-expected accuracies were observed for traits for which EBV means differed significantly between two breeding subgroups that were identified in a principal component analysis based on genomic relationships.ConclusionsBayesian regression models are of interest for future applications of genomic selection in this population, but further improvements are needed to reduce deflation of their predictions. Recurrent updates of the training population would be required to enable accurate prediction of the genetic merit of young animals. The technical feasibility of applying genomic prediction in a Bos indicus (Nellore) population was demonstrated. Further research is needed to permit cost-effective selection decisions using genomic information.",2013,"Genetics, Selection, Evolution : GSE"
