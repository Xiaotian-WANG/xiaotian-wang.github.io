A Strongly Consistent Sparse k-means Clustering with Direct l1 Penalization on Variable Weights,"We propose the Lasso Weighted $k$-means ($LW$-$k$-means) algorithm as a simple yet efficient sparse clustering procedure for high-dimensional data where the number of features ($p$) can be much larger compared to the number of observations ($n$). In the $LW$-$k$-means algorithm, we introduce a lasso-based penalty term, directly on the feature weights to incorporate feature selection in the framework of sparse clustering. $LW$-$k$-means does not make any distributional assumption of the given dataset and thus, induces a non-parametric method for feature selection. We also analytically investigate the convergence of the underlying optimization procedure in $LW$-$k$-means and establish the strong consistency of our algorithm. $LW$-$k$-means is tested on several real-life and synthetic datasets and through detailed experimental analysis, we find that the performance of the method is highly competitive against some state-of-the-art procedures for clustering and feature selection, not only in terms of clustering accuracy but also with respect to computational time.",2019,ArXiv
Proximal end of 15-year-old ventricular electrode penetrating pulmonary tissue â€“ a source of infection and a challenge for transvenous lead extraction,"We report a case of a 56-year-old man with a DDD pacemaker implanted in 1998 followed by additional ventricular lead implantation in 2000 due to lead dysfunction and battery replacement in 2006 (proximal end of the abandoned lead already observed in the pulmonary artery), with currently present clinical signs of lead-dependent infective endocarditis (LDIE). In March 2013 he was diagnosed with recurrent episodes of shortness of breath, cough and fever. Initially the patient was hospitalized in the pneumology ward and underwent a series of diagnostic examinations, including computed tomography (CT) and bronchoscopy. Chest CT revealed localized signs of inflammation (which could be differentiated from neoplastic lesions) in the mid-right pulmonary lobe. Given the vicinity of the migrated lead to the lung inflammatory process, penetration of the lead in the lung tissue was confirmed. Blood cultures were positive for Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSS). After cardiologist consultation the patient was transferred to the Cardiology Clinic with LDIE diagnosed. The patient was qualified for a transvenous lead extraction (TLE) procedure. Pre-operative transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed dilatation of the right atrium and ventricle with very high pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP = 80 mm Hg) calculated from tricuspid regurgitation. There were no signs of vegetations in transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) examination. The TLE procedure was performed in the cardiovascular operating room with on-site surgical standby. General anesthesia was used; invasive blood pressure, ECG, and ventilation parameters were monitored. At the beginning both functional leads were removed (using a Byrd dilator mechanical sheath). After unsuccessful grasping of the non-functional lead at the level of the right ventricle (due to adherences to the wall), it was successfully captured in the pulmonary artery using a pig-tail catheter; afterwards the proximal end was grasped in the right atrium lumen with a lasso catheter and the lead was finally extracted using the left subclavian approach and dilator sheaths (Figure 1). There were no procedural or post-procedural complications. Full radiological and clinical success was achieved. Postoperative TTE/TEE showed no signs of lead fragments or vegetations and reduction of PASP (60 mm Hg). As the patient was not pace-dependent, system reimplantation was delayed.

According to the current guidelines, indications for TLE of a non-functional lead present in the pulmonary bed should be considered as class IIb (extraction during procedure on cardiac implantable electronic device if contraindications are absent, the lead position might become dangerous) or even class IIa (potentially dangerous lead, which does not immediately threaten the patient) but not class III (despite anomalous lead displacement) [1]. Although the TLE complication rate remains low (about 2%) [2], longer dwelling time of the lead is a known risk factor of TLE, lead adherence to the vessel wall is much stronger after years, which often necessitates the use of extra tools [3]. Moreover, the proximal end of the broken lead in pulmonary tissue might have an impact on development of infection. Having in mind the fact that in spite of technical difficulties, the clinical success rate of TLE in patients with broken, migrating leads is comparable to the â€œstandardâ€ procedure [4], earlier extraction could prevent lead-related infections and reduce the potential procedural risk.",2015,PostÄ™py w Kardiologii Interwencyjnej = Advances in Interventional Cardiology
Automated Extraction of Results from Full Text Journal Articles,"Recent mandates by federal funding agencies and universities to create open access repositories of published research allow researchers a wealth of texts to analyze. Furthermore, some publishers of academic texts have begun creating policies to permit non-commercial text mining of journal articles. This project follows the approach of [7], which automatically extracts result sentences from full-text biomedical journal articles by using support vector machines and naive BÃ¤yes classifiers. I also experiment with using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) [6, 18] as a method to select features for the classifiers. I compare this new approach with other feature selection strategies used in previous studies.",2017,
Hybrid LASSO and Neural Network estimator for gaze estimation,"Gaze estimation has wide applications in drowsiness detection, security, and biomedical domains. The challenges in estimating the gaze angle include varying light conditions and subtle movements of the gaze. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has recently been suggested as a potential method for gaze estimation. In this present work, we have proposed a gaze estimator combining a neural network and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO). The features considered are both eye and head features. The combined estimator neural network-LASSO (NN-LASSO) outperforms the individual performance of neural network and LASSO estimator. The results are validated using MPII Gaze dataset and it has been shown that the proposed NN-LASSO estimator outperforms CNN in mean error sense.",2016,2016 IEEE Region 10 Conference (TENCON)
Inferring species interaction networks from species abundance data: A comparative evaluation of various statistical and machine learning methods,"Abstract The complexity of ecosystems is staggering, with hundreds or thousands of species interacting in a number of ways from competition and predation to facilitation and mutualism. Understanding the networks that form the systems is of growing importance, e.g. to understand how species will respond to climate change, or to predict potential knock-on effects of a biological control agent. In recent years, a variety of summary statistics for characterising the global and local properties of such networks have been derived, which provide a measure for gauging the accuracy of a mathematical model for network formation processes. However, the critical underlying assumption is that the true network is known. This is not a straightforward task to accomplish, and typically requires minute observations and detailed field work. More importantly, knowledge about species interactions is restricted to specific kinds of interactions. For instance, while the interactions between pollinators and their host plants are amenable to direct observation, other types of species interactions, like those mentioned above, are not, and might not even be clearly defined from the outset. To discover information about complex ecological systems efficiently, new tools for inferring the structure of networks from field data are needed. In the present study, we investigate the viability of various statistical and machine learning methods recently applied in molecular systems biology: graphical Gaussian models, L1-regularised regression with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), sparse Bayesian regression and Bayesian networks. We have assessed the performance of these methods on data simulated from food webs of known structure, where we combined a niche model with a stochastic population model in a 2-dimensional lattice. We assessed the network reconstruction accuracy in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, which was typically in the range between 0.75 and 0.9, corresponding to the recovery of about 60% of the true species interactions at a false prediction rate of 5%. We also applied the models to presence/absence data for 39 European warblers, and found that the inferred species interactions showed a weak yet significant correlation with phylogenetic similarity scores, which tended to weakly increase when including bio-climate covariates and allowing for spatial autocorrelation. Our findings demonstrate that relevant patterns in ecological networks can be identified from large-scale spatial data sets with machine learning methods, and that these methods have the potential to contribute novel important tools for gaining deeper insight into the structure and stability of ecosystems.",2010,Ecol.

A Family-Based Rare Haplotype Association Method for Quantitative Traits,"Background: The variants identified in genome-wide association studies account for only a small fraction of disease heritability. A key to this â€œmissing heritabilityâ€ is believed to be rare variants. Specifically, we focus on rare haplotype variant (rHTV). The existing methods for detecting rHTV are mostly population-based, and as such, are susceptible to population stratification and admixture, leading to an inflated false-positive rate. Family-based methods are more robust in this respect. Methods: We propose a method for detecting rHTVs associated with quantitative traits called family-based quantitative Bayesian LASSO (famQBL). FamQBL can analyze any type of pedigree and is based on a mixed model framework. We regularize the haplotype effects using Bayesian LASSO and estimate the posterior distributions using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Results: We conduct simulation studies, including analyses of Genetic Analysis Workshop 18 simulated data, to study the properties of famQBL and compare with a standard family-based haplotype association test implemented in FBAT (family-based association test) software. We find famQBL to be more powerful than FBAT with well-controlled false-positive rates. We also apply famQBL to the Framingham Heart Study data and detect an rHTV associated with diastolic blood pressure. Conclusion: FamQBL can help uncover rHTVs associated with quantitative traits.",2018,Human Heredity
GraphLIME: Local Interpretable Model Explanations for Graph Neural Networks,"Graph structured data has wide applicability in various domains such as physics, chemistry, biology, computer vision, and social networks, to name a few. Recently, graph neural networks (GNN) were shown to be successful in effectively representing graph structured data because of their good performance and generalization ability. GNN is a deep learning based method that learns a node representation by combining specific nodes and the structural/topological information of a graph. However, like other deep models, explaining the effectiveness of GNN models is a challenging task because of the complex nonlinear transformations made over the iterations. In this paper, we propose GraphLIME, a local interpretable model explanation for graphs using the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) Lasso, which is a nonlinear feature selection method. GraphLIME is a generic GNN-model explanation framework that learns a nonlinear interpretable model locally in the subgraph of the node being explained. More specifically, to explain a node, we generate a nonlinear interpretable model from its $N$-hop neighborhood and then compute the K most representative features as the explanations of its prediction using HSIC Lasso. Through experiments on two real-world datasets, the explanations of GraphLIME are found to be of extraordinary degree and more descriptive in comparison to the existing explanation methods.",2020,ArXiv
Narrow-spectrum inhibitors targeting an alternative menaquinone biosynthetic pathway of Helicobacter pylori.,"We aimed to identify narrow-spectrum natural compounds that specifically inhibit an alternative menaquinone (MK; vitamin K2) biosynthetic pathway (the futalosine pathway) of Helicobacter pylori. Culture broth samples of 6183 microbes were examined using the paper disc method with different combinations of 2 of the following 3 indicator microorganisms: Bacillus halodurans C-125 and Kitasatospora setae KM-6054(T), which have only the futalosine pathway of MK biosynthesis, and Bacillus subtilis H17, which has only the canonical MK biosynthetic pathway. Most of the active compounds isolated from culture broth samples were from the families of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Only one compound isolated from the culture broth of Streptomyces sp. K12-1112, siamycin I (a 21-residue lasso peptide antibiotic), targeted the futalosine pathway. The inhibitory activities of representative PUFAs and siamycin I against the growth of B.Â halodurans or K.Â setae were abrogated by supplementation with MK. Thereafter, the growth of H.Â pylori strains SS1 and TN2GF4 in broth cultures was dose-dependently suppressed by eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), or siamycin I, and these inhibitory effects were reduced by supplementation with MK. Daily administration of EPA (100Â Î¼M), DHA (100Â Î¼M), or siamycin I (2.5Â Î¼M) in drinking water reduced the H.Â pylori SS1 colonization in the gastric mucosa of C57BL/6 mice by 96%, 78%, and 68%, respectively. These data suggest that EPA, DHA, and siamycin I prevented H.Â pylori infection by inhibiting the futalosine pathway of MK biosynthesis.",2016,Journal of infection and chemotherapy : official journal of the Japan Society of Chemotherapy
Consistently accurate forecasts of temperature within buildings from sensor data using ridge and lasso regression,"Abstract A significant portion of all energy generated is used to heat and cool buildings. Some of that energy can be saved by using a temperature controller with access to an accurate forecast of a buildingâ€™s internal temperature. These forecasts depend on information gathered from sensors, including temperature, humidity, sunlight, and the electrical load of cooking and laundry appliances. Using publicly available data from two homes with a wide variety of sensors, we forecast internal temperature by modelling it as a linear function of recent sensor values. These models are built using techniques that improve upon standard least squares regression: forward stepwise, ridge and lasso regressions, using cross-validation. With lasso regression, we accurately forecast internal temperature every quarter hour over the next 48Â h within 1 . 8 Â° C in both houses. We also forecast temperature changes over each quarter-hour for the next two days, within 0 . 05 Â° C , which significantly improves on previous forecasts of temperature changes using the same data. We propose a business model for forecasting as a service, where guarantees of consistent accuracy are important for attracting clients and saving energy.",2018,Future Generation Computer Systems
Prediction of radiotherapy response with a 5â€microRNA signatureâ€based nomogram in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,"Radiotherapy is unlikely to benefit all patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Therefore, novel method is warranted to predict the radiotherapy response. Our study aimed to construct a microRNA (miRNA)-based nomogram to predict clinical outcomes of patients with HNSCC receiving radiotherapy. We screened out 56 differential miRNAs by analyzing 44 paired tumor and adjacent normal samples miRNA expression profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). A total of 307 patients with HNSCC receiving adjuvant radiotherapy were randomly divided into a training set (nÂ =Â 154) and a validation set (nÂ =Â 153). In the training set, we combined the differential miRNA profiles with clinical outcomes, and LASSO regression model was applied to establish a 5-miRNA signature. The prediction accuracy of the 5-miRNA signature was further validated. In addition, target genes of these miRNAs were predicted, and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis as well as KEGG pathway analysis was executed. A 5-miRNA signature including miR-99a, miR-31, miR-410, miR-424, and miR-495 was identified. With a cutoff value of 1.2201 from Youden's index, the training set was divided into high-risk and low-risk groups, and the 5-year overall survival was significantly different (30% vs. 73%, HR 3.65, CI 2.46-8.16; PÂ <Â 0.0001). Furthermore, our 5-miRNA signature revealed that only low-risk group would benefit from radiotherapy. Then, a nomogram combining 5-miRNA signature with clinical variables to predict radiotherapy response was constructed. The analysis of 108 target genes of these miRNAs revealed some potential mechanisms in HNSCC radiotherapy response for future investigations. In conclusion, the 5-miRNA signature-based nomogram is useful in predicting radiotherapy response in HNSCC and might become a promising tool to optimize radiation strategies.",2018,Cancer Medicine
TÃ©cnicas de regularizaÃ§Ã£o para mÃ¡quinas de aprendizado extremo,"Maquinas de Aprendizado Extremo (ELMs, do ingles Extreme Learning Machines) sao redes neurais com uma camada de entrada, uma camada intermediaria e uma camada de saida. Sua arquitetura e equivalente a do perceptron de multiplas camadas (MLP, do ingles Multilayer Perceptron), mas os pesos e o numero de neuronios da camada intermediaria em ELMs sao definidos arbitrariamente e a priori, enquanto os pesos da camada de saida sao os unicos parÃ¢metros ajustaveis durante o processo de treinamento supervisionado. O ajuste desses pesos da camada de saida leva a um problema de otimizacao linear, responsavel pelo fato de o treinamento de uma ELM ser ao menos uma ordem de magnitude mais rapido do que o treinamento de uma MLP. No entanto, o desempenho das ELMs e bastante influenciado pelo grau de regularizacao adotado no ajuste dos pesos da camada de saida. Alem disso, por serem definidos de forma arbitraria e nao estarem susceptiveis a treinamento, geralmente opera-se com um numero elevado de neuronios na camada intermediaria, sendo muito comum a presenca de neuronios redundantes e pouco funcionais, de modo que sua extracao nao compromete o desempenho da rede neural como um todo. Em vista desse cenario, esta dissertacao apresenta contribuicoes, junto a ELMs voltadas para tarefas de regressao, em duas frentes principais: (1) Definicao de um grau apropriado de regularizacao no calculo dos pesos da camada de saida de ELMs; e (2) Ajuste do numero de neuronios na camada intermediaria, pela extracao automatica de neuronios redundantes ou pouco funcionais. Mostra-se neste trabalho que, diferentemente do que e praticado na literatura, o grau de regularizacao mais indicado para uma ELM nao varia apenas entre problemas de regressao distintos, mas dentro do mesmo problema de regressao, ainda que se mantenha constante o numero de neuronios na camada intermediaria. Uma vez detectada a necessidade do ajuste do grau de regularizacao a cada configuracao de ELM, propoe-se aqui uma busca unidimensional mais refinada do que aquela ja existente na literatura. Quanto a proposta apresentada para definicao do numero de neuronios na camada intermediaria, faz-se uma analise do espaco de caracteristicas gerado pelos neuronios dessa camada e aplica-se poda de neuronios que pouco ou nada contribuem para gerar este espaco de caracteristicas. Alem disso, propoe-se o emprego de LASSO e Elastic Net como tecnicas de regularizacao, as quais promovem poda adicional de neuronios que nao contribuem para a tarefa de regressao. Para as duas contribuicoes do trabalho, sao apresentados resultados experimentais e comparacoes com outras propostas da literatura. Ha um aumento de custo computacional com as propostas deste trabalho, mas e expressivo o ganho em desempenho em alguns cenarios.

Biomechanical Performance of Hip Labral Repair Techniques.,"PURPOSE
To determine the strength of various suture techniques and the impact of suture passer size on cyclically loaded hip labra.


METHODS
We assigned 63 bovine hip labra to 9 simple knotless suture technique groups using OrthoCord suture: (1) penetrating grasper (2.6 mm)-placed horizontal mattress, (2) penetrating grasper-placed vertical mattress, (3) SutureLasso (1.8 mm)-placed vertical mattress, (4) penetrating grasper-placed oblique repair, (5) penetrating grasper-placed vertical mattress plus radiofrequency, (6) SutureLasso-placed horizontal mattress, (7) SutureLasso-placed oblique mattress, (8) SutureLasso-placed horizontal mattress plus radiofrequency, and (9) SutureLasso-placed oblique mattress plus radiofrequency. After 20 cycles of uniaxial tensile loading (5 to 80 N), destructive testing was performed.


RESULTS
Penetrating grasper-placed horizontal mattress sutures showed lower ultimate failure loads than vertical and oblique mattress sutures (P < .05). Penetrating grasper-placed vertical mattress sutures had higher peak-to-peak displacement than SutureLasso-placed vertical mattress sutures (PÂ = .04). SutureLasso-placed oblique mattress sutures had a higher ultimate load (P < .01) and stiffness (PÂ = .04) than SutureLasso-placed horizontal mattress sutures. SutureLasso-placed horizontal mattress sutures had lower cyclic elongation than penetrating grasper-placed horizontal mattress sutures (PÂ = .01) and lower ultimate load (P < .01) and stiffness than SutureLasso-placed vertical mattress sutures (P < .01). Horizontal mattress sutures with radiofrequency had a higher ultimate load (PÂ = .02), stiffness, and cyclic elongation (P < .01) than without radiofrequency.


CONCLUSIONS
A horizontal mattress hip labrum stitch shows a lower ultimate failure load than vertical or oblique mattress stitches. Smaller-diameter suture-passing devices show less cyclic displacement and elongation than larger-diameter devices. Radiofrequency labral treatment does not alter vertical stitch strength but does alter horizontal mattress stitch strength.


CLINICAL RELEVANCE
Vertical and oblique stitches are stronger than horizontal stitches. A 1.8-mm passing device shows a better cyclic loading performance than a 2.6-mm device.",2016,Arthroscopy : the journal of arthroscopic & related surgery : official publication of the Arthroscopy Association of North America and the International Arthroscopy Association
Pass-back chain extension expands multi-modular assembly line biosynthesis,"Modular nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) and polyketide synthase (PKS) enzymatic assembly lines are large and dynamic protein machines that generally effect a linear sequence of catalytic cycles. Here, we report the heterologous reconstitution and comprehensive characterization of two hybrid NRPSâ€“PKS assembly lines that defy many standard rules of assembly line biosynthesis to generate a large combinatorial library of cyclic lipodepsipeptide protease inhibitors called thalassospiramides. We generate a series of precise domain-inactivating mutations in thalassospiramide assembly lines, and present evidence for an unprecedented biosynthetic model that invokes intermodule substrate activation and tailoring, module skipping and pass-back chain extension, whereby the ability to pass the growing chain back to a preceding module is flexible and substrate driven. Expanding bidirectional intermodule domain interactions could represent a viable mechanism for generating chemical diversity without increasing the size of biosynthetic assembly lines and challenges our understanding of the potential elasticity of multimodular megaenzymes.Rather than operating linearly like most NRPSâ€“PKS systems, biosynthesis of the thalassospiramide lipopeptides employs intermodule substrate activation and tailoring, module skipping and pass-back chain extension to generate chemical diversity.",2019,Nature chemical biology
Graphical lasso quadratic discriminant function and its application to character recognition,"Multivariate Gaussian distribution is a popular assumption in many pattern recognition tasks. The quadratic discriminant function (QDF) is an effective classification approach based on this assumption. An improved algorithm, called modified QDF (or MQDF in short) has achieved great success and is widely recognized as the state-of-the-art method in character recognition. However, because both of the two approaches estimate the mean and covariance by the maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE), they often lead to the loss of the classification accuracy when the number of the training samples is small. To attack this problem, in this paper, we engage the graphical lasso method to estimate the covariance and propose a new classification method called the graphical lasso quadratic discriminant function (GLQDF). By exploiting a coordinate descent procedure for the lasso, GLQDF can estimate the covariance matrix (and its inverse) more precisely. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can perform better than the competitive methods on two artificial and nine real datasets (including both benchmark digit and Chinese character data).",2014,Neurocomputing
The effect of intrinsic loading and reconstruction upon grip capacity and finger extension kinematics.,"PURPOSE
To compare active and passive reconstructive procedures for tetraplegia and their ability to produce a powerful grip and allow appropriate finger extension in a cadaveric model.


METHODS
Seventeen fresh-frozen hands were used, which included 5 in intrinsic minus and intrinsic activation conditions, 6 with Zancolli-lasso tenodeses, and 6 with modified House tenodeses to simulate intrinsic function. To test grip, flexor digitorum profundus tendons were powered with a motor. Polyvinyl chloride cylinders of diameters 43, 51, 57, 70, or 89 mm and masses 250, 400, or 550 g were used. Grip was considered successful if the cylinder was grasped and resisted gravity. Finger extension was tested by powering the extensor tendons in the same hands.


RESULTS
No successful grasps were recorded in the intrinsic minus hands for larger diameter cylinders (â‰¥ 70 mm), whereas multiple successes were seen after intrinsic activation and after Zancolli-lasso and House procedures. Whereas active intrinsic and the House reconstruction reached near full extension, this was not true for the Zancolli-lasso group.


CONCLUSIONS
These data demonstrated that active and passive intrinsic reconstruction methods improved basic grasp and release kinematics in experimental cadaver hand models. Using our model and based on the more optimal kinematics and full extension of the House procedure, we suggest that this should be the preferred tenodesis-based intrinsic reconstruction method. Nevertheless, both procedures were equally successful at grasping objects of the sizes and masses studied.


CLINICAL RELEVANCE
Comparative clinical studies are indicated to corroborate the findings of this cadaveric hand model.",2015,The Journal of hand surgery

Fast global convergence rates of gradient methods for high-dimensional statistical recovery,"Many statistical M-estimators are based on convex optimization problems formed by the weighted sum of a loss function with a norm-based regularizes We analyze the convergence rates of first-order gradient methods for solving such problems within a high-dimensional framework that allows the data dimension d to grow with (and possibly exceed) the sample size n. This high-dimensional structure precludes the usual global assumptionsâ€” namely, strong convexity and smoothness conditionsâ€”that underlie classical optimization analysis. We define appropriately restricted versions of these conditions, and show that they are satisfied with high probability for various statistical models. Under these conditions, our theory guarantees that Nesterov's first-order method [12] has a globally geometric rate of convergence up to the statistical precision of the model, meaning the typical Euclidean distance between the true unknown parameter Î¸* and the optimal solution ^Î¸. This globally linear rate is substantially faster than previous analyses of global convergence for specific methods that yielded only sublinear rates. Our analysis applies to a wide range of M-estimators and statistical models, including sparse linear regression using Lasso (l1-regularized regression), group Lasso, block sparsity, and low-rank matrix recovery using nuclear norm regularization. Overall, this result reveals an interesting connection between statistical precision and computational efficiency in high-dimensional estimation.",2010,
[Toxoplasma serology in HIV infected patients and suspected cerebral toxoplasmosis at the Central Hospital of Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina Faso)].,"A study was conducted in the Internal Medicine unit of Bobo-Dioulasso Hospital. Of the 1828 HIV positive patients admitted in medical wards, 268 presented neurological symptoms. 25.4% had positive Toxoplasma gondii serology. Encephalitis was associated with 12.5% of this latter group and intracranial hypertension with focal neurological defects affected a further 47.5% of them. Presumptive treatment of toxoplasmosis led to significant clinical improvement in 60% of cases. Toxoplasma gondii serology should be part of the standard check-up for every HIV-infected patient, and toxoplasmosis chemoprophylaxis should be given to those with positive toxoplasma serology. Presumptive therapy of toxoplasmosis should be started for all HIV positive patients with focal neurological manifestations in the absence of a cerebral scanner.",2000,Bulletin de la Societe de pathologie exotique
Sparse representation classification via sequential Lasso screening,"The sparse representation of signals with respect to an over-complete dictionary has been of recent interest in a broad range of applications. One of the most used methods for obtaining sparse codes, the Lasso problem, becomes computationally costly for large dictionaries and this hinders the use of this approach to large-scale decision tasks. Recently, dictionary screening has been used to address this computational issue. In this spirit, we show how sequential Lasso screening can also facilitate faster completion of sparse representation decision tasks, such as classification, without affecting statistical accuracy. Moreover, the sequential screening process allows us to employ an early decision mechanism that can further accelerate classification, possibly at the cost of small decrease in accuracy.We demonstrate this empirically for several classification tasks. In particular, for clip-level music genre classification, using scattering features and a new voting scheme, we show that the proposed method yields improved clip classification accuracy and considerable computational speedup.",2013,2013 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing
Estimation of the reaction times in tasks of varying difficulty from the phase coherence of the auditory steady-state response using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator analysis,"Quantitative estimation of the workload in the brain is an important factor for helping to predict the behavior of humans. The reaction time when performing a difficult task is longer than that when performing an easy task. Thus, the reaction time reflects the workload in the brain. In this study, we employed an N-back task in order to regulate the degree of difficulty of the tasks, and then estimated the reaction times from the brain activity. The brain activity that we used to estimate the reaction time was the auditory steady-state response (ASSR) evoked by a 40-Hz click sound. Fifteen healthy participants participated in the present study and magnetoencephalogram (MEG) responses were recorded using a 148-channel magnetometer system. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), which is a type of sparse modeling, was employed to estimate the reaction times from the ASSR recorded by MEG. The LASSO showed higher estimation accuracy than the least squares method. This result indicates that LASSO overcame the over-fitting to the learning data. Furthermore, the LASSO selected channels in not only the parietal region, but also in the frontal and occipital regions. Since the ASSR is evoked by auditory stimuli, it is usually large in the parietal region. However, since LASSO also selected channels in regions outside the parietal region, this suggests that workload-related neural activity occurs in many brain regions. In the real world, it is more practical to use a wearable electroencephalography device with a limited number of channels than to use MEG. Therefore, determining which brain areas should be measured is essential. The channels selected by the sparse modeling method are informative for determining which brain areas to measure.",2015,2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)
Approches pÃ©nalisÃ©es et autres dÃ©veloppements statistiques pour l'Ã©pidÃ©miologie,"Mes travaux portent principalement sur des developpements statistiques theoriques, methodologiques ou appliques, en lien avec des problematiques rencontrees en epidemiologie et en recherche biomedicale. Les questions soulevees dans ces domaines d'application s'interpretent souvent comme un probleme de selection de variables. Celui-ci est des plus classiques en statistique, et des approches derivees de criteres penalises sont connues pour le resoudre sous certaines hypotheses. Sous des modeles parametriques, ces approches encouragent des structures particulieres dans le vecteur des parametres telles que la parcimonie ou l'egalite de certaines composantes, etc. Une part importante de mes recherches porte sur des resultats generaux pour les approches penalisees par la norme L1 des parametres ou des derivees de cette norme. Nous avons notamment developpe une methode de preselection qui permet l'elimination a priori de covariables dans les problemes de type lasso. L'objectif des methodes de preselection est de travailler avec des matrices de taille plus faible afin d'accelerer la resolution numerique du lasso, ou de pouvoir tout simplement le resoudre dans les cas ou la matrice originale est trop grande. Notre approche etait la premiere a beneficier de la propriete suivante : les covariables eliminees n'auraient de toute facon pas figure dans le support de la solution du lasso et notre approche ne modifie donc pas cette solution. Je me suis par ailleurs interesse aux proprietes asymptotiques des estimateurs derives du fused lasso generalise dans les modeles lineaires generalises. Le fused lasso generalise est particulierement adapte lorsque les covariables d'un modele de regression sont naturellement organisees en reseau (proteines, genes, etc.), et s'il est raisonnable d'attendre de covariables connectees dans le reseau qu'elles partagent des effets similaires sur la variable d'interet. Le fused lasso generalise repose sur un graphe qui decrit le reseau (et donc la structure attendue dans le vecteur des parametres), et nous avons etudie les proprietes des estimateurs du fused lasso generalise en fonction de l'adequation entre ce graphe et la veritable structure du vecteur des parametres du modele de regression. Par la suite, nous avons etendu le fused lasso generalise au contexte des modeles non lineaires a effets mixtes, qui sont utilises en pharmacocinetique pour modeliser les concentrations de medicament dans le sang au cours du temps, en fonction de parametres individuels inconnus (volume sanguin, taux d'absorption, etc.). Je me suis egalement interesse au contexte specifique des donnees stratifiees. Dans ce contexte, la question principale est de determiner si le niveau d'association entre deux variables est identique chez tous les individus d'une population ou si au contraire il varie a travers des sous-groupes predefinis de cette population (ou strates). Le fused lasso generalise est adapte a ce contexte, mais souffre de certaines limites. J'ai travaille au developpement d'une nouvelle approche, et etudie ses proprietes theoriques, reposant sur une penalite specialement adaptee a l'identification des heterogeneites entre les parametres de modeles de regression definis dans differentes strates. Outre les modeles de regression, je me suis interesse aux approches penalisees dans le cadre de l'estimation des modeles graphiques binaires, qui permettent l'etude des relations d'independance conditionnelle parmi un ensemble de variables binaires. Enfin, les etudes epidemiologiques soulevent le plus souvent la question de l'inference des effets causaux des facteurs de risque etudies, et je me suis dernierement interesse a l'application des principes de l'inference causale en epidemiologie du risque routier.",2016,
Influence Plots for LASSO,"With many predictors in regression, fitting the full model can induce multicollinearity problems. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operation (LASSO) is useful when the effects of many explanatory variables are sparse in a high-dimensional dataset. Influential points can have a disproportionate impact on the estimated values of model parameters. This paper describes a new influence plot that can be used to increase understanding of the contributions of individual observations and the robustness of results. This can serve as a complement to other regression diagnostics techniques in the LASSO regression setting. Using this influence plot, we can find influential points and their impact on shrinkage of model parameters and model selection. We illustrate the methods with two examples.

Analysis of energy signatures and planning of heating and domestic hot water energy use in buildings in Norway,"Widespread introduction of low energy buildings (LEBs), passive houses, and zero emission buildings (ZEBs) are national target in Norway. In order to achieve better energy performance in these types of buildings and successfully integrate them in energy system, reliable planning and prediction techniques for heat energy use are required. However, the issue of energy planning in LEBs currently remains challenging for district heating companies. This article proposed an improved methodology for planning and analysis of domestic hot water and heating energy use in LEBs based on energy signature method. The methodology was tested on a passive school in Oslo, Norway. In order to divide energy signature curve on temperature dependent and independent parts, it was proposed to use piecewise regression. Each of these parts were analyzed separately. The problem of dealing with outliers and selection of the factors that had impact of energy was considered. For temperature dependent part, the different methods of modelling were compared by statistical criteria. The investigation showed that linear multiple regression model resulted in better accuracy in the prediction than SVM, PLS, and LASSO models. In order to explain temperature independent part of energy signature the hourly profiles of energy use were developed.",2019,

Computational prediction of plasma protein binding of cyclic peptides from small molecule experimental data using sparse modeling techniques,"BackgroundCyclic peptide-based drug discovery is attracting increasing interest owing to its potential to avoid target protein depletion. In drug discovery, it is important to maintain the biostability of a drug within the proper range. Plasma protein binding (PPB) is the most important index of biostability, and developing a computational method to predict PPB of drug candidate compounds contributes to the acceleration of drug discovery research. PPB prediction of small molecule drug compounds using machine learning has been conducted thus far; however, no study has investigated cyclic peptides because experimental information of cyclic peptides is scarce.ResultsFirst, we adopted sparse modeling and small molecule information to construct a PPB prediction model for cyclic peptides. As cyclic peptide data are limited, applying multidimensional nonlinear models involves concerns regarding overfitting. However, models constructed by sparse modeling can avoid overfitting, offering high generalization performance and interpretability. More than 1000 PPB data of small molecules are available, and we used them to construct a prediction models with two enumeration methods: enumerating lasso solutions (ELS) and forward beam search (FBS). The accuracies of the prediction models constructed by ELS and FBS were equal to or better than those of conventional non-linear models (MAEâ€‰=â€‰0.167â€“0.174) on cross-validation of a small molecule compound dataset. Moreover, we showed that the prediction accuracies for cyclic peptides were close to those for small molecule compounds (MAEâ€‰=â€‰0.194â€“0.288). Such high accuracy could not be obtained by a simple method of learning from cyclic peptide data directly by lasso regression (MAEâ€‰=â€‰0.286â€“0.671) or ridge regression (MAEâ€‰=â€‰0.244â€“0.354).ConclusionIn this study, we proposed a machine learning techniques that uses low-dimensional sparse modeling to predict the PPB value of cyclic peptides computationally. The low-dimensional sparse model not only exhibits excellent generalization performance but also improves interpretation of the prediction model. This can provide common an noteworthy knowledge for future cyclic peptide drug discovery studies.",2018,BMC Bioinformatics

Compressed Sensing in Scanning Tunneling Microscopy/Spectroscopy for Observation of Quasi-Particle Interference,"We applied a method of compressed sensing to the observation of quasi-particle interference (QPI) by scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy to improve efficiency and save measurement time. To solve an ill-posed problem owing to the scarcity of data, the compressed sensing utilizes the sparseness of QPI patterns in momentum space. We examined the performance of a sparsity-inducing algorithm called least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and demonstrated that LASSO enables us to recover a double-circle QPI pattern of the Ag(111) surface from a dataset whose size is less than that necessary for the conventional Fourier transformation method.

CaracteritzaciÃ³ del gen GAS6 i associaciÃ³ amb malalties humanes,"El producte de ""growth arrest-specific gene6"" (""GAS6"") es un lligand per als receptors tirosina quinasa TYRO3, AXL i MERTK (TAM). Aquesta proteina dependent de la vitamina K, esta estructuralment relacionada amb la Proteina S anticoagulant i ha estat implicada en diferents mecanismes de supervivencia, proliferacio i adhesio cellulars i la inhibicio de lapoptosi. El fet que el ratoli deficient en Gas6 estigues protegit en front depisodis trombotics demostra la importancia del paper daquesta proteina en el sistema cardiovascular.
Lestructura genetica i proteica de ""GAS6"" es altament homologa amb la de la Proteina S. La present tesi tenia com a objectiu determinar lestructura dexons i dintrons del gen GAS6 per tal danalitzar posteriorment la presencia de variants al gen que puguessin estar associades a malalties humanes.
Lanalisi bioinformatic ens va permetre localitzar 15 exons de GAS6, determinar-ne les sequencies daquests i de les seves regions introniques flanquejants en una regio que ocupa 43,5 Kb al brac llarg del cromosoma 13. Un cop obtinguda aquesta estructura es procedi a identificar la presencia de variants alleliques mitjancant lanalisi amb SSCP de productes amplificats de PCR (de mostres de DNA dun grup dindividus control) que contenien les sequencies exoniques amb les seves regions introniques flanquejants. Aquestes analisis revelaren la presencia de diferents variants alleliques que varen ser confirmades com a polimorfismes de cadena senzilla (SNP). Un primer estudi dassociacio daquests SNP identificats mostra que un daquests polimorfismes (c.834+7G>A a lintro 8 de ""GAS6"") presentava una diferencia estadisticament significativa en la distribucio allelica i genotipica en el grup de pacients respecte a la poblacio control en una poblacio amb malaltia aterotrombotica, sobretot en el subgrup de malaltia cerebrovascular. Posteriorment, es va realitzar la confirmacio daquests resultats en una poblacio amb malatia cerebrovascular molt mes gran i independent de lanterior utilitzant estudis de genotips i haplotips, i es confirma lassociacio del genotip c.834+7 AA amb la reduccio del risc per a la malaltia cerebrovascular.

"" SUMMARY:
The product of the growth arrest-specific gene 6 (GAS6), a ligand for the TYRO3,AXL, and MERTK tyrosine kinase receptors, is a vitamin K-dependent protein, structurally related to anticoagulant protein S. Gas6-deficient mice are protected against thrombosis, demonstrating the importance of this protein in the cardiovascular system.
The present thesis was aimed at determining the human GAS6 intronexon structure and analyzing the gene for the presence of allelic variants that could be associated with human diseases. Online analyses allowed us to localize 15 GAS6 exons and to determine the sequence of their intron-flanking regions, in a chromosome 13 region spanning 43.5 kb of DNA. SSCP analysis of PCR-amplified GAS6 exons with their intron-flanking regions from control DNA samples, revealed the presence of different variants, which were confirmed to be single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A preliminary analysis of these SNPs in a group of patients with atherothrombotic disease revealed statistically significant differences between controls and stroke patients in the allelic distributions of one of these variants (c.834+7G>A in intron 8). We confirmed these results in a larger and independent stroke population using genotype and haplotype studies: the GAS6 c.834+7AA genotype was found associated with decreased risk for stroke (OR:0.59; 95%CI:0.37-0.93). Furthermore, haplotype analysis revealed that association was even stronger (OR:0.48;95%CI:0.28-0.83, for ischemic stroke) when the c.834+7 A allele was present in a specific haplotype (CACA) of four GAS6 polymorphisms (rs8191973, rs7331124, rs7323932, rs8191974).These results suggest a protective role for stroke of this haplotype.

Quantile regression in high-dimension with breaking,"The paper considers a linear regression model in high-dimension for which the predictive variables can change the influence on the response variable at unknown times (called change-points). Moreover, the particular case of the heavy-tailed errors is considered. In this case, least square method with LASSO or adaptive LASSO penalty can not be used since the theoretical assumptions do not occur or the estimators are not robust. Then, the quantile model with SCAD penalty or median regression with LASSO-type penalty allows, in the same time, to estimate the parameters on every segment and eliminate the irrelevant variables. We show that, for the two penalized estimation methods, the oracle properties is not affected by the change-point estimation. Convergence rates of the estimators for the change-points and for the regression parameters, by the two methods are found. Monte-Carlo simulations illustrate the performance of the methods.",2013,JSTA
Adhesion Signaling States in AML,"Background Stromal contact in the bone marrow microenvironment is known to affect the resistance of leukemic cells to therapy, in particular the homing and engraftment of leukemic stem cells. This stromal interaction is mediated by the adhesion signaling pathway including extracellular matrix proteins (e.g. FN1, SPP1), cell surface and transmembrane proteins (e.g. CD44, integrin, CAV1), as well as intracellular binding proteins and enzymes (e.g. IGFBP2, PTK2, TGM2). Previous studies mostly examined these proteins in isolation, and hence they were unable to capture the coordination among subpathways and within patient subpopulations. Therefore, it is of key interest to study these proteins in their ensemble and obtain a holistic view of how adhesion signaling pathway gives rise to and affects different AML subpopulations. Methods To profile protein expressions in AML, we made a reverse phase protein array (RPPA) with proteins from leukemia enriched cells from 511 new AML patients. Both bone marrow (n=387) and peripheral blood (n=283) samples were used, with 140 cases having both. The RPPA was probed with 231 strictly validated antibodies, including antibodies against ITGA2, ITGB3, FN1, ITGAL, PTK2, IGFBP2, CD44, SPP1, CAV1 and TGM2. The normal bone marrow derived CD34+ cells were used for comparison. The protein expression data generated from this RPPA was then analyzed by the Standard Proteomic Analysis (SPA), a combination of computational methods including clustering, principal component analysis, network reconstruction ( glasso ), survival analysis, correlation tests and data mining from public databases. Results Based on the expression levels of ten proteins in the adhesion pathway, we first built a heatmap (Figure A) using â€œ Prototype Clustering â€ that grouped all patients into six distinct clusters featured by C1) pan low, C2) high SPP1-CD44; C3) high CAV1; C4) high PTK2-ITGA2-ITGB3-FN1-IGFBP2-TGM2; C5) high TGM2; C6) high ITGAL and pan intermediate high expression levels. The adhesion pathway in AML showed literature-consistent patterns, e.g. the coupling between CD44 and SPP1 and the co-expression among integrin subunits, FN1 and PTK2, but also demonstrated new patterns, e.g. independent regulation of CAV1, as well as decoupled expression of TGM2 from the integrins. Each patient cluster represents an adhesion signaling state that can be seen in AML. As shown in this transition map (Figure B), there is an OFF state (C1), two isolated activation states of either CAV1 (C3) or CD44-SPP1 (C2), two intermediate activation states of either TGM2 (C5) or ITGAL (C6), and a combined activation state (C4) from the two intermediate states. By combining both connections inferred from the data and interactions collected from public databases (e.g. String, KEGG), we were able to expand the protein network beyond adhesion pathway and examine their expression levels in each adhesion signaling state. We observed positive co-regulation of SRC and PRKCA with the integrin subunits, connections between IGFBP2 and metabolism/synthesis proteins (e.g. GADPH, EIF4E, GSK), as well as the association of CD44 with histone modification (H3K4Me2, H3K4Me3), most of which have not been reported before. The adhesion activation states are not associated with most clinical correlates, including FLT3 and NPM1 mutation, gender and response status, with the exception of the CAV1 activation state (C3). A significant amount of patients with high CAV1 expression levels are in the favorable cytogenetics group (35% vs. 8% in general, p=0.00001), thus have fewer relapses (relapse rate of 26% vs. 64% in general, p=0.001) and superior overall survival (Figure C) and remission duration (Figure D). Conclusions We have discovered previously unrecognized protein expression patterns and activation states that control stromal contact and adhesion in AML. This includes independent activation of SPP1-CD44 and CAV1, intermediate activation of TGM2 and ITGAL and combined activation of integrin-FN1-PTK2, indicating diverse stromal interaction states in the bone marrow. In particular, the activation of CAV1 is prognostically favorable, suggesting a potential target for future therapeutics in AML. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",2014,Blood
A General Framework for Structured Sparsity via Proximal Optimization,"We study a generalized framework for structured sparsity. It extends the well known methods of Lasso and Group Lasso by incorporating additional constraints on the variables as part of a convex optimization problem. This framework provides a straightforward way of favouring prescribed sparsity patterns, such as orderings, contiguous regions and overlapping groups, among others. Available optimization methods are limited to specific constraint sets and tend to not scale well with sample size and dimensionality. We propose a first order proximal method, which builds upon results on fixed points and successive approximations. The algorithm can be applied to a general class of conic and norm constraints sets and relies on a proximity operator subproblem which can be computed numerically. Experiments on different regression problems demonstrate state-of-the-art statistical performance, which improves over Lasso, Group Lasso and StructOMP. They also demonstrate the efficiency of the optimization algorithm and its scalability with the size of the problem.",2012,
Multicategory Vertex Discriminant Analysis for High-dimensional Data,"In response to the challenges of data mining, discriminant analysis continues to evolve as a vital branch of statistics. Our recently introduced method of vertex discriminant analysis (VDA) is ideally suited to handle multiple categories and an excess of predictors over training cases. The current paper explores an elaboration of VDA that conducts classification and variable selection simultaneously. Adding lasso (l-norm) and Euclidean penalties to the VDA loss function eliminates unnecessary predictors. Lasso penalties apply to each predictor coefficient separately; Euclidean penalties group the collective coefficients of a single predictor. With these penalties in place, cyclic coordinate descent accelerates estimation of all coefficients. Our tests on simulated and benchmark real data demonstrate the virtues of penalized VDA in model building and prediction in high-dimensional settings.",2010,The Annals of Applied Statistics

Pretreatment Prediction of Adaptive Radiation Therapy Eligibility Using MRI-Based Radiomics for Advanced Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Patients,"Background and purpose: Adaptive radiotherapy (ART) can compensate for the dosimetric impacts induced by anatomic and geometric variations in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC); Yet, the need for ART can only be assessed during the radiation treatment and the implementation of ART is resource intensive. Therefore, we aimed to determine tumoral biomarkers using pre-treatment MR images for predicting ART eligibility in NPC patients prior to the start of treatment. Methods: Seventy patients with biopsy-proven NPC (Stage II-IVB) in 2015 were enrolled into this retrospective study. Pre-treatment contrast-enhanced T1-w (CET1-w), T2-w MR images were processed and filtered using Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) filter before radiomic features extraction. A total of 479 radiomics features, including the first-order (n = 90), shape (n = 14), and texture features (n = 375), were initially extracted from Gross-Tumor-Volume of primary tumor (GTVnp) using CET1-w, T2-w MR images. Patients were randomly divided into a training set (n = 51) and testing set (n = 19). The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression model was applied for radiomic model construction in training set to select the most predictive features to predict patients who were replanned and assessed in the testing set. A double cross-validation approach of 100 resampled iterations with 3-fold nested cross-validation was employed in LASSO during model construction. The predictive performance of each model was evaluated using the area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). Results: In the present cohort, 13 of 70 patients (18.6%) underwent ART. Average AUCs in training and testing sets were 0.962 (95%CI: 0.961-0.963) and 0.852 (95%CI: 0.847-0.857) with 8 selected features for CET1-w model; 0.895 (95%CI: 0.893-0.896) and 0.750 (95%CI: 0.745-0.755) with 6 selected features for T2-w model; and 0.984 (95%CI: 0.983-0.984) and 0.930 (95%CI: 0.928-0.933) with 6 selected features for joint T1-T2 model, respectively. In general, the joint T1-T2 model outperformed either CET1-w or T2-w model alone. Conclusions: Our study successfully showed promising capability of MRI-based radiomics features for pre-treatment identification of ART eligibility in NPC patients.",2019,Frontiers in Oncology
Genomic prediction applied to high-biomass sorghum for bioenergy production,"The increasing cost of energy and finite oil and gas reserves have created a need to develop alternative fuels from renewable sources. Due to its abiotic stress tolerance and annual cultivation, high-biomass sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) shows potential as a bioenergy crop. Genomic selection is a useful tool for accelerating genetic gains and could restructure plant breeding programs by enabling early selection and reducing breeding cycle duration. This work aimed at predicting breeding values via genomic selection models for 200 sorghum genotypes comprising landrace accessions and breeding lines from biomass and saccharine groups. These genotypes were divided into two sub-panels, according to breeding purpose. We evaluated the following phenotypic biomass traits: days to flowering, plant height, fresh and dry matter yield, and fiber, cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin proportions. Genotyping by sequencing yielded more than 258,000 single-nucleotide polymorphism markers, which revealed population structure between subpanels. We then fitted and compared genomic selection models BayesA, BayesB, BayesCÏ€, BayesLasso, Bayes Ridge Regression and random regression best linear unbiased predictor. The resulting predictive abilities varied little between the different models, but substantially between traits. Different scenarios of prediction showed the potential of using genomic selection results between sub-panels and years, although the genotype by environment interaction negatively affected accuracies. Functional enrichment analyses performed with the marker-predicted effects suggested several interesting associations, with potential for revealing biological processes relevant to the studied quantitative traits. This work shows that genomic selection can be successfully applied in biomass sorghum breeding programs.",2018,Molecular Breeding

Nonlinear sparse partial least squares: an investigation of the effect of nonlinearity and sparsity on the decoding of intracranial data.,"OBJECTIVE
Partial Least Squares regression is a suitable linear decoder model for correlated and high dimensional neural data. This algorithm has been widely used in the application of brain-computer interface (BCI) for decoding of motor parameters. PLS does not consider nonlinear relations between brain signal features. The nonlinear version of PLS that considers a nonlinear relationship between the latent variables has not been proposed for the decoding of intracranial data. This nonlinear model may cause overfitting in some cases due to more number of free parameters. In this paper, we develop a new version of nonlinear PLS namely nonlinear sparse PLS (NLS PLS) and test it in the BCI applications.


APPROACH
In motor related BCI systems, improving the decoding accuracy of both kinetic and kinematic parameters of movement is crucial. To do this, two BCI datasets were chosen to decode the force amplitude and position of hand trajectory using the nonlinear and sparse versions of PLS algorithm. In our new NLS PLS method, we considered a polynomial relationship between the latent variables and used the lasso penalization in the latent space to avoid overfitting and to improve the decoding accuracy.


MAIN RESULTS
Some linear and nonlinear based PLS models and our new proposed method, NLS PLS were applied to the two datasets. According to our results, significant improvement of NLS PLS method is confirmed over other methods. Our results show that nonlinear PLS outperforms generic PLS in the force decoding but it has lower accuracy in the hand trajectory decoding because of high dimensional feature space. By using lasso penalization, we presented a sparse nonlinear PLS-based model that outperforms generic PLS in both datasets and improves the coefficient of determination, 34% in the force decoding and 10% in the hand trajectory decoding.


SIGNIFICANCE
We construct a simple PLS-based model that considers a nonlinear relationship between features and it is also robust to overfitting because of using the lasso penalty in the latent space. This model is suitable for a high dimensional and correlated datasets like intracranial data and can improve the accuracy of estimation.",2019,Journal of neural engineering
A source localization approach based on structured sparsity for broadband far-field sources,"In this work, we present a source localization method for broadband sources impinging from the far-field on a uniform linear array (ULA) of sensors, based on a group sparsity structure over the different frequency bands and the joint sparsity structure over several time snapshots. I. SPARSITY BASED NARROWBAND SOURCE LOCALIZATION Source localization has been an active research field, playing fundamental role in many signal processing areas such as radar, sonar, seismology and acoustic tracking. The problem may also be referred to as Direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation, when arrays of sensors are employed, and its main objective is to give an estimate of the spatial energy spectrum and therefore determine the number and location of the sources of energy corresponding to the peaks of the spatial spectrum. The emerging field of sparse representations and compressed sensing (CS) has given renewed interest to the problem of source localization. The concept of spatial sparsity was first introduced in [1], where it was shown that the source localization problem can be cast as a sparse representations problem in a redundant dictionary and the `1-SVD method was proposed for the recovery of the inverse system. In [2], the dicionary is generated after the discretization of the angular space, containing the impulse responses for each potential direction of arrival. The dictionary is overcomplete meaning that the number of sensors is smaller than the number of possible locations (DOAs). Therefore, considering a linear array of M sensors, the array output can be expressed as: y(t) = Î¦s(t) + n(t) (1) where s(t) is a k-sparse vector of length N , y(t) is a M Ã— 1 measurements vector of the array of sensors and n(t) is the additive noise vector. Î¦ is a redundant dictionary as M < N , which contains the array responses of the potential angles of arrival: Î¦ = [a(Î¸1), . . . ,a(Î¸N )]. (2) The sparse solution to the above underdetermined system of linear equations can be approximated using convex optimization (e.g. Lasso or BPDN) or greedy approaches (e.g. OMP, CoSaMP, IHT etc.). However, this single snapshot approach requires that the inverse problem should be solved at each time index separately. By taking multiple snapshots and assuming that ths sources are not moving, as described in [2], we can formulate the source localization problem as a multiple measurement vector (MMV) joint sparse recovery problem, exploiting the fact that the sources will share a common support over all time snapshots: Y = Î¦S + N (3) where Y and N are M Ã—L matrices and S is a N Ã—L matrix with L equals the number of time snapshots. Therefore, by enforcing only spatial sparsity and not temporal one can use convex optimization (e.g. `1/`2 minimization) or greedy methods (e.g. SOMP) to recover the joint sparse entries. II. PROPOSED APPROACH FOR BROADBAND SOURCES The described source localization methods of the previous section assume that the impinging sources on the array of sensors are narrowband centered at a carrier frequency. In the case of broadband sources, we first need to transform the data into the time-frequency domain and assume that each frequency bin contains the energy of k narrowband sources. Also, in the broadband scenario the manifold matrices (or redundant dictionaries) are different for different frequency bands due to the fact that the central carrier frequency varies. Subsequently, a naive approach could be to use the joint sparsity model for several time snapshots at each frequency bin Ï‰q:",2011,
Decidable Problems for Probabilistic Automata on Infinite Words,"We consider probabilistic automata on infinite words with acceptance defined by parity conditions. We consider three qualitative decision problems: (i) the positive decision problem asks whether there is a word that is accepted with positive probability; (ii) the almost decision problem asks whether there is a word that is accepted with probability 1; and (iii) the limit decision problem asks whether words are accepted with probability arbitrarily close to 1. We unify and generalize several decidability results for probabilistic automata over infinite words, and identify a robust (closed under union and intersection) subclass of probabilistic automata for which all the qualitative decision problems are decidable for parity conditions. We also show that if the input words are restricted to lasso shape (regular) words, then the positive and almost problems are decidable for all probabilistic automata with parity conditions. For most decidable problems we show an optimal PSPACE-complete complexity bound.",2012,2012 27th Annual IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science
A Target Selection Model for the Counseling Services in Long-Term Care Insurance,"In the long-term care insurance (LTCI) system, National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) provide counseling services for beneficiaries and their family caregivers, which help them use LTC services appropriately. The purpose of this study was to develop a Target Selection Model for the Counseling Services based on needs of beneficiaries and their family caregivers. To develope models, we used data set of total 2,000 beneficiaries and family caregivers who have used the long-term care services in their home in March 2013 and completed questionnaires. The Target Selection Model was established through various data-mining models such as logistic regression, gradient boosting, Lasso, decision-tree model, Ensemble, and Neural network. Lasso model was selected as the final model because of the stability, high performance and availability. Our results might improve the satisfaction and the efficiency for the NHIS counseling services.",2015,

Linguistic Research and Why It Matters: An Example and Some Personal Reflections,"ABSTRACT. In this presidential address, I first focus narrowly on quantitative research on the semantic interpretation of noun-noun Spanish compound words in early and late Spanish-English bilinguals. Later, I reexamine this case study to show that even theoretical linguistic research reflects its circumstances, is responsive to its immediate community, and connects with society at large. I focus on the role played by our graduate students, the newest members of our scholarly COMMUNITY, in the development of our own research, as well as by undergraduate students, who by collecting data become participants in our scientific CULTURE. Additionally, I show that our research leads to COLLABORATION with specialists in other fields and to increased COMMUNICATION with departmental colleagues. Finally, the value added by linguistics research like this one to our academic units becomes apparent in COMPARISONS of placement opportunities for graduate students with and without expertise in language. ********** 1. INTRODUCTION. Allow me to begin this Presidential address with some personal reflections. The year 2010 was a watershed in my own life in many ways. I became, in this order, a tenured associate professor in the Department of Hispanic Studies at Texas A&M University, the President of LASSO, and a naturalized citizen of the United States. So I am fully aware of the honor of addressing a captive audience of some of the best linguists in the Southwest (and beyond) without having to vie for their attention with other presenters in concurrent sessions. Moreover, after many years of pretending that linguistics is a neutral field, I have my first opportunity to tackle the big issues of our time head-on without fear of unemployment or deportation. In the present social and economic climate, those circumstances make me very lucky indeed, and I am grateful for all of them, but most especially for my readers. In going over past Presidential addresses, I found that a common thread of my predecessors was to go beyond the details of their own academic work, and to paint the big picture, taking advantage of the larger canvas and aiming to please an audience with eclectic tastes. I hope to achieve similar results, but I will proceed by first focusing quite narrowly on data and results from my own recent quantitative research. Later, I will reexamine these apparently disembodied and cold experimental data and show that they are in fact vivid reflections of the world in which they were created. Using this paper-within-a-paper approach, I hope to underscore the fact that all of our research reflects its circumstances, regardless of our best efforts at timeless objectivity. But this is not a cautionary tale about our failings at scientificity, but a celebration of our strength as academics who are responsive to their communities. As linguists we benefit from making these connections more explicit to our scholarly colleagues, to our university administrations, to our students, and to society at large, including the taxpayers who fund our salaries and the legislators who are forever tempted to chop them. So let me begin by giving an overview of the paper and of the background to this work. For the past ten years or so, I have been involved in the study of compound words in Spanish. For some early examples see Moyna (2000, 2004). Compounds are lexemes that are constructed by combining preexisting lexemes or lexical stems. An example in Spanish would be sacapuntas 'pencil sharpener,' lit. 'remove-tips,' which is made up of a verbal stem saca 'to remove' and its nominal direct object puntas 'tips.' Compounding in Spanish is not nearly as frequent as in the Germanic languages, such as English. The study of compound history, in particular, had been greatly neglected until I undertook what I think is the first comprehensive account of their evolution. Soon after I embarked on this enterprise as part of my doctoral dissertation, I realized why angels had feared to tread where I was rushing in. â€¦",2011,Southwest Journal of Linguistics
Spatial Filter Selection with LASSO for EEG Classification,"Spatial filtering is an important step of preprocessing for electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Extreme energy ratio (EER) is a recently proposed method to learn spatial filters for EEG classification. It selects several eigenvectors from top and end of the eigenvalue spectrum resulting from a spectral decomposition to construct a group of spatial filters as a filter bank. However, that strategy has some limitations and the spatial filters in the group are often selected improperly. Therefore the energy features filtered by the filter bank do not contain enough discriminative information or severely overfit on small training samples. This paper utilize one of the penalized feature selection strategies called LASSO to aid us to construct the spatial filter bank termed LASSO spatial filter bank. It can learn a better selection of the spatial filters. Then two different classification methods are presented to evaluate our LASSO spatial filter bank. Their excellent performances demonstrate the stronger generalization ability of the LASSO spatial filter bank, as shown by the experimental results.",2010,
Learning Adaptive Discriminative Correlation Filters via Temporal Consistency Preserving Spatial Feature Selection for Robust Visual Object Tracking,"With efficient appearance learning models, discriminative correlation filter (DCF) has been proven to be very successful in recent video object tracking benchmarks and competitions. However, the existing DCF paradigm suffers from two major issues, i.e., spatial boundary effect and temporal filter degradation. To mitigate these challenges, we propose a new DCF-based tracking method. The key innovations of the proposed method include adaptive spatial feature selection and temporal consistent constraints, with which the new tracker enables joint spatial-temporal filter learning in a lower dimensional discriminative manifold. More specifically, we apply structured spatial sparsity constraints to multi-channel filters. Consequently, the process of learning spatial filters can be approximated by the lasso regularization. To encourage temporal consistency, the filter model is restricted to lie around its historical value and updated locally to preserve the global structure in the manifold. Last, a unified optimization framework is proposed to jointly select temporal consistency preserving spatial features and learn discriminative filters with the augmented Lagrangian method. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations have been conducted on a number of well-known benchmarking datasets such as OTB2013, OTB50, OTB100, Temple-Colour, UAV123, and VOT2018. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art approaches.",2019,IEEE Transactions on Image Processing
"Prehistoric Shellfish Exploitation Around the Goleta Lagoon, California","The reconstruction and interpretation of prehistoric subsistence has been a focus of Santa Barbara-area archaeology for many years, and the analysis of faunal remains is an integral part of this research. Shellfish remains are an abundant and visible constituent of local sites. The role of shellfish in subsistence, and their relative contribution to the prehistoric diet, have been topics of recent literature (Erlandson 1988a; Glassow and Wilcoxon 1988). To understand the role of shellfish in the prehistoric diet, it is necessary to document the nature of shellfish remains in archaeological sites. In recent years a large body of quantified data on shellfish from several sites in the vicinity of the Goleta Lagoon has been recovered, and it is now possible to consider the nature and causes of changes through time in shellfish remains in a broad context. This paper is a description of shellfish assemblages from 14 site components from 11 sites, and a discussion of explanations for changes through time in shellfish exploitation.",1989,Journal of California and Great Basin Anthropology
Accuracy Guarantees for â„“1-Recovery,"We discuss two new methods of recovery of sparse signals from noisy observation based on l1-minimization. While they are closely related to the well-known techniques such as Lasso and Dantzig Selector, these estimators come with efficiently verifiable guaranties of performance. By optimizing these bounds with respect to the method parameters we are able to construct the estimators which possess better statistical properties than the commonly used ones. We link our performance estimations to the well known results of Compressive Sensing and justify our proposed approach with an oracle inequality which links the properties of the recovery algorithms and the best estimation performance when the signal support is known. We also show how the estimates can be computed using the Non-Euclidean Basis Pursuit algorithm.",2011,IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory

Study upon the possible influence of animal burrows on the failure of the levee of San Matteo along the Secchia river,"Animal burrowing can be a main cause of initiation thereby be a cause of breaching of flood defences. However, little guidance and literature is available on this subject. This Master Thesis investigates the contribution of badgers, porcupines and foxes to the failure of the levee of San Matteo (Modena, Italy) on 19th January 2014. Firstly, the study is initiated with literature research on the Investigative Evaluation Report (â€œRelazione tecnico-scientifica sulle cause del collasso dellâ€™argine del fiume Secchia avvenuto il giorno 19 gennaio 2014 presso la frazione San Matteoâ€) which analyses the breach and presents data that will be used in the following analyses. Second, the thesis investigates the properties, geometry and distribution of animal burrows, in order to draw networks for the analyses. Finally, the literature review focuses on possible failure mechanisms caused by animal burrowing and historical cases. The assumed method evaluates first the influence of animal burrows on the water pressures in the embankment during rainfall and a high water tide. The influence of the burrowing is assessed through a transient FEM flow analysis. Starting from the documented entrances situated in the vadose zone, different scenarios for the internal distribution of tunnels and chambers are proposed. The analysis is carried out with the software PLAXIS 2D and 3D. Finally, the most likely failure mechanism and representative network for the stability of the dike is assessed. Indications around the influence of animal burrowing for the safety of a levee are stated and recommendations on their analysis in future cases are presented.",2015,
"Calibration free, user-independent gaze estimation with tensor analysis","Abstract Human gaze directly signals visual attention, therefore, estimation of gaze has been an important research topic in fields such as human attention modeling and human-computer interaction. Accurate gaze estimation requires user, system and even session dependent parameters, which can be obtained by calibration process. However, this process has to be repeated whenever the parameter changes (head movement, camera movement, monitor movement). This study aims to eliminate the calibration process of gaze estimation by building a user-independent, appearance-based gaze estimation model. The system is ideal for multimodal interfaces, where the gaze is tracked without the cooperation from the users. The main goal is to capture the essential representation of the gaze appearance of the target user. We investigate the tensor analysis framework that decomposes the high dimension gaze data into different factors including individual differences, gaze differences, user-screen distances and session differences. The axis that is representative for a particular subject is automatically chosen in the tensor analysis framework using LASSO regression. The proposed approaches show promising results on capturing the test subject gaze changes. To address the estimation shift caused by the variations in individual heights, or relative position to the monitor, we apply domain adaptation to adjust the gaze estimation, observing further improvements. These promising results suggest that the proposed gaze estimation approach is a feasible and flexible scheme to facilitate gaze-based multimodal interfaces.",2018,Image Vis. Comput.
Classification of EEG Features for Prediction of Working Memory Load,"The objective of this research was to compare classification methods aimed at predicting working memory (WM) load. Electroencephalogram (EEG) data was collected from physicians while performing basic WM tasks and simulated medical scenarios. Data processing was performed to remove noise from the signal used for analysis (e.g., muscle activity, eye-blinks). The data from basic WM tasks was used to develop and test the four classification models (LASSO regression, support vector machines (SVM), nearest shrunken centroids (NSC), and iterated supervised principal components (ISPC) to predict a WM state indicative of physiciansâ€™ optimal performance. The naive misclassification rate was 19.74 %; LASSO and SVM outperformed this threshold: 18.10 and 12.21 % respectively). Both classification models had relatively high-specificity (LASSO: 97.2 %; SVM: 99.8 %); but relatively low-sensitivity LASSO: 20.7 %; SVM: 39.6 %). Results from simulated medical scenarios suggest that physicians were approximately 83 % of the time in the WM state that is likely indicative of optimal performance.",2017,

Microarray Gene Expression Data with Linked Survival Phenotypes: Diffuse Large-B-Cell Lymphoma Revisited - eScholarship,"Diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an aggressive malignancy of mature B lymphocytes and is the most common type of lymphoma in adults. While treatment advances have been substantial in what was formerly a fatal disease, less than 50% of patients achieve lasting remission. In an effort to predict treatment success and explain disease heterogeneity clinical features have been employed for prognostic purposes, but have yielded only modest predictive performance. This has spawned a series of high profile microarray-based gene expression studies of DLBCL, in the hope that molecular level information could be used to refine prognosis. The intent of this paper is to reevaluate these microarray-based prognostic assessments, and extend the statistical methodology that has been used in this context. Methodological challenges arise in using patientsâ€™ gene expression profiles to predict survival endpoints on account of the large number of genes and their complex interdependence. We initially focus on the Lymphochip data and analysis of Rosenwald et al., (2002). After describing relationships between the analyses performed and gene harvesting (Hastie et al., 2001), we argue for the utility of penalized approaches, in particular LARS-Lasso (Efron et al., 2004). While these techniques have been extended to the proportional hazards / partial likelihood framework, the resultant algorithms are computationally burdensome. We develop residualbased approximations that eliminate this burden yet perform similarly. Comparisons of predictive accuracy across both methods and studies are effected using time-dependent ROC curves. These indicate that gene expression data, in turn, only delivers modest predictions of post therapy DLBCL survival. We conclude by outlining possibilities for further work.",2005,
"Walking activity during ambulant cardiac rehabilitation is related to maximum working capacity, age, and smoking behavior","Background
A total of 6,500 to 8,000 steps per day are recommended for cardiovascular secondary prevention. The aim of this research was to examine how many steps per day patients achieve during ambulant cardiac rehabilitation (CR), and if there is a correlation between the number of steps and physical and cardiological parameters.


Methods
In all, 192 stable CR patients were included and advised for sealed pedometry. The assessed parameters included maximum working capacity and heart rate, body mass index (BMI), New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, ejection fraction (EF), coronary artery disease status, beta-blocker medication, age, sex, smoking behavior, and laboratory parameters. A regularized regression approach called least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) was used to detect a small set of explanatory variables associated with the response for steps per day. Based on these selected covariates, a sparse additive regression model was fitted.


Results
The model noted that steps per day had a strong positive correlation with maximum working capacity (P=0.001), a significant negative correlation with higher age (P=0.01) and smoking (smoker: P<0.05; ex-smoker: P=0.01), a positive correlation with high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and a negative correlation with beta-blockers. Correlation between BMI and walking activity was nonlinear (BMI 18.5-24: 7,427Â±2,730 steps per day; BMI 25-29: 6,448Â±2,393 steps/day; BMI 30-34: 6,751Â±2,393 steps per day; BMI 35-39: 5,163Â±2,574; BMI >40: 6,077Â±1,567).


Conclusion
Walking activity during CR is reduced in patients who are unfit, older, smoke, or used to smoke. In addition to training recommendations, estimated steps per day during CR could be seen as a baseline orientation that helps patients to stay generally active or even to increase activity after CR.",2018,Vascular Health and Risk Management

Dynamique des rÃ©seaux sociaux et trajectoire dâ€™entreprises informelles Ã  Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina Faso),"Dynamics of Social Networks and Trajectories of Informal Businesses in Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina Faso): This paper analyzes the evolution/transformation of social relations and networks for access to resources during the career of micro entrepreneurs in an informal urban economy in Sub-Saharan Africa. From a methodological point of view, the analysis of life histories from micro and small entrepreneurs in Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina Faso) was done by combining different forms of qualitative and quantitative analysis (Grossetti and Barthe, 2008). This novel method can identify the characteristics of the joint evolution of the business activity and the entrepreneurâ€™s social network, and then provide a comprehensive analysis of the processes underlying these dynamics. It appears that the gradual professionalization and institutionalization of the social network of the entrepreneur are forms of securing access to resources promoting the development of the economic activity.",2011,
Identification and validation of a 21-mRNA prognostic signature in diffuse lower-grade gliomas,"PurposeDiffuse low-grade and intermediate-grade gliomas, also known as lower-grade gliomas (LGGs), are a class of central nervous system tumors. Overall survival varies greatly between patients, highlighting the importance of evaluating exact outcomes to facilitate individualized clinical management. We aimed to identify an mRNA-based prognostic signature to predict the survival of patients with LGGs.MethodsA total of 874 LGGs from two public datasets were included. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression was used to select the most prognostic mRNAs and build a risk score. A nomogram incorporating the risk score and clinical factors was established for individualized survival prediction. The performance of the nomogram was assessed in the training set (329 patients), internal validation set (140 patients), and external validation set (405 patients).Results21 most prognostic mRNAs remained following the LASSO Cox regression. The 21-mRNA signature successfully stratified patients into high- and low-risk groups (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001 for all datasets in Kaplanâ€“Meier analysis). Subsequent gene set enrichment analysis identified 19 essential biological processes in high-risk LGGs. Furthermore, a nomogram incorporating the risk score, age, grade, and 1p/19q status was developed with favorable calibration and high predictive accuracy in the training set and validation sets (C-index: 0.877, 0.878, and 0.812, respectively).ConclusionThe 21-mRNA signature has reliable prognostic value for LGGs and might facilitate the effective stratification and individualized management of patients.",2019,Journal of Neuro-Oncology
Sparse latent factor regression models for genome-wide and epigenome-wide association studies,"Association of phenotypes or exposures with genomic and epigenomic data faces important statistical challenges. One of these challenges is to remove variation due to unobserved confounding factors, such as individual ancestry or cell-type composition in tissues. This issue can be addressed with penalized latent factor regression models, where penalties are introduced to cope with high dimension in the data. If a relatively small proportion of genomic or epigenomic markers correlate with the variable of interest, sparsity penalties may help to capture the relevant associations, but the improvement over non-sparse approaches has not been fully evaluated yet. In this study, we introduced least-squares algorithms that jointly estimate effect sizes and confounding factors in sparse latent factor regression models. Computer simulations provided evidence that sparse latent factor regression models achieve higher statistical performance than other sparse methods, including the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and a Bayesian sparse linear mixed model (BSLMM). Additional simulations based on real data showed that sparse latent factor regression models were more robust to departure from the generative model than non-sparse approaches, such as surrogate variable analysis (SVA) and other methods. We applied sparse latent factor regression models to a genome-wide association study of a flowering trait for the plant Arabidopsis thaliana and to an epigenome-wide association study of smoking status in pregnant women. For both applications, sparse latent factor regression models facilitated the estimation of non-null effect sizes while avoiding multiple testing problems. The results were not only consistent with previous discoveries, but they also pinpointed new genes with functional annotations relevant to each application.",2020,bioRxiv
Identifying the Driving Factors of Black Bloom in Lake Bay through Bayesian LASSO,"Black blooms are a serious and complex problem for lake bays, with far-reaching implications for water quality and drinking safety. While Fe(II) and S(-II) have been reported as the most important triggers of this phenomenon, little effort has been devoted in investigating the relationships between Fe(II) and S(-II) and the host of potentially important aquatic factors. However, a model involving many putative predictors and their interactions will be oversaturated and ill-defined, making ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation unfeasible. In such a case, sparsity assumption is typically required to exclude the redundant predictors from the model, either through variable selection or regularization. In this study, Bayesian least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was employed to identify the major influence variables from 11 aquatic factors for Fe(II), S(-II), and suspended sediment concentration (SSC) in the Chaohu Lake (Eastern of China) bay during black bloom maintenance. Both the main effects and the interactions between these factors were studied. The method successfully screened the most important variables from many items. The determination coefficients (R2) and adjusted determination coefficients (Adjust R2) showed that all regression equations for Fe(II), S(-II), and SSC were in good agreement with the situation observed in the Chaohu Lake. The outcome of correlation and LASSO regression indicated that total phosphorus (TP) was the single most important factor for Fe(II), S(-II), and SSC in black bloom with explanation ratios (ERs) of 76.1%, 37.0%, and 12.9%, respectively. The regression results showed that the interaction items previously deemed negligible have significant effects on Fe(II), S(-II), and SSC. For the Fe(II) equation, total nitrogen (TN) Ã— dissolved oxygen (DO) and chlorophyll a (CHLA) Ã— oxidation reduction potential (ORP), which contributed 10.6% and 13.3% ERs, respectively, were important interaction variables. TP emerged in each key interaction item of the regression equation for S(-II). Water depth (DEP) Ã— Fe(II) (30.7% ER) was not only the main interaction item, but DEP (5.6% ER) was also an important single factor for the SSC regression equation. It also indicated that the sediment in shallow bay is an important source for SSC in water. The uncertainty of these relationships was also estimated by the posterior distribution and coefficient of variation (CV) of these items. Overall, our results suggest that TP concentration is the most important driver of black blooms in a lake bay, whereas the other factors, such as DO, DEP, and CHLA act in concert with other aquatic factors. There results provide a basis for the further control and management policy development of black blooms.",2019,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health

Teamwork: Improved eQTL Mapping Using Combinations of Machine Learning Methods,"Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping is a widely used technique to uncover regulatory relationships between genes. A range of methodologies have been developed to map links between expression traits and genotypes. The DREAM (Dialogue on Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods) initiative is a community project to objectively assess the relative performance of different computational approaches for solving specific systems biology problems. The goal of one of the DREAM5 challenges was to reverse-engineer genetic interaction networks from synthetic genetic variation and gene expression data, which simulates the problem of eQTL mapping. In this framework, we proposed an approach whose originality resides in the use of a combination of existing machine learning algorithms (committee). Although it was not the best performer, this method was by far the most precise on average. After the competition, we continued in this direction by evaluating other committees using the DREAM5 data and developed a method that relies on Random Forests and LASSO. It achieved a much higher average precision than the DREAM best performer at the cost of slightly lower average sensitivity.",2012,PLoS ONE
065 Atrial fibrillation ablation in a district general hospital: 3 years experience,"Introduction The practice of atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation is increasing exponentially. At present, these procedures are performed in a small number of surgical tertiary centres. In order to meet the growing demand it will be necessary to expand this service. We sought to assess patient satisfaction, procedural success and complication rates for AF ablation performed via a newly established district general hospital (DGH) service. Methods We prospectively surveyed patients undergoing AF ablation, between November 2007 and November 2010, at Eastbourne DGH. Patient symptoms were assessed before and at least 12â€…months after AF ablation by telephone questionnaire, procedural satisfaction was also assessed. Procedural details (procedural time, fluoroscopy time, ablation technique) and complications were all accurately recorded for every case. Results In 278 patients 314 procedures (average 1.13 procedures/pt) were performed (160 for persistent AF [PersAF], 134 for paroxysmal AF [PAF]). Mean age 63.8Â±10.7â€…years, 70% male. Of the PAF cases 75 procedures were performed with the PVAC (Medtronic, USA) and 56 with the Mesh (Bard, USA) catheter. The remaining three PAF procedures were performed with LASSO, Artic front cyroablation balloon and the Amigo robot (Catheter Robotics, Inc.) and weren9t used in the analysis. Mean procedural time was 107.9Â±35.9â€…min, fluroscopy time was 32.1Â±11.3â€…min. Both measures were significantly shorter in the PVAC PAF group (p Conclusion Our 3â€…year experience shows that AF ablation can be safely performed in a DGH settings with high procedural success rates and low complication rates. There was no need for acute surgical intervention in any of our cases.",2012,Heart
Atrial fibrillation resistant to electrical cardioversion.,"A 37-year-old man with a 15-year history of symptomatic, drugrefractory paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) was referred to our hospital for AF ablation [1â€“4]. He had no structural heart disease, and the echocardiographic parameters were normal. The procedure was performed under conscious sedation. A 7-F 14 pole two site mapping catheter (Irvine Biomedical Inc., Irvine, CA, USA) was inserted through the right jugular vein and positioned in the coronary sinus for pacing, recording and internal cardioversion. Upon arrival, the patient was in sinus rhythm, but AF was easily induced by burst pacing from the right atrium. We performed several attempts of cardioversion (maximal external cardioversion delivery of 360 J, and maximal internal cardioversion delivery of 10 J) to find the triggers that initiated the AF, however it failed to convert the AF to sinus rhythm. Following pulmonary vein (PV) angiography (Fig. 1A), two circular mapping catheters (Lasso, Biosense Webster, Diamond Bar, CA, USA) were placed in the superior and inferior PVs, respectively, and PV mapping was performed (Fig. 1B). The left PVs were active, and the potentials were fractionatedwith themean cycle length in the left PVs being very short (60â€“100 ms). The potentials in the right PVs were organized and the cycle length was longer than that in the left PVs. During ongoing AF, the left-sided ipsilateral PVs, including their antrum, were circumferentially ablated and isolated simultaneously under fluoroscopic and electrophysiologic guidancewith an 8-mm-tip ablation catheter (Japan Lifeline Inc., Tokyo, Japan) while monitoring the esophageal temperature (Fig. 1A and B). Following the isolation of the left PVs, the AF was easily converted to sinus rhythm with a 10 J",2011,International journal of cardiology
Die Verdampfung der BrÃ¼hen,"Die modernen Gerbmethoden erfordern starke Bruhen, sogar solche bis zu 24Â° Be.

Degrees of freedom in submodular regularization: A computational perspective of Stein's unbiased risk estimate,"Abstract Degrees of freedom is a covariance penalty related to penalized model selection procedures such as Mallowsâ€™ C p and AIC. We study the degrees of freedom of two polyhedral convex regularization classes defined through submodular functions called the Lovasz extension regularization and submodular norm regularization. It has been pointed out that submodular regularization contains many existing penalties that induce structural sparsity. In this paper, we show that the degrees of freedom of submodular regularization estimators can be represented in terms of partitions induced by the estimators. Our formula does not depend on the choice of the design matrix and the penalty function. Moreover, if the design matrix has full column rank, calculating an unbiased estimator of the degrees of freedom requires an additional computational cost of only O ( p log p ) after a solution for the estimator is obtained, where p is the dimension of the parameter. Existing results for some regularization and projection type estimators, such as the lasso, the fused lasso, and the isotonic regression, are also recovered.",2020,J. Multivar. Anal.
Towards Accurate Predictions of Customer Purchasing Patterns,"A range of algorithms was used to classify online retail customers of a UK company using historical transaction data. The predictive capabilities of the classifiers were assessed using linear regression, Lasso and regression trees. Unlike most related studies, classifications were based upon specific and marketing focused customer behaviours. Prediction accuracy on untrained customers was generally better than 80%. The models implemented (and compared) for classification were: Logistic Regression, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, Linear SVM, RBF SVM, Gaussian Process, Decision Tree, Random Forest and Multi-layer Perceptron (Neural Network). Postcode data was then used to classify solely on demographics derived from the UK Land Registry and similar public data sources. Prediction accuracy remained better than 60%.",2017,2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (CIT)
Sparse principal component analysis with measurement errors,"Abstract Traditional principal component analysis often produces non-zero loadings, which makes it hard to interpret the principal components. This drawback can be overcome by the sparse principal component analysis procedures developed in the past decade. However, similar work has not been done when the random variables or vectors are contaminated with measurement errors. Simply applying the existing sparse principal component analysis procedure to the error-contaminated data might lead to biased loadings. This paper tries to modify an existing sparse principal component procedure to accommodate the measurement error setup. Similar to error-free cases, we show that the sparse principal component for the latent variables can be formulated as a bias-corrected lasso (elastic net) regression problem based on the observed surrogates, efficient algorithms are also developed to implement the procedure. Numerical simulation studies are conducted to illustrate the finite sample performance of the proposed method.",2016,Journal of Statistical Planning and Inference

Abstract 17621: VisiTag as a New Promising Index of Optimal Lesion Formation During Atrial Fibrillation Ablation with Adequate Contact Force,"Backgrounds: Contact force (CF) information is effective in accomplishing circumferential pulmonary vein (PV) isolation (CPVI). However, residual conduction gap still remains despite ablation with optimal CF in some patients. Objective: Using a VisiTag module, we examined the influence of catheter position stability during CPVI to the residual conduction gap. Methods: The consecutive 131 patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) (85 men; mean age, 63 years; paroxysmal AF, 101) undergoing CPVI using a Thermcool Smarttouch catheter were enrolled. CPVI was performed with target CF at 10-20 g and power at 25-30W without monitoring PV potentials. PV potentials were recorded with a lasso catheter before and after CPVI. In the initial 62, CPVI was performed only with CF information (CF group). In the other 69, it was performed using a VisiTag module installed on CARTO3 Version 3, in which force time index (FTI) was predetermined while setting filter thresholds at 5 seconds for the minimum time, 1 mm for the maximum...",2014,Circulation
"Seroepidemiology of Toxoplasma gondii infection among slaughtered pigs, cattle and goats for human consumption in Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso","Toxoplasmosis is a major foodborne infectious disease with substantial adverse impact on population health and economy. Human infection is usually secondary to the consumption of contaminated raw or undercooked meat. Recent studies have reported a high prevalence of the infection in slaughterhouse animals in sub-Saharan Africa but few data exist for Burkina Faso. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of Toxoplasma gondii infection in animal from Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso. A total of 962 animal (including 423 pigs, 197 cattle and 342 goats) blood samples were collected in slaughterhouses in Bobo-Dioulasso between August 2013 and May 2014. Serum samples were tested for T. gondii antibody detection using the modified agglutination test (MAT). The overall seroprevalence of T. gondii was 28.8% in pigs, 13.2% in cattle and 34.8% in goats. Females animals were more infected than males. More than 60% of older animals (higher than 5 year-old animals) were infected. The study reported a high seroprevalence of T. gondii infection in pigs, cattle, and goats in Bobo-Dioulasso and is, therefore, of public health concern. The consumption of raw or undercooked meat should be regarded as an important risk factor for T. gondii infection in the study area. However further studies are needed to design appropriate control measures.

Column Partition based Distributed Algorithms for Coupled Convex Sparse Optimization: Dual and Exact Regularization Approaches.,"This paper develops column partition based distributed schemes for a class of large-scale convex sparse optimization problems, e.g., basis pursuit (BP), LASSO, basis pursuit denosing (BPDN), and their extensions, e.g., fused LASSO. We are particularly interested in the cases where the number of (scalar) decision variables is much larger than the number of (scalar) measurements, and each agent has limited memory or computing capacity such that it only knows a small number of columns of a measurement matrix. These problems in consideration are densely coupled and cannot be formulated as separable convex programs using column partition. To overcome this difficulty, we consider their dual problems which are separable or locally coupled. Once a dual solution is attained, it is shown that a primal solution can be found from the dual of corresponding regularized BP-like problems under suitable exact regularization conditions. A wide range of existing distributed schemes can be exploited to solve the obtained dual problems. This yields two-stage column partition based distributed schemes for LASSO-like and BPDN-like problems; the overall convergence of these schemes is established using sensitivity analysis techniques. Numerical results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.",2020,arXiv: Optimization and Control
Design of a resonant gravitational-wave detector with quantum-limited sensitivity,"SummaryIt is shown that aresonant transducer is indispensable in a wide range of experimental conditions in order to accomplish optimum matching between a cryogenic antenna and a low-noise amplifier. Noise characteristics of a d.c. SQUID are analyzed and an improved design of a point contact d.c. SQUID is described. Conditions for transducer matching and detectability of a gravitational-wave signal are derived for a system employing a d.c. SQUID. It appears that a d.c. SQUID operating at the quantum-limited sensitivity could be realized in our proposed design and matched to a massive aluminum antenna cooled to 0.05 K by using a resonant superconducting inductive transducer. Presently achievable detector parameters are shown to be sufficient to allow a detection sensitivity corresponding to a resolution of a few photons in the antenna, the ultimate quantum-mechanical limit derived for an antenna instrumented with a linear-motion detector.RiassuntoSi mostra che un trasduttore un trasduttore risonante Ã¨ indispensabile in un ampio lasso di condizioni sperimentali allo scopo di ottenere condizioni operative ottimali tra unâ€™antenna criogenica e un amplificatore a basso disturbo.

Novel Resampling Methods for Tuning Parameter Selection in Robust Sparse Regression Modeling,"The robust lasso-type regularized regression is a useful tool for simultaneous estimation and variable selection even in the presence of outliers. Crucial issues in the robust modeling procedure include the selection of regularization parameters and also a tuning constant in outlier detection. Although the performance of the robust sparse regression strongly depends on the proper choice of these tuning parameters, little attention was paid for this issue, particularly in the presence of outliers. We consider the problem of choosing the tuning parameters and propose an information-theoretic criterion based on the bootstrap. Although the bootstrap information criterion has several advantages on its flexibility and weak assumptions, a bootstrap sample may contain more outliers compared with those included in the original sample, since the bootstrap sample is drawn randomly. This implies that the bootstrap information criterion may be obtained from the highly contaminated bootstrap sample by outliers, so the resulting criterion may produce biased results. In order to overcome the drawback, we propose a robust bootstrap information criterion via winsorizing technique (Srivastava et al., 2010) in line with the efficient bootstrap information criterion (Konishi and Kitagawa, 1996) for choosing an optimal set of tuning parameters. Monte Carlo simulations and real data analysis are conducted to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

These rocks are composed essentially of microcline (up to 1.1 wt.% Na2O and 1.0 wt.% BaO), altered nepheline (replaced by analcime, zeolites, muscovite and gibbsite), and prismatic aegirine set in an aggregate of fibrous and radial aegirine. The early accessory assemblage includes Mg-Fe mica, rutile, zircon, titaniferous magnetite and thorite. Precipitation of these phases was followed by crystallization of a plethora of rare minerals enriched in Sr, Ba, light REE and Nb. Three major stages are distinguished in the evolution of this mineralization: primary, agpaitic and deuteric. Primary repositories for Sr, REE and Nb included betafite, loparite-(Ce), crichtonite and ilmenite-group minerals. Betafite (Ta-poor, REE- and Th-rich) is present in very minor amounts and did not contribute significantly to the sequestration of incompatible elements from the nepheline-syenite melt. Loparite-(Ce) evolved predominantly by depletion in Sr and Ca and enrichment in Nb, Na and REE, i.e. from strontian niobian loparite (up to 22.0 wt.% SrO) to niobian loparite (up to 17.6 wt.% Nb2O5). Crichtonite contains minor Na, Ca and K, lacks detectable Ba and REE, and is unusually enriched in Mn (7.0â€“13.6 wt.% MnO). The ilmenite-group minerals evolved from manganoan ilmenite to ferroan pyrophanite, and have relatively low Nb contents (â‰¤ 0.9 wt.% Nb2O5). During the agpaitic stage, the major repositories for incompatible elements were silicates, including lamprophyllite, titanite and chevkinite-group minerals. Lamprophyllite is generally poor in Ba, and contains relatively minor Ca and K; only few small crystals exhibit rims of barytolamprophyllite with up to 26.3 wt.% BaO. Titanite is devoid of Al and depleted in Fe, but significantly enriched in Nb, Sr, REE and Na: up to 6.4, 4.5, 4.4. and 2.9 wt.% oxides, respectively. The chemical complexity of titanite suggests involvement of several substitution mechanisms: Ca2++Ti4+â‡Na1++Nb5+, Ca2 â‡Sr2+, 2Ca2+â‡Na1++REE3+, and Ca t++OZ-~--Nal+ + (OH)1âˆ’. Chevkinite group minerals evolved from Sr-rich (strontiochevkinite) to REE-rich compositions [chevkinite-(Ce)]. Strontiochevkinite from Pegmatite Peak is compositionally similar to the type material from Sarambi, and has high ZrO2 (up to 7.8 wt.%) and low FeOT (â‰¤ 2.5 wt.%) contents. During the final stages of formation of the pegmatites, a deuteric F-bearing fluid enriched in Sr and REE precipitated carbonates and minor phosphates confined to fractures and cavities in the rock. In this youngest assemblage of minerals, ancylite-(Ce) is the most common Sr-REE host. Some discrete crystals of ancylite show significant enrichment in Th (up to 6.0 wt.% ThO2). Ancylite-(Ce) and bastnaesite associated with â€œmetalopariteâ€ and TiO2 (anatase?) comprise a replacement assemblage after primary loparite. The typical replacement pattern includes a loparite core with locally developed â€œmetalopariteâ€, surrounded by a bastnaesite-anatase intermediate zone and an ancylite rim. Fluorapatite is rare, and has very high Sr, Na and REE contents, up to 21.4, 2.6 and 12.9 wt.% oxides, respectively. Compositionally, this mineral corresponds to the solid solution series between fluorapatite and belovite-(Ce). At this stage, hollandite-group minerals became a minor host for Ba; they demonstrate the evolutionary trend from priderite (5.2 wt. % K2O, 7.4 wt. % BaO) to Ba-Fe hollandite (19.2â€“21.4 wt. % BaO). Thus, the evolution of Sr, REE, Ba and Nb mineralization was a complex, multi-stage process, and involved primary crystallization, re-equilibration phenomena and late-stage deuteric alteration.ZusammenfassungDie Pegmatite von Pegmatite Peak (Bearpaw Mts., Montana) sind aus dem Restdifferentiat einer nephelinsyenitischen Schmelze, die an Sr, Ba, leichten SEE und Nb angereichert war, auskristallisiert. Diese Gesteine bestehen hauptsÃ¤chlich aus Mikroklin (max. 1.1 Gew.% Na2O und max. 1.0 Gew.% BaO), alteriertem Nephelin (verdrÃ¤ngt durch Analcim, Zeolithe, Muscovit und Gibbsit) und prismatischem Agirin, welcher von einem Aggregat aus fasrigem und strahligem Ã„girin umgeben ist. Als frÃ¼he akzessorische Mineralien sind Mg-Fe Glimmer, Rutil, Zirkon, titanfÃ¼hrender Magnetit und Thorit auskristallisiert. AnschlieÃŸend bildete sich eine Vielzahl seltener, Sr-, Ba, leichter SEE- und Nb-reicher Mineralien aus. In den Proben von Pegmatite Peak sind drei Hauptphasen in der Entwicklung der akzessorischen Sr-, Ba-, SEE- und Nb-Mineralisation zu unterscheiden: eine primÃ¤re, eine agpaitische und eine deuterische. PrimÃ¤r wurden Sr, SEE und Nb in Betafit, Loparit-(Ce), Crichtonit und Mineralien der Ilmenitgruppe eingebaut. Betafit (Ta-arm, SEE- und Th-reich) ist ein sehr seltenes Mineral in den Pegmatiten, und hat die inkompatiblen Elemente nur unbedeutend konzentriert. Loparit-(Ce) entsteht im wesentlichen durch den Austausch von Sr und Ca durch Nb, Na und SEE; d.h. durch Umwandlung von strontium- und niobhÃ¤ltigem Loparit (â‰¤ 22.0 Gew.% SrO) zu niobhÃ¤ltigem Loparit (â‰¤ 17.6 Gew.% Nb2O5). Crichtonit enthÃ¤lt eine geringe Menge Na, Ca und K, ist ohne feststellbare SEE und Ba und ist gewÃ¶nlich Mn-reich (7.0-13.6 Gew.% MnO). Mineralien der Ilmenitgruppe entwickeln sich von manganfiihrendem Ilmenit hin zu eisenfÃ¼hrendem Pyrophanit und haben relativ niedrige Nb-Gehalte (â‰¤ 0.9 Gew.% Nb2O5). WÃ¤hrend der agpaitischen Phase waren Silikate wie Lamprophyllit, Titanit und Mineralien der Tscheffkinitgruppe die wichtigsten TrÃ¤ger von inkompatiblen Elementen. Lamprophyllit ist generell Ba-arm und ist durch relativ niedrige Ca- und K-Gehalte charakterisiert. Nur wenige kleine Kristalle zeigen barytolamprophyllitische RÃ¤nder (< 26.3 Gew.% BaO). Fe ist im Titanit (Al-frei) abgereichert wÃ¤hrend Nb, Sr, SEE und Na (jeweils max. 6.4, 4.5, 4.4 und 2.9 Gew.% Oxid) angereichert wurden. Die chemische Zusammensetzung des Titanits kann durch mehrere Substituierungen erklÃ¤rt werden: Ca l++Ti4+~Nal+-I-Nbs+, Ca2+ â‡ Sr2+, 2Ca2+ â‡Na1++REE3+, und Ca2+ +O2âˆ’ â‡Na1+ +(OH)1âˆ’. Mineralien der Tscheffkinitgruppe entwickeln sich aus Sr-reichen (Strontiotscheffkinit) hin zu SEE-reichen Gliedern [Tscheffkinit-(Ce)]. Strontiotscheffkinit von Pegmatite Peak mit hohem ZrO2-(< 7.8 Gew.%) und niedrigem FeOT-Gehalt (< 2.5 Gew.%) hat eine Ã¤hnliche Zusammensetzung wie der Holotyp von Sarambi. WÃ¤hrend der letzten Phasen der Bildung der Pegmatite brachte ein deuterisches, F-haltiges, Sr- und SEE-reiches Fluid Karbonate und in geringer Mengen Phosphate in Spalten und HohlrÃ¤umen im Gestein zur AusfÃ¤llung. Ankylit-(Ce) ist das hÃ¤ufigste Sr- und SEE-fÃ¼hrende Mineral dieser jÃ¼ngsten Mineralassoziation. Manche einzelne Ankylitkristalle zeigen eine bedeutende Anreicherung von Th (< 6.0 Gew.% ThO2). Ankylit, BastnÃ¤sit, â€œMetaloparitâ€ und TiO2 (Anatas?) ersetzten den ursprÃ¼nglichen Loparit. Typische VerdrÃ¤ngungen zeigen sich als KÃ¶rner mit loparitischen Kernen, welche Ã¶rtlich mit â€œMetaloparitâ€ verwachsen sind, weiters einer BastnÃ¤sit-Anatas Zwischenzone und einem ankylitischen Rand. Fluorapatit ist hier ein seltenes Mineral und hat sehr hohe Sr-, Na- und SEE-Gehalte (jeweils 21.4, 2.6 und 12.9 Gew.% Oxid). Von der chemischen Zusammensetzung aus gesehen gehÃ¶rt dieses Mineral zur Fluoapatit-Belovit-(Ce)-Mischkristallreiche. WÃ¤hrend der deuterischen Phase dienten die Mineralien der Hollanditgruppe untergeordnet als TrÃ¤ger fÃ¼r Ba; sie legen die Entwicklung von Priderit (5.2 Gew.% K20, 7.4 Gew.% BaO) zu Ba-Fe-Hollandit (19.2â€“21.4 Gew.% BaO). Somit ist die Entwicklung der Sr-, SEE-, Ba- und Nb-Mineralisation ein komplexer mehrphasiger ProzeÃŸ und umfaÃŸt die primÃ¤re Kristallisation, ReÃ¤quilibrierungsphÃ¤nomene und eine spÃ¤te deuterische Alteration.",1999,Mineralogy and Petrology
Prognostic nomogram incorporating inflammatory cytokines for overall survival in patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,"BACKGROUND
This study aimed to investigate the association of pre-treatment inflammatory status with survival time and to develop a prognostic nomogram incorporating inflammatory cytokines in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.


METHODS
A total of 228 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) received R-CHOP-based regimens from a prospective randomized study (NCT01852435) were included as a training cohort. Other cohorts of 886 lymphoma patients were served as validation cohorts. Lymphocyte-monocyte ratio (LMR), serum levels of soluble interleukin s(IL)-2R, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±), were assessed before treatment. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression were used to select variables for nomogram of overall survival (OS). The predictive accuracy of the nomogram was determined by concordance index (C-index).


FINDINGS
The nomogram included lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), sIL-2R, TNF-Î± and decreased LMR. The C-index of the nomogram for OS prediction were range from 0.61 to 0.86 for training cohort of DLBCL and validation cohorts of DLBCL, PTCL, NKTCL and ASCT, which were superior to the predictive power of International Prognostic Index (IPI, 0.67 to 0.84) or NCCN-IPI (0.59 to 0.78), but not in those of indolent lymphoma like FL and MALT.


INTERPRETATIONS
The nomogram incorporating inflammatory cytokines provides a useful tool for risk stratification in aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.

Resulting fromSmagorinsky's theory is a relation between the latitude of the subtropical anticyclonic belt and the two last-mentioned parameters. On the base of this diagram and assuming thalassocratic conditions, a numerical estimate of the climatic belts is given during the long warm periods of the earth's history, especially from mesozoic to early tertiary.",1964,Geologische Rundschau
Multivariate Pairs Trading Using Temporal Dependence Structures,"Multivariate pairs trading is a strategy that tries to exploit inefficiencies in the relative value pricing between stocks and baskets of related assets. In this research we set up such strategies, where the baskets are identified by elastic net regularization. The elastic net rigorously combines Lasso and ridge regression resulting in compact and robust baskets. We model the spread dynamics of pairs using copula-based (semi-)parametric time series models. This type of model allows for a range of dependency structures and marginals that can be modelled separately. This affords great flexibility and opens up a new way on modelling the spread dynamics. We investigate the strategiesâ€™ performance for the Japanese universe using daily stock prices of the Nikkei 225 index constituents ranging from August 3rd 2001 to April 1st 2010. We find that the generalization to account for nonlinear associations in the spread dynamics does not necessarily lead to more trading opportunities. However, this generalization leads to â€˜betterâ€™ trading signals, i.e. a higher rate of trades that converges. After optimizing the input parameters we find annualized Sharpe ratios up to 1.35 for the copula model and 0.69 for its linear counterpart. Hedging the positions by the identified baskets rather than only stocksâ€™ sector members lowers the portfoliosâ€™ standard deviations, but does not lead to significant higher Sharpe ratios.",2018,

Block sparse multi-lead ECG compression exploiting between-lead collaboration,"Multi-lead ECG compression (M-lEC) has attracted tremendous attention in long-term monitoring of the patient's heart behaviour. This study proposes a method denoted by block sparse M-lEC (BlS M-lEC) in order to exploit between-lead correlations to compress the signals in a more efficient way. This is due to the fact that multi-lead electrocardiography signals are multiple observations of the same source (heart) from different locations. Consequently, they have a high correlation in terms of the support set of their sparse models which leads them to share dominant common structure. In order to obtain the block sparse model, the collaborative version of lasso estimator is applied. In addition, it is shown that raised cosine kernel has advantages over conventional Gaussian and wavelet (Daubechies family) due to its specific properties. It is demonstrated that using raised cosine kernel in constructing the sparsifying basis matrix gives a sparser model which results in higher compression ratio and lower reconstruction error. The simulation results show the average improvement of 37, 88 and 90-97% for BlS M-lEC compared to the non-collaborative case with raised cosine kernel, Gaussian kernel and collaborative case with Daubechies wavelet kernels, respectively, in terms of reconstruction error while the compression ratio is considered fixed.",2019,IET Signal Processing

Leaching of Alachlor from Alginateâ€Encapsulated Controlledâ€Release Formulations,"The mobility of alachlor from alginate-encapsulated controlled-release (CR) formulations was investigated in two contrasting soil profiles. Two CR formulations of alachlor were prepared with the following components (1) base-sodium alginate + kaolin + 'Tween' 20Â® (1 + 10 + 0.5 by mass) and (2) base + 40 g kg -1 linseed oil. These were compared to technical grade alachlor and to a commercial alachlor EC formulation ('Lasso' 4EC). All herbicide treatments were labeled with [ 14 C]alachlor and were applied to duplicate soil columns that were composed of a surface and a subsoil horizon. Each horizon was packed to a depth of 12.5 cm, giving a total column length of 25 cm. The columns were leached with 21 cm (420 ml) to 30 cm (600 ml) of 0.01 M calcium chloride for a period of 7 to 10 days. Alachlor leaching from the EC formulations was the same as that from the technical material in both soils : 33% in the Evesboro and 10% in the Conover soil. The CR-Oil formulation leached 4 and 2% of the applied [ 14 C]alachlor, compared to 12 and 3% for the CR-N formulation for the Evesboro and Conover soils, respectively. The CR-Oil formulation also increased the amount of [ 14 C]alachlor retained in the soil surface horizon (105-114%), compared to CR-N (39-45%), technical material (14-23%) and EC (12-17%).",1996,Pesticide Science

A sparse method to handle two high dimensional symetric data sets,"When dealing with high dimensional biological data, one important issue is to handle the n << p problem, as most variables are irrelevant or noisy to explain the biological experiment. This issue is even more challenging when there are more than one group of variables and when the aim is to highlight the relationships between the different sets of variables. Here, we especially focus on the situation where there are two groups of variables measured on the same observations (symetric data sets). Very few methods can deal with two (or more) data sets. Among them, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA, [2]) and Partial Least Squares regression (PLS, [3]) can answer the biological question. However, both approaches do not allow feature selection. To deal with the major drawback of CCA (p < n and q < n), [1] proposed to regularize CCA with an L2 penalization. But so far, no sparse method has been developped yet to handle this problem, as it is proposed by lasso in the context of regression. We propose a sparse approach to select variables from each of the two data sets with two variants: either to model the relationships between the two sets of variables, or to predict one set of variables with respect to the other. We apply this method to some real world data sets with two types of measurements, and which purpose is to explain which group of variable imply the other group of variables (and/or vice versa).",2008,
"Differences in the ability of two marine annelid species, Thalassodrilides sp. and Perinereis nuntia, to detoxify 1-nitronaphthalene.","Bioremediation is a promising method for remediating environmentally polluted water. We investigated the abilities of two benthic annelid species to biotransform 1-nitronaphthalene, a nitrated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. We used an oligochaete, Thalassodrilides sp. (Naididae), collected from the sediment beneath a fish farm and a polychaete, Perinereis nuntia, which was obtained from a commercial source. Populations of both organisms were exposed to 1400Â Î¼gÂ L(-1) of 1-nitronaphthalene in seawater for 3 days in the dark at 20Â Â°C. The concentration of the pollutant decreased to 12Â Î¼gÂ L(-1) in the seawater containing the Thalassodrilides sp. and to 560Â Î¼gÂ L(-1) in the seawater containing P.Â nuntia. The 1-nitronaphthalene concentration in the bodies of the animals increased from 12 to 94Â Î¼gÂ kg(-1) in Thalassodrilides sp. and from 0.90Â Î¼gÂ kg(-1) to 38,000Â Î¼gÂ kg(-1) in P.Â nuntia. After 3 days, 99% and 40% of the 1-nitronaphthalene had been biotransformed in the Thalassodrilides sp. and P.Â nuntia experimental groups, respectively. We then tested the acute toxicity of residual 1-nitronaphthalene from the same water using mummichog (fish) larvae. After the larvae had been exposed for 96Â h, the percentage of apparently unaffected larvae remaining was 83.3% in Thalassodrilides sp. group but only 16.7% in the P.Â nuntia group. Clearly, of the two species we studied, Thalassodrilides sp. had a superior ability to convert 1-nitronaphthalene into substances that were nontoxic to mummichog larvae. Therefore, we recommend the use of this species for bioremediation of chemically polluted sediments.",2016,Chemosphere

Generational cohort effects on trends in the drug overdose mortality epidemic in the United States,"Background: Bayesian regularization can address over-parameterization of age-period-cohort (APC) mortality models, facilitated by a new methodology for comparing fits of Bayesian regularized models. Here Bayesian Lasso is used to shrink slope changes in linear spline fits of the parameters of the Lee-Carter plus cohorts APC model. This model allows trends over periods to vary by age. It is applied to overdose mortality rates from the 1999-2015 CDC WONDER data for white non-hispanic males ages 17-61. The APC identification problem is addressed by parameter constraints, not by regularization. 
Findings: For this group, observed overdose mortality rates increased most markedly for the youngest and oldest ages. Early in the period the highest rates were for ages in the mid-40s, but this had shifted to the mid-30s ages by the end. Including cohort effects increases the explanatory power of the model. The parameters as constrained attribute the increase for the younger ages to high trends in the period parameters for those ages. The older ages get lower period trend rates, with the increased mortality attributed largely to the baby boom cohorts maturing into those ages. The data show a slower increase rate for ages near 20 since 2007, and the model treats this as a cohort-effect parameter reduction for those born after 1990. 
Conclusion: Bayesian Lasso is an effective way to parameterize APC mortality trends. The inclusion of cohort effects provides an improved account of the trends in overdose mortality rates across this population, compared to a model with age and period effects only. Period trends themselves vary significantly across the age groups.",2017,Social Science Research Network
Integrated analysis reveals microRNA networks coordinately expressed with key proteins in breast cancer,"BackgroundThe role played by microRNAs in the deregulation of protein expression in breast cancer is only partly understood. To gain insight, the combined effect of microRNA and mRNA expression on protein expression was investigated in three independent data sets.MethodsProtein expression was modeled as a multilinear function of powers of mRNA and microRNA expression. The model was first applied to mRNA and protein expression for 105 selected cancer-associated genes and to genome-wide microRNA expression from 283 breast tumors. The model considered both the effect of one microRNA at a time and all microRNAs combined. In the latter case the Lasso penalized regression method was applied to detect the simultaneous effect of multiple microRNAs.ResultsAn interactome map for breast cancer representing all direct and indirect associations between the expression of microRNAs and proteins was derived. A pattern of extensive coordination between microRNA and protein expression in breast cancer emerges, with multiple clusters of microRNAs being associated with multiple clusters of proteins. Results were subsequently validated in two independent breast cancer data sets. A number of the microRNA-protein associations were functionally validated in a breast cancer cell line.ConclusionsA comprehensive map is derived for the co-expression in breast cancer of microRNAs and 105 proteins with known roles in cancer, after filtering out the in-cis effect of mRNA expression.

Pour G. tachinoides, la bouteille ne presente un net interet que lorsqu'elle est associee au piege monoconique, mais avec des resultats toujours inferieurs a ceux du piege biconique muni d'une cage. La bouteille avec le piege biconique donne des resultats variables selon les annees, mais au mieux equivalents a ceux de la cage. Les differences entre les systemes sont plus nettes chez les mÃ¢les. Pour G. morsitans submorsitans, le systeme piege biconique/cage reste le plus efficace et la bouteille reduit les captures dans les deux types de pieges. Les captures de Tabanidae sont augmentees (parfois doublees) quand on substitue la bouteille a la cage, quel que soit le type de piege.

Fuzzy c-Regression Models with Cluster Characteristics Clarification,"In order to improve the comparative interpretability among cluster-wise local regression models, this paper proposes a modified fuzzy c-regression models (FCRM), which is a fuzzy c-means (FCM)-type switching regression. Based on the combined concepts of ridge regression and intra-cluster exclusive variable selection, cluster-wise meaningful explanatory variables are emphasized. Additionally, it is further extended with the LASSO concept for reducing the inappropriate influences of larger coefficient values. The characteristics of the proposed methods are demonstrated through some numerical experiments.",2019,2019 International Conference on Fuzzy Theory and Its Applications (iFUZZY)
Fish-seastar facilitation leads to algal forest restoration on protected rocky reefs,"Although protected areas can lead to recovery of overharvested species, it is much less clear whether the return of certain predator species or a diversity of predator species can lead to re-establishment of important top-down forces that regulate whole ecosystems. Here we report that the algal recovery in a Mediterranean Marine Protected Area did not derive from the increase in the traditional strong predators, but rather from the establishment of a previously unknown interaction between the thermophilic fish Thalassoma pavo and the seastar Marthasterias glacialis. The interaction resulted in elevated predation rates on sea urchins responsible for algal overgrazing. Manipulative experiments and field observations revealed that the proximity of the seastars triggered an escape response in sea urchins, extending their tube feet. Fishes exploited this behavior by feeding on the exposed tube feet, thus impairing urchin movement, and making them vulnerable to predation by the seastars. These findings suggest that predator diversity generated by MPA establishment can activate positive interactions among predators, with subsequent restoration of the ecosystem structure and function through cascading consumer impacts.",2015,Scientific Reports
"Graph-Based Sparse Learning: Models, Algorithms, and Applications","Sparse learning is a powerful tool to generate models of high-dimensional data with high interpretability, and it has many important applications in areas such as bioinformatics, medical image processing, and computer vision. Recently, the a priori structural information has been shown to be powerful for improving the performance of sparse learning models. A graph is a fundamental way to represent structural information of features. This dissertation focuses on graph-based sparse learning. The first part of this dissertation aims to integrate a graph into sparse learning to improve the performance. Specifically, the problem of feature grouping and selection over a given undirected graph is considered. Three models are proposed along with efficient solvers to achieve simultaneous feature grouping and selection, enhancing estimation accuracy. One major challenge is that it is still computationally challenging to solve large scale graph-based sparse learning problems. An efficient, scalable, and parallel algorithm for one widely used graph-based sparse learning approach, called anisotropic total variation regularization is therefore proposed, by explicitly exploring the structure of a graph. The second part of this dissertation focuses on uncovering the graph structure from the data. Two issues in graphical modeling are considered. One is the joint estimation of multiple graphical models using a fused lasso penalty and the other is the estimation of hierarchical graphical models. The key technical contribution is to establish the necessary and sufficient condition for the graphs to be decomposable. Based on this key property, a simple screening rule is presented, which reduces the size of the optimization problem, dramatically reducing the computational cost.",2014,
Effect of the prior distribution of SNP effects on the estimation of total breeding value,"BackgroundFive main methods, commonly applied in genomic selection, were used to estimate the GEBV on the 15th QTLMAS workshop dataset: GBLUP, LASSO, Bayes A and two Bayes B type of methods (BBn and BBt). GBLUP is a mixed model approach where GEBV are obtained using a relationship matrix calculated from the SNP genotypes. The remaining methods are regression-based approaches where the SNP effects are first estimated and, then GEBV are calculated given the individuals' genotypes.MethodsThe differences between the regression-based methods are in their prior distributions for the SNP effects. The prior distribution for LASSO is a Laplace distribution, for Bayes A is a scaled Student-t distribution, and the Bayes B type methods have a Spike and Slab prior where only a proportion (Ï€) of SNP has an effect, following a given distribution. In this study, two different distributions were considered for the Bayes B type methods: (i) normal and (ii) scaled Student-t. They are referred here as the BBn and BBt methods, respectively. These prior distributions are defined by one or more parameters controlling their scale/rate (Î»), shape (df) or proportion of SNP with effect (Ï€). LASSO requires one (Î»); two for Bayes A (Î», df) and Bayes Bn (Î», Ï€); and three for Bayes Bt (Î», df, Ï€). In this study, all parameters were estimated from the data. An extra scenario for Bayes A and BBt was included where df was not estimated but fixed to 4 (suffixed _4df). The implementation of GBLUP was done using ASREML, the heritability was also estimated from the data. All other methods were implemented using a MCMC approach.ResultsAll Bayes A and B methods showed accuracy (correlation between True and Estimated BV) as high as 0.94 except for BA_4df (r = 0.91). Compared to the traditional BLUP using pedigree information, these methods improved the accuracy between 50 and 55%. GBLUP and LASSO were less accurate (0.81 and 0.85 respectively) and the improvements were 34 and 40% compared to BLUP.ConclusionsResults of all methods were consistent and the accuracies for GEBV ranged between 0.81 and 0.94. When all parameters were estimated the results were similar for the Bayes A and Bayes B methods. Results showed that Bayes A was more sensitive to the changes in the shape parameter, and the parameter changes led to change in the accuracy of GEBV. However BBt was more robust to the change in this parameter. This may be explained by the fact that BBt estimates one extra parameter and it can buffer against a non-proper shape parameter.",2012,BMC Proceedings

"Fine particles, genetic pathways, and markers of inflammation and endothelial dysfunction: Analysis on particulate species and sources","Studies have found associations between PM2.5 and cardiovascular events. The role of different components of PM2.5 is not well understood. We used linear mixed-effects models with the adaptive LASSO penalty to select PM2.5 species and source(s), separately, that may be associated with markers of inflammation and endothelial dysfunction, with adjustment for age, obesity, smoking, statin use, diabetes mellitus, temperature, and season as fixed effects in a large longitudinal cohort of elderly men. We also analyzed these associations with source apportionment models and examined genetic pathwayâ€“air pollution interactions within three relevant pathways (oxidative stress, metal processing, and endothelial function). We found that independent of PM2.5 mass vanadium (V) was associated with intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). An IQR increase (3.2â€‰ng/m3) in 2-day moving average V was associated with a 2.5% (95% CI: 1.2â€“3.8%) change in ICAM-1 and a 3.9% (95% CI: 2.2â€“5.7%) change in VCAM-1, respectively. In addition, an oil combustion source rich in V was linked to these adhesion molecules. People with higher allelic risk profiles related to oxidative stress may have greater associations (P-value of interaction=0.11). Our findings suggest that particles derived from oil combustion may be associated with inflammation and endothelial dysfunction, and it is likely that oxidative stress plays a role in the associations.",2016,Journal of Exposure Science and Environmental Epidemiology
Design and Characterization of Molecular Scaffolds,"In the post-genomic era the study of the interactions between biomolecules and in particular protein-protein interactions is of growing interest, since they are the basis of all the physiological processes mediated by the formation of complexes between biomolecules. Therefore, detailed knowledge of the molecular mechanisms responsible for these interactions is essential to develop molecules capable of modulating the biological activity of the protein target and then its cellular processes. 
Currently, the identification of molecules that inhibit or promote protein-protein interactions or protein-nucleic acids is one of the greatest challenges of drug discovery. Unlike the traditional approach based on the design of molecules modeled on specific substrates for enzymatic active sites, the development of compounds able to modulate protein-protein interactions is a more complex process. The interface molecules involved is usually an extended area that includes more non-contiguous regions lacking suitable pockets of binding to small molecules. Moreover, these regions often have elements of secondary structure that once isolated from their context, not having the protein native conformation. So far, several classes of compounds have been used to modulate protein-protein interactions: antibodies, peptides and small organic molecules and rarely miniproteine [1]. The latter, in fact, while constituting the majority of the active ingredients currently on the market are unsuitable to work with very large surface protein. The antibodies show high specificity and are widely used but have high production costs. The peptides are considered, however, good candidates for developing new compounds that interfere with protein-protein recognition [2]. The main approaches currently used to develop compounds of peptidic nature consists in the screening of phage libraries, parallel synthesis of peptides on membrane and rational design.
Latter requires that the structural and biochemical information available on at least one of the two interacting partners and have been identified residues involved in the bond [3]. If the design of peptides that mimic the structural organization of the segments involved in the interaction is expected to introduce first stage of waste in order to stabilize the secondary structure and a second in which you must enter the residues responsible for interaction in the right spatial orientation.
An alternative approach is to use scaffold [4] molecules structurally stable that already have the desired secondary structure, which can be directly introduced into the residues in the correct spatial orientation.
The aim of this PhD project was to design and characterize molecular scaffold, such as peptides and mini-proteins that can modulate the interactions between biomolecules.
This aim was addressed by three different approaches:
â€¢ The development of a new synthetic strategy for obtaining polypeptides, functionally active protein expressed by ligation;
â€¢ The bio-physical characterization of a helical peptide scaffold;
â€¢ The transfer of functional epitopes on a scaffold protein known.

The first strategy consists in developing a procedure for binding by stable covalent bonds the C-terminus of two polypeptide fragments obtained by recombinant expression in bacteria. This strategy allows to obtain peptide model systems [5] and mini-proteins that retain the same functionality of the target protein but whose dimensions are considerably reduced. The synthetic strategy provides for the chemical ligation reaction between two polypeptides activated as the C-terminal thioester and a bifunctional linker is characterized by the presence of two cysteines in position pseudo N-terminal. The linker was synthesized from dall'etilendiammina which they were linked to two cysteine residues via a peptide bond. The mini-protein to the C-terminal thioester was obtained using expression vectors containing inteine [6]. The synthetic procedure was developed using as a model system for the mini-protein, the sequence coding for the cloning site of the vector pTrcHisA. The vector was modified by the insertion dell'inteina MxeGyrA (N198A). The fusion construct was expressed in cells BL21 (DE3) of Escherichia coli and purified by affinity chromatography on chitin resin, the mini-protein thioester was obtained following the dell'inteina splicing in the presence of thiols. Following the mini-protein thioester was used in two separate ligation reactions with the linker, to obtain homodimers and heterodimers. The pure products, characterized by LC-MS, were all obtained with good yields [7]. This synthetic strategy offers the opportunity to unite chemically two protein fragments in a stable manner through the use of a bifunctional linker, which can be suitably modified by varying the length and rigidity of the spacer between the cysteine residues and this has considerable potential for biotechnological applications . This methodology can be used to combine neighboring peptide chains in space but not in sequence, to mimic, for example, discontinuous epitopes, to synthesize scaffolds of small (mini-antibody) as an alternative dimerization domains such as Leucin zipper.

For the second approach has made the chemical and physical characterization of a peptide for its possible use as scaffolds for helical structural reasons. 
It was recently described a peptide, QK, able to mimic in vitro and in vivo biological activity of VEGF [8-10] in aqueous solution which assumes a well-defined helical conformation. Analysis of circular dichroism and NMR data indicate that the peptide QK has a thermal stability is unusual for a peptide composed only of natural amino acids. To assess the structural determinants of this stability, the experimental data have been supplemented with molecular dynamics simulations. 
Theoretical studies have indicated that the N-terminal region and a hydrophobic contact between the Leu7 and Leu10 are important for the thermal stability of the peptide. 
To test these predictions have been synthesized 3 peptides similar QK: QK1-12 that lacks the C-terminal; QK4-15 than the N-terminal and QK10A, in which Leu10 was replaced with un'alanina. The analysis of peptides by circular dichroism and NMR showed that QK1-12, unlike QK4-15, maintains a helical structure and thermal stability similar to QK, QK10A has about half the helical content and does not retain 's unusual thermal stability [11]. Finally, using a combination of experimental techniques such as CD, NMR and MD was possible to characterize at atomic one possible pathway for formation of the peptide helix QK10A and provide information sull'inusuale thermal stability of the peptide QK prerequisite for its use as helical scaffold.

The third approach has included the development of a mini-biologically active protein from a scaffold known. The biological system chosen was that of VEGF and its receptors. An analysis of three-dimensional structure of the complex between VEGF/Flt-1D2 and mutagenesis have identified residues important for binding to VEGF receptors [12], these data demonstrated that the binding region of VEGF receptor includes the helix 17-25. 
The scaffold was the chosen Avian Pancreatic Polypeptide (APP), a miniproteina of 36 amino acids, very stable, which owns un'Î±-helix exposed to solvent and thruster poliprolina type II. Based on the overlap of the propeller of VEGF and the APP scaffold have been designed in which two different molecules have been transferred to the residues responsible for interaction with VEGF receptors and the peptide QK respectively named APP1 and APP_QK. Molecules are designed and the wild type were obtained by recombinant cells BL21 (DE3) of Escherichia coli. 
The proteins were purified by affinity chromatography and analyzed by LC-MS. Finally, preliminary in vitro biological assays have shown for the molecule APP_QK a similar activity to that of QK peptide. 
In conclusion, this work by providing different approaches contribute significantly to the development of new scaffolds for targeting protein-protein interactions.

Sparse additive models,"We present a new class of methods for high dimensional non-parametric regression and classification called sparse additive models. Our methods combine ideas from sparse linear modelling and additive non-parametric regression. We derive an algorithm for fitting the models that is practical and effective even when the number of covariates is larger than the sample size. Sparse additive models are essentially a functional version of the grouped lasso of Yuan and Lin. They are also closely related to the COSSO model of Lin and Zhang but decouple smoothing and sparsity, enabling the use of arbitrary non-parametric smoothers. We give an analysis of the theoretical properties of sparse additive models and present empirical results on synthetic and real data, showing that they can be effective in fitting sparse non-parametric models in high dimensional data.

HSP90 and pCREB alterations are linked to mancozebâ€dependent behavioral and neurodegenerative effects in a marine teleost,"ABSTRACT The pesticide mancozeb (mz) is recognized as a potent inducer of oxidative stress due to its ability to catalyze the production of reactive oxygen species plus inhibiting mitochondrial respiration thus becoming an environmental risk for neurodegenerative diseases. Despite numerous toxicological studies on mz have been directed to mammals, attention on marine fish is still lacking. Thus, it was our intention to evaluate neurobehavioral activities of ornate wrasses (Thalassoma pavo) exposed to 0.2 mg/l of mz after a preliminary screening test (0.07â€“0.3 mg/l). Treated fish exhibited an evident (p < 0.001) latency to reach Tâ€maze arms (> 1000%) while exploratory attitudes (total arm entries) diminished (âˆ’ 50%; p < 0.05) versus controls during spontaneous exploration tests. Moreover, they showed evident enhancements (+ 111%) of immobility in the cylinder test. Contextually, strong (âˆ’ 88%; p < 0.01) reductions of permanence in light zone of the Light/Dark apparatus along with diminished crossings (âˆ’ 65%) were also detected. Conversely, wrasses displayed evident enhancements (160%) of risk assessment consisting of fast entries in the dark side of this apparatus. From a molecular point of view, a notable activation (p < 0.005) of the brain transcription factor pCREB occurred during mzâ€exposure. Similarly, in situ hybridization supplied increased HSP90 mRNAs in most brain areas such as the lateral part of the dorsal telencephalon (Dl; + 68%) and valvula of the cerebellum (VCe; + 35%) that also revealed evident argyrophilic signals. Overall, these first indications suggest a possible protective role of the early biomarkers pCREB and HSP90 against fish toxicity. HIGHLIGHTSFish exposed to mancozeb exhibited an evident latency to reach Tâ€maze arms.Mancozeb caused immobility and reduction of explorative attitudes.Fish exposed to mancozeb showed anxiogenic performances in the Light/Dark apparatus.The brain of fish exposed to mancozeb supplied pCREB plus HSP90 mRNA upâ€regulations.Some brain areas of fish exposed to mancozeb revealed an evident neurodegeneration.",2017,Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology

A Robust High-Resolution DOA Estimation Algorithm Based on Compressive Sensing,"To enhance the performance of compressive sensing multi-targets' direction of arrival( CS-DOA) estimation ability in the presence of mismatch between system sensing model and the targets' angle information,a novel robust highresolution DOA estimation method is proposed by combining the regularized multi-vector focal undetermined system solver( RMFOCUSS) with least-absolute shrinkage and selection operator( LASSO) algorithm. First,a DOA estimation sparse model is established by exploiting the mismatch between system sensing model and targets' angle information. Then, RMFOCUSS and LASSO algorithm are employed to iteratively optimize targets' angle vectors and system model mismatch error respectively. The proposed method improves DOA estimation accuracy in terms of existing mismatch for CS-DOA, overcomes the defect that CS recovery algorithms can 't be used in low signal-to-noise ratio case,and has lower computational complexity. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented DOA method.",2014,
Sparse learning with duality gap guarantee,"We propose a general regularized empirical risk minimization framework for sparse learning which accommodates popular regularizers such as lasso, group lasso, and the trace norm. Within this framework, we develop two optimization algorithms. The first method is based on squared penalties added to the empirical risk and is solved using a subgradient-based L-BFGS quasi-Newton method. The second method is based on constraints imposed on sparsity-inducing norms and is solved using a gradient projection method. A notable advantage of our approaches is that a simple way to access the dual objective value is available, which is useful in tracking the progress of optimization and deciding when to terminate the optimization procedure.",2008,

An ensemble learning method for variable selection: application to high dimensional data and missing values,"Standard approaches for variable selection in linear models are not tailored to deal properly with high dimensional and incomplete data. Currently, methods dedicated to high dimensional data handle missing values by ad-hoc strategies, like complete case analysis or single imputation, while methods dedicated to missing values, mainly based on multiple imputation, do not discuss the imputation method to use with high dimensional data. Consequently, both approaches appear to be limited for many modern applications. 
With inspiration from ensemble methods, a new variable selection method is proposed. It extends classical variable selection methods such as stepwise, lasso or knockoff in the case of high dimensional data with or without missing data. Theoretical properties are studied and the practical interest is demonstrated through a simulation study. 
In the low dimensional case without missing values, the performances of the method can be better than those obtained by standard techniques. Moreover, the procedure improves the control of the error risks. With missing values, the method performs better than reference selection methods based on multiple imputation. Similar performances are obtained in the high-dimensional case with or without missing values.",2018,arXiv: Methodology

Hopi Sovereignty as Epistemological Limit,"S P R I N G 2 0 0 9 W I C A Z O S A R E V I E W The headlines of the March 6, 1886, edition of the Illustrated Police News, a late nineteenth-century London weekly, read â€œCowed by a Woman: A Craven Red Villain Weakens in the Face of a Resolute White Heroineâ€”Exciting Adventure in an Indian Village in Arizona.â€ The now famous illustration accompanying the story showed anthropologists Colonel James and Mathilda Coxe Stevenson confronting Hopi village members who had barred their entrance into a village kiva (see Figure 1). The Stevensons had been sent from Washington, D.C., by Major John Wesley Powell, the founding director of the Smithsonianâ€™s Bureau of American Ethnology, to collect samples of Hopi ceremonial paraphernalia and to describe the ritual activities being conducted with them. The image shows Coxe Stevenson, generally recognized as one of the most important pre-Boasian ethnologists of the American Southwest,1 waving her fi st at a Hopi man, while her husband stands behind her, brandishing a rifl e. Around them are several Hopis, some standing above and some emerging below from the underground kiva.

On Weighted Support Vector Regression,"We propose a new type of weighted support vector regression (SVR), motivated by modeling local dependencies in time and space in prediction of house prices. The classic weights of the weighted SVR are added to the slack variables in the objective function (OF-weights). This procedure directly shrinks the coefficient of each observation in the estimated functions; thus, it is widely used for minimizing influence of outliers. We propose to additionally add weights to the slack variables in the constraints (CF-weights) and call the combination of weights the doubly weighted SVR. We illustrate the differences and similarities of the two types of weights by demonstrating the connection between the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and the SVR. We show that an SVR problem can be transformed to a LASSO problem plus a linear constraint and a box constraint. We demonstrate the capabilities of the doubly weighted approach through an example of prediction of house prices. The weight functions in the house pricing model depend on the geographical distance to the house of interest and the difference in time of sale (CF-weights) as well as the differences lying in variables (OF-weights), such as house size and number of floors. The results illustrate that the combination of the two types of weights describes the relative importance of observations very well and lowers the influence of possible outliers. Therefore, it enables the SVR models to have good performance. Copyright Â© 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",2014,Quality and Reliability Eng. Int.
What health records data are required for accurate prediction of suicidal behavior?,"OBJECTIVE
The study sought to evaluate how availability of different types of health records data affect the accuracy of machine learning models predicting suicidal behavior.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Records from 7 large health systems identified 19Â 061Â 056 outpatient visits to mental health specialty or general medical providers between 2009 and 2015. Machine learning models (logistic regression with penalized LASSO [least absolute shrinkage and selection operator] variable selection) were developed to predict suicide death (nâ€‰=â€‰1240) or probable suicide attempt (nâ€‰=â€‰24Â 133) in the following 90 days. Base models were used only historical insurance claims data and were then augmented with data regarding sociodemographic characteristics (race, ethnicity, and neighborhood characteristics), past patient-reported outcome questionnaires from electronic health records, and data (diagnoses and questionnaires) recorded during the visit.


RESULTS
For prediction of any attempt following mental health specialty visits, a model limited to historical insurance claims data performed approximately as well (C-statistic 0.843) as a model using all available data (C-statistic 0.850). For prediction of suicide attempt following a general medical visit, addition of data recorded during the visit yielded a meaningful improvement over a model using all data up to the prior day (C-statistic 0.853 vs 0.838).


DISCUSSION
Results may not generalize to setting with less comprehensive data or different patterns of care. Even the poorest-performing models were superior to brief self-report questionnaires or traditional clinical assessment.


CONCLUSIONS
Implementation of suicide risk prediction models in mental health specialty settings may be less technically demanding than expected. In general medical settings, however, delivery of optimal risk predictions at the point of care may require more sophisticated informatics capability.",2019,Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA
Asymptotic properties for combined L1 and concave regularization,"Two important goals of high-dimensional modelling are prediction and variable selection. In this article, we consider regularization with combined L1 and concave penalties, and study the sampling properties of the global optimum of the suggested method in ultrahigh-dimensional settings. The L1 penalty provides the minimum regularization needed for removing noise variables in order to achieve oracle prediction risk, while a concave penalty imposes additional regularization to control model sparsity. In the linear model setting, we prove that the global optimum of our method enjoys the same oracle inequalities as the lasso estimator and admits an explicit bound on the false sign rate, which can be asymptotically vanishing. Moreover, we establish oracle risk inequalities for the method and the sampling properties of computable solutions. Numerical studies suggest that our method yields more stable estimates than using a concave penalty alone.",2014,Biometrika
Gold During the Renaissance,"The Renaissance, rebirth, or more strictly speaking the intellectual revival of Europe in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, was marked by the advent of Humanism, a revolution in art, sculpture, and letters but with relatively little progress in natural science, and during much of the sixteenth century by the Reformation led by the son of a miner, Martin Luther (1483â€“1546). The Humanists devoted themselves to the study of the language, literature, and antiquities of ancient Greece and Rome, hoping to find in the past a novel form of thought about nature for the future. They considered themselves in rebellion against the scholasticism of medieval times and were preoccupied with man in relation to human society rather than to God. The foundation of the Vatican Library at Rome by Pope Nicholas V was a landmark of the Renaissance, as were also the writings of Alberti, Castiglione, Machiavelli, Erasmus, More, Shakespeare, and Luther in the fields of social and political thought, literature, and religious doctrine. In music, architecture, sculpture, and art it was the period of Orlando di Lasso, Palestrina, Brunelleschi, Raphael, Donatello, Botticelli, Titian, Cellini, Leonardo da Vinci, Durer, Holbein, van Eyck, Breughel, and Michelangelo. As one gazes up at Michelangeloâ€™s Creation of Man on the ceiling of the vault of the Sistine Chapel of St. Peterâ€™s in Rome, one sees in Adam a veritable symbol of awakening Renaissance man marveling at all about him.",1987,
Oral Session I 10 : 15 AM-12 : 30 PM Saturday March 12 McClung Auditorium 10 : 00 AM â€“ Coffee Break 10 : 15 AM 1 : Metabolic Pathways Of Hydrocarbon-degrading Bacteria From The Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill,"The Deepwater Horizon (DWH) blowout in the northern Gulf of Mexico represents one of the largest marine oil spills. Significant shifts in bacterial community composition in the water column correlated to the microbial degradation and utilization of oil hydrocarbons. Nevertheless, the full genetic potential and taxon-specific metabolisms of bacterial hydrocarbon degraders enriched during the DWH spill remain largely unresolved. To address this gap, we reconstructed genomes of novel, marine bacteria enriched from sea surface and plume spill communities by coupling stable-isotope probing with genomic reconstruction. Thereby, we could identify bacterial community members that actively assimilate alkane and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and resolve their physiological capabilities. We reconstructed a total of 7 genomes, including one genome from an alkane SIP-enrichment using n-hexadecane and three genomes each from PAH SIP-enrichments using naphthalene or phenanthrene. Marinobacter represented the active, alkane-degrading SIPpopulation, while uncultured Alphaand Gammaproteobacteria, such as Thalassospira and Alcanivorax, characterized the PAH-degrading communities. Despite the observation that only Marinobacter actively degraded alkanes, metabolic pathways for alkane degradation were present in all of the 7 assembled high-quality genomes. Interestingly, the biochemical repertoire of PAH utilization varied among the different bacterial species and the combined capabilities of the microbial community exceeded those of its individual components. Altogether, this implies that the degradation of a complex hydrocarbon mixture requires the non-redundant capabilities of a complex oil-degrading community.",2016,
