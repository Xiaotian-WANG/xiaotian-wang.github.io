First draft genome sequence of a strain from the genus Fusibacter isolated from Salar de AscotÃ¡n in Northern Chile,"Fusibacter sp. 3D3 (ATCC BAA-2418) is an arsenate-reducing halotolerant strain within the Firmicutes phylum, isolated from the Salar de AscotÃ¡n, a hypersaline salt flat in Northern Chile. This high-Andean closed basin is an athalassohaline environment located at the bottom of a tectonic basin surrounded by mountain range, including some active volcanoes. This landscape can be an advantageous system to explore the effect of salinity on microorganisms that mediate biogeochemical reactions. Since 2000, microbial reduction of arsenic has been evidenced in the system, and the phylogenetic analysis of the original community plus the culture enrichments has revealed the predominance of Firmicutes phylum. Here, we describe the first whole draft genome sequence of an arsenic-reducing strain belonging to the Fusibacter genus showing the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity (98%) with Fusibacter sp. strain Vns02. The draft genome consists of 57 contigs with 5,111,250Â bp and an average GÂ +Â C content of 37.6%. Out of 4780 total genes predicted, 4700 genes code for proteins and 80 genes for RNAs. Insights from the genome sequence and some microbiological features of the strain 3D3 are available under Bioproject accession PRJDB4973 and Biosample SAMD00055724. The release of the genome sequence of this strain could contribute to the understanding of the arsenic biogeochemistry in extreme environments.",2017,Standards in Genomic Sciences

Debiasing the Debiased Lasso with Bootstrap,"In this paper, we prove that under proper conditions, bootstrap can further debias the debiased Lasso estimator for statistical inference of low-dimensional parameters in high-dimensional linear regression. We prove that the required sample size for inference with bootstrapped debiased Lasso, which involves the number of small coefficients, can be of smaller order than the existing ones for the debiased Lasso. Therefore, our results reveal the benefits of having strong signals. Our theory is supported by results of simulation experiments, which compare coverage probabilities and lengths of confidence intervals with and without bootstrap, with and without debiasing.",2017,arXiv: Statistics Theory
[Comparison of the effectiveness of pulmonary veins isolation vs linear radiofrequency ablation in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation patients using either mathematical scanning or clinical approach].,"AIM
to compare clinical results of linear ablation vs. PVI approach in patients with paroxysmal AF and to estimate theoretical probability of 4-waves re-entry to eliminate as a results of the both ablative techniques formatting by means left atrial geometry two-dimensional mathematical modeling.


MATERIAL AND METHODS
Clinical phase. Study was conducted on 20 pts (6 women, 51,4Â±13,6 years of age) with paroxysmal AF underwent index RFA. All pts were divided into two age-sex-arrhythmia history duration-antiarrhythmic drugs (AAD)-matched groups. The first group consisted of 10 pts (3 women, mean age - 51,1Â±11,9, history of arrhythmia - 3,2Â±1,2 years) in whom ablation strategy consisted of PVI using LASSO technique. The second group concluded of 10 pts (3 women, mean age - 51,1Â±12,9, history of arrhythmia- 3,1Â±1,1 years) in whom ablation strategy consisted of wide-area circumferential lines application around pulmonary veins, combined to roof line and mitral isthmus RFA using three-dimensional mapping system. Mathematical phase. As the first step numeric reconstruction of the autowave process in excitable tissues of the left atrium and the simulation of AF was performed. Fitzhugh-Nagumo equation was used for simulation to enabled us to take into account the electrical inhomogeneity of the atria (pulmonary vein ostia). A special scanning method was used for calculating characteristics of autowave processes in a two-dimensional mathematical model of the atrium. As the second step simulation of circular (corresponding to LASSO approach) and linear ablation (corresponding to 3D approach) was performed.


RESULTS
Clinical phase. There were no complications associated with RFA. 7 pts of the first group vs 4 pts of the second subgroup had early recurrences of arrhythmia. AAD free sinus rhythm incidence in the first/second groups was 80%/20% at 12 months respectively (p=0,003). Mathematical phase. While circular LASSO-like ablation pattern was used, there was no elimination of 4-waves re-entry turning around the pulmonary veins ostia and vortex waves caused by them in a distributed two-dimensional atrial medium after time period equal to the re-entry period. Thus, the circular ablation formatting does not affect peripulmonary veins re-entry and, therefore, does not suppress AF. In contrast, linear ablation patterns suppress arrhythmias caused by 4-waves re-entry in two-dimensional mathematical modeling of the left atrium.


CONCLUSION
Mathematical approach using linear ablation to simulate suppressed 4-waves re-entry more effectively comparing to PVI only. Clinical results are consistent with ablation formatting data obtained by means of 4-waves re-entry simulation in a two-dimensional mathematical modeling of the left atrium.",2012,Kardiologiia

Regression Analysis and Prediction of Mini-Mental State Examination Score in Alzheimer's Disease Using Multi-granularity Whole-Brain Segmentations,"We presented and evaluated three sparsity learning based regression models with application to the automated prediction of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores in Alzheimerâ€™s disease(AD) using T1-weight magnetic resonance images (MRIs) from 678 subjects, including 190 healthy control (HC) subjects, 331 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects, and 157 AD subjects. The raw features were obtained from a validated multi-granularity whole-brain analysis pipeline, providing multi-level whole-brain segmentation volumes. We employed the ridge, lasso, and elastic-net as our regression algorithms, with the whole-brain volumes at each level being the independent variables and the MMSE score being the dependent variable. We used 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate the prediction performance and another 10-fold inner loop to estimate the optimal parameters in each model. According to our results, the combination of elastic-net and the second level of whole-brain segmentation volumes (a total of 137 volumes) worked the best compared to all other possible combinations. The work presented in this paper provides a potentially powerful and novel non-invasive biomarker for AD.",2017,
Refined colorimetry validates endangered subspecies of the least tern,"In contrast to the results of Thompson et al. (1992), refined colorimetry validates three subspecies of Least Tern in North America, Sterna antillarum antillarum (Lesson), S. a. browni Mearns, and S. a. athalassos Burleigh and Lowery. Four of nine color characters exhibited significant seasonal differences, presumably a result of plumage wear and bleaching. The sexes differed in lightness and hue of dorsum and hind neck. Males of S. a. athalassos differed significantly from those of both S. a. antillarum and S. a. browni in lightness of dorsum, and males of S. a. browni differed significantly from those of S. a. antillarum in lightness of hind neck. Females generally showed patterns concordant with males. Because S. a. browni and S. a. athalassos are listed as endangered, the validity of these taxa is important to conservationists and managers. Rigorous systematic methodology and scientific collections of high quality are indispensable to conservation biology.",1998,The Condor

Credit Scoring Analysis using LASSO Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM),"Credit scoring analysis using logistic regression is less effective, as it requires hypothesis and assumption testings that must be fulfilled. Therefore, LASSO logistic regression analysis can be used to overcome this problem because it does not require hypothesis and assumption testings. In addition, Support Vector Machine (SVM) method is also a classification method that has good classification capability as well as can ignore all assumptions such as logistic regression. This study aims to study the factors that affect the smoothness of debtors in paying motorcycle credits and compare the goodness of both methods used. Explanatory variables that affect the smoothness of credit payments are the phone ownership, down payment, loan term, occupation, age, marital status, gender, education level, number of dependents, motorcycle type, interaction between motorcycle type with phone ownership and down payment, interaction between phone ownership with occupation, loan terms, and phone number ownership, interaction between downpayment with loan terms, installments, gender and educational level, and interaction between occupation with tyype of income. Application of LASSO logistic regression and SVM in this case have mostly the same classification accuracy. However, the results of the classification performance using SVM method is relatively stable compared with LASSO logistic regression Keywords-logistic regression, LASSO, classification, support vector machine",2017,
A generalised OMP algorithm for feature selection with application to gene expression data,"Feature selection for predictive analytics is the problem of identifying a minimal-size subset of features that is maximally predictive of an outcome of interest. To apply to molecular data, feature selection algorithms need to be scalable to tens of thousands of available features. In this paper, we propose gOMP, a highly-scalable generalisation of the Orthogonal Matching Pursuit feature selection algorithm to several directions: (a) different types of outcomes, such as continuous, binary, nominal, and time-to-event, (b) different types of predictive models (e.g., linear least squares, logistic regression), (c) different types of predictive features (continuous, categorical), and (d) different, statistical-based stopping criteria. We compare the proposed algorithm against LASSO, a prototypical, widely used algorithm for high-dimensional data. On dozens of simulated datasets, as well as, real gene expression datasets, gOMP is on par, or outperforms LASSO for case-control binary classification, quantified outcomes (regression), and (censored) survival times (time-to-event) analysis. gOMP has also several theoretical advantages that are discussed. While gOMP is based on quite simple and basic statistical ideas, easy to implement and to generalize, we also show in an extensive evaluation that it is also quite effective in bioinformatics analysis settings.",2020,ArXiv

"Folded concave penalized sparse linear regression: sparsity, statistical performance, and algorithmic theory for local solutions","This paper concerns the folded concave penalized sparse linear regression (FCPSLR), a class of popular sparse recovery methods. Although FCPSLR yields desirable recovery performance when solved globally, computing a global solution is NP-complete. Despite some existing statistical performance analyses on local minimizers or on specific FCPSLR-based learning algorithms, it still remains open questions whether local solutions that are known to admit fully polynomial-time approximation schemes (FPTAS) may already be sufficient to ensure the statistical performance, and whether that statistical performance can be non-contingent on the specific designs of computing procedures. To address the questions, this paper presents the following threefold results: (1) Any local solution (stationary point) is a sparse estimator, under some conditions on the parameters of the folded concave penalties. (2) Perhaps more importantly, any local solution satisfying a significant subspace second-order necessary condition (S$$^3$$3ONC), which is weaker than the second-order KKT condition, yields a bounded error in approximating the true parameter with high probability. In addition, if the minimal signal strength is sufficient, the S$$^3$$3ONC solution likely recovers the oracle solution. This result also explicates that the goal of improving the statistical performance is consistent with the optimization criteria of minimizing the suboptimality gap in solving the non-convex programming formulation of FCPSLR. (3) We apply (2) to the special case of FCPSLR with minimax concave penalty and show that under the restricted eigenvalue condition, any S$$^3$$3ONC solution with a better objective value than the Lasso solution entails the strong oracle property. In addition, such a solution generates a model error (ME) comparable to the optimal but exponential-time sparse estimator given a sufficient sample size, while the worst-case ME is comparable to the Lasso in general. Furthermore, to guarantee the S$$^3$$3ONC admits FPTAS.",2017,Mathematical Programming

Microevolutionary processes in the stygobitic genus Typhlocirolana (Isopoda Flabellifera Cirolanidae) as inferred by partial 12S and 16S rDNA sequences,"Morocco is one of the regions of the world where many interesting discoveries have recently been made in the field of stygobiology, particularly concerning the cirolanid isopod fauna. One of the most interesting, variable and wide spread of these taxa is the perimediterranean stygobitic genus Typhlocirolana Racovitza, 1905, which has colonized the continental groundwater of Israel, Sicily, Spain, the Balearic Islands, Algeria and Morocco with several species. More populations have recently been found in Morocco, in some southern regions around Agadir, in High Atlas valleys near Marrakech and in the northeastern part of the country close to Oujda. The populations of these zones are not yet described and are the subject of this molecular analysis, together with other already designated species. To investigate the phylogenetic relationships and evolutionary history of the Typhlocirolana populations inhabiting the western Mediterranean basin, we analysed DNA sequences from the mitochondrial 12S and 16S rDNA genes. The molecular data were also used to infer the mechanisms driving the evolution of this thalassoid limnostygobitic cirolanid taxon, considered a good paleogeographic indicator because of its poor dispersion abilities. Vicariance because of paleogeographic events in the western Mediterranean basin played a prime evolutionary role in the Cirolanidae, as already suggested by morphological and ecological studies. Application of a molecular clock provided a time framework of the microevolutionary events occurring in Typhlocirolana populations over the last 40 myr.",2004,Journal of Zoological Systematics and Evolutionary Research

HCV is a member of the Flaviviridae family of viruses with a single stranded, positive-sense RNA. It employs RNA polymerase as an essential aspect of its replication. The vast majority of HCV infected patients develop chronic hepatitis after an initial acute infection as a result of HCVâ€™s ability to replicate in hepatocytes without direct cytopathic activity. Ultimately, longterm HCV infection increases liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer and is the leading contributor to liver transplants. Efforts to develop novel treatments for HCV infection led to the development of both nucleoside analogue and non-nucleoside inhibitors of RNA polymerase. Nucleoside analogues are typically incorporated into viral replication process and terminate RNA chain growth, thus blocking viral replication. This patent application describes a series of nucleoside analogues capable of inhibiting HCV replication and claims them for the treatment of HCV infection.

Book Review: Disaster and after: the practicalities of information service in times of war and other catastrophes,"The book contains the proceedings of a conference sponsored b y the International Group of the Library Association in September 1998 at the University of Bristol. The papers are as follows: Linda Stoddart â€˜Managing information for disasters: examples from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in Africaâ€™; John F. Dean â€˜Burma, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam: the road towards recovery for library and archival collections after war and civil unrestâ€™; Maj Klasson â€˜Psychological effects of the LinkÃ¶ping fire (and some strategies for overcoming the problems in the first few months)â€™; Bozena BednarekMichalska â€˜The Polish floods of 1997: the Information Department of Nicholas Copernicus University Library as flood relief headquartersâ€™; Andrzej Nowakowski â€˜The Polish floods of 1997: the Poznan perspectiveâ€™; John Gray â€˜Documenting civil conflict: the case of the Linen Hall Library, Belfastâ€™; Resoum Kidane â€˜Information services during the war in Eritrea, 1961 â€“ 1991â€™; Diana Sayej-Naser â€˜Imprisioned information: the case of the Palestinian occupied territories during the Intifada and beyondâ€™; Vladimir S. Lazarev â€˜Chernobyl: how solutions were found in Belarus to remedy the lack of available scientific informationâ€™; Sava Peic and Aisa Telalovic â€˜Sarajevo: coping with disasterâ€™; and Marie-Therese Varlamoff â€˜Coping with disasters: IFLAâ€™s role in the ICBS (International Committee of the Blue Shield) and in co-operative initiatives to preserve the Memory of the Worldâ€™. There is an introduction by Derek Law and an afterword, â€˜A holistic approach to information services and times of disasterâ€™ by the conference chairman, Paul Sturges. The first impression, at least from the title of the book, is that this is another treatise on disaster control management and how to deal with fairly localized library problems. In fact, only the two papers on the Polish floods fall into this category, and even here the floods were much more widespread and caused more devastation than the usual examples mentioned in advice on disaster control. However, although the problem for Poland was pervasive, to some extent for Polish librarians it was how to cope with countless, priceless, dripping-wet books â€“ a problem which all librarians will be aware of, in theory if not in practice. Maj Klasson, too, deals with the results of a fire in one library, although once again not quite in the way the general reader expects, since she does not discuss the effects on the stock, but on the psychological health of the staff. Besides the two Polish accounts, most papers are about very large catastrophes affecting whole communities or even whole countries, rather than disasters confined to one library. John Dean deals with the almost complete annihilation of libraries in South-east Asia; and Sava Peic and Aisa Telalovic with the bombardment of Sarajevo from 1992 to 1995 by the Serbian army in which several libraries, including the national library of Bosnia and Herzegovina, were deliberately targeted and destroyed. Nevertheless, it could be argued that some of these bear a relation to standard works on disaster control in that the beginnings of a recovery programme are described. Nonetheless, it is not easy to discern a central theme for the conference and some papers have no connection with standard disaster control. Linda Stoddart is concerned with information management during a disaster (do you need blankets and tents and, if so, how many? etc.) and a few others touch on this topic (most of Vladimir Lazarevâ€™s â€˜Chernobylâ€™). Kidane and Sayej-Naser are concerned with information management by one side in an armed conflict (how do we contradict what the other side is saying? how do we circulate our own information despite heavy censorship?) As Paul Sturges remarks (p.168), some of the writers exhibit â€˜partisanshipâ€™ and this is certainly true of Kidane and Sayej-Naser. Ehiopia and Israel would be hard pressed to agree with anything in these two papers. In the eye of the storm is John Grayâ€™s account of Belfastâ€™s Linen Hall Library which has calmly gone about its non-partisan business of collecting documents from both the Republicans and the Loyalists throughout the worst of the Northern Ireland troubles. But here again his paper has nothing to do with disaster control and not much with information management during a disaster either. Thus, there is a division between the papers by Dean, Klasson, Bednarek-Michalska and Nowakowski on one side, and Stoddart, Kidane, Sayej-Naser, Lazarev, and Peic and Telalovic on the other, with John Gray sitting in the middle. For some years now there has been a fair amount of agreement on the best way to tackle a disaster in a library, but the disasters described here are either overwhelming or part of the mad, frenzied destruction of total conflict, attempts to obliterate not only the lives, but every record of the â€˜opponentsâ€™. An immediate reaction is bewilderment and a sense that the problems described are beyond control.

Segmentale ostiale Katheterablation der Pulmonalvenen bei paroxysmalem Vorhofflimmern: Ergebnisse nach einjÃ¤hriger Erfahrung,"Segmental ostial catheter ablation of the pulmonary veins in atrial fibrillation: insights from a one year experience. Treatment in patients with highly symptomatic paroxsymal atrial fibrillation (PAF) refractory to antiarrhythmic drugs remains a challenging task in clinical cardiology. Based on new insights in the genesis of PAF initiated by rapid focal discharges within the pulmonary veins (PV), Haissaguerre and his group recently introduced a novel catheter based approach isolating PV electrical activity. By use of a circular decapolar mapping catheter (LASSO , Biosense Webster) positioned within the PV ostium electrical activity of the left atrial (LA)-PV breakthrough of PV fascicles can be localized. Segmental ostial radio-frequency (RF) energy delivery is performed with an additional deflectable ablation catheter. In this paper we report on our own results within the first year of clinical experience (from December 2000 to December 2001) in 37 patients (pat.) aged 53 Â± 11 years. A total of 115 PV (3.1 PV/pat.) were treated in 57 interventions (1.5/pat.). With a mean follow-up of 275 Â± 100 days there was a remarkably high percentage of overall clinical response (86 % of pat.) defined as complete absence or highly reduced number of clinical recurrences with 18/37 pat. (49 %) currently drug-free. Quality of life questionnaires revealed a significant increase in physical and mental health scores. However, a single case of severe stroke occurred. In addition, serial contrastenhanced spiral computer tomography was performed to visualize the PV orifices before and in regular intervals after the procedure showing 2/115 PV (1.73 %) stenoses > 70 % up to date. As a conclusion, PV ostial isolation by segmental RF catheter ablation seems a highly effective novel therapeutic approach with acceptable safety. As the procedure is still complex and severe adverse events may occur it should be carried out in specialized centers at this point in time.

"6-month efficacy, tolerance, and acceptability of a short regimen of oral zidovudine to reduce vertical transmission of HIV in breastfed children in CÃ´te d'Ivoire and Burkina Faso: a double-blind placebo-controlled multicentre trial","BACKGROUND
Zidovudine reduces the rate of vertical transmission of HIV in non-breastfed populations. We assessed the acceptability, tolerance, and 6-month efficacy of a short regimen of oral zidovudine in African populations practising breastfeeding.


METHODS
A randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial was carried out in public clinics of Abidjan, CÃ´te d'Ivoire, and Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso. Eligible participants were women aged 18 years or older, who had confirmed HIV-1 infection and pregnancy of 36-38 weeks duration, and who gave written informed consent. Exclusion criteria were severe anaemia, neutropenia, abnormal liver function, and sickle-cell disease. Women were randomly assigned zidovudine (n=214; 300 mg twice daily until labour, 600 mg at beginning of labour, and 300 mg twice daily for 7 days post partum) or matching placebo (n=217). The primary outcome was the diagnosis of HIV-1 infection in the infant on the basis of sequential DNA PCR tests at days 1-8, 45, 90, and 180. We compared the probability of infection at a given age in the two groups. Analyses were by intention to treat.


FINDINGS
Women were enrolled between September, 1995, and February, 1998, when enrolment to the placebo group was stopped. Analysis was based on 421 women and 400 lifeborn infants. Baseline demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics were similar in the two groups. The Kaplan-Meier probability of HIV infection in the infant at 6 months was 18.0% in the zidovudine group (n=192) and 27.5% in the placebo group (n=197; relative efficacy 0.38 [95% CI 0.05-0.60]; p=0.027). Adjustment for centre, period of recruitment, mode of delivery, maternal CD4-cell count, duration of labour, prolonged rupture of membranes, and duration of breastfeeding did not change the treatment effect. The proportions of women taking more than 80% of the planned maximum dose were 75% before delivery, 81% during labour, and 83% post partum, without statistical difference between the groups. No major adverse biological or clinical event was reported in excess among women and children of the zidovudine group.


INTERPRETATION
A short course of oral zidovudine given during the peripartum period is well accepted and well tolerated, and provides a 38% reduction in early vertical transmission of HIV-1 infection despite breastfeeding.",1999,The Lancet
Force relaxation between latex and non-latex orthodontic elastics in simulated saliva solution.,"UNLABELLED
The aim of this study was to compare the force relaxation between traditional latex elastics to different brands of non-latex elastics in a simulated saliva solution. The force relaxation of 6.35 mm (0.25 inch), 99 g (3.5 oz), non-colored latex elastics from Ormco Corp. and non-latex elastics from Phoenix Orthodontics, ClassOne Orthodontics, and Glenroe was tested. The elastics were stretched to 40 mm (1.57 inch) and the force produced by the elastics was then measured using a Mini 44 Instron machine.


RESULTS
The latex elastics had an initial relaxation of 15 percent after 1 hour of incubation and maintained their reduced force after 24 hours of incubation. Non-latex elastics lost approximately 20 percent of their force after the first hour and continued to lose force after up to 24 hours of incubation resulting in as much as 48 percent force relaxation.


CONCLUSION
Latex elastics should be used whenever possible; however, when non-latex elastics are warranted, the clinician should take into account their greater initial forces, significant force relaxation, and variability among brands.",2009,Texas dental journal
MÃ©rida solicita y logra la vuelta del Colegio Seminario de San Buenaventura (1821-1832),"The earthquake on March 26, 1812 and the recovery of power by the realist troops in that same year determined that the Dean of the cathedral, Licentiate Francisco Javier de Irastorza and the canon of mercy, Doctor Mateo Jose Mas y Rubi would request the transfer of the â€œReal Colegio Seminario de San Buenaventura de Meridaâ€ to Maracaibo in 1813 where it was established and approved with royal license under the name of â€œReal Colegio Seminario de San Fernando.â€ In 1821, the town hall in Merida requested to the Congress of Colombia that that ecclesiastic institute be reinstated to its city of origin. The Bishop Rafael Lasso de la Vega decisively intervened in this matter and the Seminary restarted its activities on the following year with classes on Philosophy, Latin and Greek Studies, Introduction to Theology, and other required classes with the aim of continuing to prepare the necessary amount of priests for the dioceses of Merida and Maracaibo. However, the seminary existed in that moment within the context of the Republic that was formed in 1821 under the name of Colombia where Venezuela was located. In that sense, this article will expose and analyze the facts that lead to the reinstatement of the â€œColegio Seminario Conciliar;â€ founded by Fray Juan Ramos de Lora as an educational house for young men who were inclined towards ecclesiastic studies on March 29, 1785; to Merida",2015,

"Phosphotriesterase activity in marine bacteria of the genera Phaeobacter, Ruegeria, and Thalassospira","Abstract Phosphate triester compounds are synthetic organophosphoric acids commonly used as plasticizers and pesticides. Despite their introduction in oceans through river water, the concentrations of phosphate triester compounds in coastal water are low, suggesting that they are naturally degraded by microorganisms. We here provide the first characterization of marine bacteria with enzymatic activities responsible for the degradation of a phosphate triester under coastal oceanic conditions. Bacterial strains belonging to Phaeobacter sp., Ruegeria mobilis , and Thalassospira profundimaris / tepidiphila showed the requisite phosphotriesterase activity for degradation of a phosphate triester (paraoxon-methyl). Further, Ruegeria sp. URN111 and Thalassospira sp. URN109 showed phosphodiesterase and phosphomonoesterase activities. These enzymatic activities of the marine bacteria appear to be lead to the release of phosphate from phosphate triesters. Considering the worldwide distribution of Ruegeria and Thalassospira , our findings suggest that the enzymatic/microbial degradation of phosphate triesters possibly occurs in coastal environments and may provide new material for the bioremediation of phosphate triesters.",2016,International Biodeterioration & Biodegradation
Studies in the econometrics of panel data with applications to,"The main objective of this thesis was to develop new methodologies that can inform researchers about some aspects of their model that are not informed by economic theory. To this end I have combined model selection features with more traditional panel data econometric models. The different methodologies are useful in different economic settings. I have shown the capabilities of each of the new methodologies by using them in specific economic questions with real data. In all of them I have obtained novel results that add to the different economic literatures. In the case of grouped patterns of heterogeneity I have studied the link between income and democracy of countries and found that the unobserved heterogeneity found among countries is consistent with Huntingtonâ€™s 3rd wave of democracy theories. In terms of recovering the structure of interactions I have shown how the methodology is able to uncover the structure of knowledge spillovers resulting from R&D investments among firms in the US. Finally, I have explored the suitability of the Epstein Zin model and found that there is evidence of overspecification. In what follows I summarize the conclusions reached for each of the methodologies, outline the main findings, and discuss future lines of research that I think are worth exploring.In Chapters 2 and 3 I have proposed, jointly with Stephane Bonhomme, the Grouped fixed-effects (GFE) framework, that offers a flexible yet parsimonious approach to model unobserved heterogeneity. The approach delivers estimates of common regression parameters, together with interpretable estimates of group-specific time patterns and group membership. The framework allows for strictly exogenous covariates and lagged outcomes. It also easily accommodates unit-specific fixed-effects in addition to the time-varying grouped patterns, and grouped heterogeneity in coefficients. Importantly, the relationship between group membership and observed covariates is left unrestricted. The GFE approach should be useful in applications where time-varying grouped effects may be present in the data. As a first example, the empirical analysis of the evolution of democracy shows evidence of a clustering of political regimes and transitions. More generally, GFE should be well-suited in difference-in-difference designs, as a way to relax parallel trend assumptions. Other potential applications include models of social interactions and spatial dependence where the reference groups or the spatial weights matrix are estimated from the panel data. The extension to nonlinear models is a natural next step. While it is possible to define GFE estimators in more general models (see for example equation (2.9)), the analysis raises statistical challenges. One area of applications is static or dynamic discrete choice modelling, where a discrete specification of unobserved heterogeneity may be appealing (Kasahara and Shimotsu, 2009, Browning and Carro, 2013). See Saggio (2012) for a first attempt in this direction. Lastly, another interesting extension is to relax the assumption that there is a finite number of well-separated groups in the population. As an alternative approach, one could view the grouped model as an approximation to the underlying data generating process, and characterize the statistical properties of GFE as the number of groups G increases with the two dimensions of the panel. In Chapter 4 I present a methodology to estimate both the structure of interactions and the spillover effects when the structure of interactions is not observable to the econometrician. This method is useful when the structure of interactions is sparse and persistent over time. Both of these assumptions can be partially relaxed: Sparsity can be relaxed by adding a priori information on the structure of interactions. Persistence over time can be relaxed by splitting the sample, parametrizing the spillover effects as a function of time, or by augmenting the number of regressors as explained in Appendix C.1. Spillovers arise when characteristics have an impact on the outcome of other individuals in the sample. This model is useful in at least two cases: First, in the context of randomized treatment experiments, when the treatment is subject to generate externalities. Second, in production function frameworks, where productivity generates spillovers. I propose a new estimator, the Pooled Lasso estimator, that can be seen as a panel data counterpart of the Lasso estimator. I provide an iterative computation method that combines the Lasso estimator with OLS pooled regression. Computation is fast, in relation to the large number of potential structures of interactions, given the global convex nature of the criterion. I analyze the properties of the Pooled Lasso estimator in a simplified model with no common parameters under assumptions of Gaussian and independent errors, both in the time and cross-sectional dimension. Based on a recent paper by Lam and Souza (2013), these strong conditions on the errors are likely to be relaxed. First, gaussianity can be replaced by conditions on the tail probability of errors. Second, limited time-series dependence can also be incorporated using Nagaev-type inequalities. Finally, mild cross-sectional dependence in the errors is also likely to be incorporated. I study the rate of convergence of cross-sectional spillover effects and, more generally, aggregate spillover effects. These quantities can be interpreted as relevant policy parameters depending on the application. Under conditions of cross-sectional independence on the error in estimation of the spillover effects, average spillover effects are estimated at a much better rate than individual spillover effects. Inference methods in the context of the Lasso are hard to derive due to the non-differentiability of the criterion. However, recent work in econometrics and statistics show good progress in this direction. For instance, Belloni et al.. (2013), show how to conduct inference in a post-lasso setting. That is, after using Lasso as a model selection devise, an ex-post OLS regression is run conditional on the estimated model. In particular, after using a Lasso-type estimator twice to select relevant controls in a treatment effect framework, they derive the asymptotic distribution of the treatment effect estimator and provide a formula for confidence intervals. One of the main features of their work is that, even in spite of imperfect model selection, their results hold uniformly for a large class of DGPs. Another recent work, by Lockhart et al., (2013) focus in developing a significance test of the predictor variable that enters the current lasso model, in the sequence of models visited along the lasso solution path of LARS (e.g. Efron et al., 2004). The Lasso solution path are the different solutions that the Lasso delivers when the penalty parameter decreases.",2015,
The quantile process under random censoring,"In this paper we discuss the asymptotic properties of quantile processes under random censoring. In contrast to most work in this area we prove weak convergence of an appropriately standardized quantile process under the assumption that the quantile regression model is only linear in the region, where the process is investigated. Additionally, we also discuss properties of the quantile process in sparse regression models including quantile processes obtained from the Lasso and adaptive Lasso. The results are derived by a combination of modern empirical process theory, classical martingale methods and a recent result of Kato (2009).",2012,Mathematical Methods of Statistics
Sparse alternatives to ridge regression: a random effects approach,"In a calibration of near-infrared (NIR) instrument, we regress some chemical compositions of interest as a function of their NIR spectra. In this process, we have two immediate challenges: first, the number of variables exceeds the number of observations and, second, the multicollinearity between variables are extremely high. To deal with the challenges, prediction models that produce sparse solutions have recently been proposed. The term â€˜sparseâ€™ means that some model parameters are zero estimated and the other parameters are estimated naturally away from zero. In effect, a variable selection is embedded in the model to potentially achieve a better prediction. Many studies have investigated sparse solutions for latent variable models, such as partial least squares and principal component regression, and for direct regression models such as ridge regression (RR). However, in the latter, it mainly involves an L1 norm penalty to the objective function such as lasso regression. In this study, we investigate new sparse alternative models for RR within a random effects model framework, where we consider Cauchy and mixture-of-normals distributions on the random effects. The results indicate that the mixture-of-normals model produces a sparse solution with good prediction and better interpretation. We illustrate the methods using NIR spectra datasets from milk and corn specimens.",2014,Journal of Applied Statistics

Biomaker patterns of fatty acids and other fat-soluble biocompounds in blood to indicate nuts intake in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study,"Summary Introduction Nuts are nutrient dense foods, rich in unsaturated fatty acids and other fat-soluble biocompounds. Epidemiological and intervention studies have shown that a high intake of nuts is associated with a reduced risk of coronary heart disease; however, inaccurate estimation of nut intake using self-reported methods might limit detection of other health benefits such as reduced risk of cancer, where potential strengths of associations are likely smaller. This study aimed to identify biomarker patterns including fatty acids (FAs) and other fat-soluble compounds (carotenoids and tocopherols) in blood to indicate nut intake by applying a statistical algorithm combining dimension reduction and variable selection methods. Methods The study included 2324 subjects (44% men) aged 35â€“70 years from 8 European countries in EPIC cross-sectional study. Recent and habitual nut intakes were assessed with 24-h dietary recalls (24-HDR) and dietary questionnaire (DQ), respectively. Potential biomarkers related to nut intake included 22 plasma FAs and serum fat-soluble compounds (7 carotenoids and 2 tocopherols). They were measured by gas chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography, respectively. In order to identify patterns of these biomarkers, maximizing the explained variability in nut intake, reduced rank regression (RRR) models were used with optimal subsets of biomarkers selected by two different variable selection methods; RRR-based variable importance in projection (RRR-VIP) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). Prior to the main analysis, nut intake and biomarker levels were log-transformed and adjusted for energy intake (nut intake only) and country taking residuals in linear models. The performance of RRR models was evaluated by Pearson correlation coefficients of biomarker pattern scores with recent and habitual nut intakes through internal two-fold cross-validation. Results Higher performance was observed in biomarker patterns on habitual nut intake reported in the DQ. The selected subsets of biomarkers slightly differed depending on which selection method was used, but arachidic acid, linoleic acid and tocopherols, known as abundant compounds in nuts, were commonly selected as biomarkers to explain habitual nut intake in both methods. Pearson correlation coefficients of biomarker pattern scores with habitual nut intake (rÂ =Â 0.27) were two to three times stronger than those of single biomarkers (linoleic acid rÂ =Â 0.08; arachidic acid rÂ =Â 0.11). Neither biomarker patterns nor single biomarkers performed well in explaining recent nut intake reported in the 24-HDR. Conclusions Biomarker patterns consisting of fatty acids or fat-soluble biocompounds better indicated nut intakes compared to any of these single biomarkers evaluated, especially for habitual nut intake. Whether these identified biomarker patterns improve assessment of nut intake in diet-disease studies needs to be evaluated in future studies.",2018,Revue D Epidemiologie Et De Sante Publique
Variable selection with the Lasso,"We use the Lasso, its adaptive or its thresholded variant, as procedure for variable selection. This essentially means that for \( {S_0}\,:=\,{\{j\,:{\beta^0_j}\neq 0\}} \) being the true active set, we look for a Lasso procedure delivering an estimator \( \hat{S}\) of \( {S_0}\) such that \( \hat{S}={S_0}\) with large probability. However, it is clear that very small coefficients \( \mid\beta^0_j\mid \) cannot be detected by any method. Moreover, irrepresentable conditions show that the Lasso, or any weighted variant, typically selects too many variables. In other words, unless one imposes very strong conditions, false positives cannot be avoided either. We shall therefore aim at estimators with oracle prediction error, yet having not too many false positives. The latter is considered as achieved when \( {\mid \hat{S}\backslash {S_*}\mid}=O({\mid {S_*}\mid})\), where \( {S_*}\,\subset \,{S_0}\) is the set of coefficients the oracle would select.We will show that the adaptive Lasso procedure, and also thresholding the initial Lasso, reaches this aim, assuming sparse eigenvalues, or alternatively, so-called â€œbeta-minâ€ conditions.",2011,
A cross-covariance based background subspace learning method for foreground detection,"Foreground detection in complex scenarios is a challenging task. In this work, we propose to detect foreground by incrementally learning a cross-covariance based subspace. In our method, we first introduce the cross-covariance based two dimensional principal component analysis (2DPCA) algorithm into foreground detection field for better background estimation. Then, we extend the conventional cross-covariance based 2DPCA algorithm into an incremental one, which helps to model background in an adaptive way. Moreover, we consider the sparse and the continuous characteristics of the foreground, and formulate them as a fused lasso problem. By adding the fused lasso regularization into the proposed subspace learning process, we integrate the background recovery and the foreground estimation into a single optimization framework. Finally, we design an efficient approximate algorithm which solves the optimization problem effectively. We compare our method with the state of the art methods on multiple challenging video sequences. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and the advantages of the proposed method.",2017,"2017 IEEE 2nd Information Technology, Networking, Electronic and Automation Control Conference (ITNEC)"
Common historical roots. Introduction to the special section on recapitulation theory and developmental psychology,"In 2014, the Governing Council of SRCD (Society for Research in Child Development) reinstituted the organizationâ€™s History Committee. This was based on a request of Willem Koops, who was nominated as chair of the oversight committee for the SRCDâ€™s Oral History Project (see its website for details), and who was supported in particular by Frank Kessel (2009; Bronfenbrenner, Kessel, Kessen, & White, 1986), a developmental psychologist who has occasionally engaged in historical scholarship, and by two historians interested in the history of developmental psychology, Marga Vicedo (2013) and Stephen Lassonde (2005; Mayes & Lassonde, 2014). Based in part on a workshop held at the Rockefeller Archive Center in late 2013 (see Sherrod, 2014), the History Committee has ambitious plans. In particular, it is planning a symposium in spring 2016 on developmental psychology and the history of childhood that will serve as the basis for a book on historical developmental psychology. The Committee also envisages organizing symposia at several international meetings. One major goal of such activities is to stimulate young scholars to investigate various intellectual and institutional dimensions of the complex sociocultural-political history of developmental psychology. The first activity of the History Committee took place in March 2015, at the SRCD Biennial Meeting in Philadelphia, in the form of a symposium on the nineteenth-century roots of developmental psychology. The particular focus of that session was the role of Haeckelâ€™s recapitulation theory at the end of the nineteenth century. The premise was, and is, that this theory played a decisive role on both sides of the Atlantic in setting the stage for the founding of the scientific discipline of developmental psychology. The subsequently written and edited symposium presentations comprise this special section. In the first paper, Willem Koops describes the European roots of child study and developmental psychology. He claims that after Prussia was defeated by Napoleon in 1806 (battle of Jena), German Romanticism was intensified, leading",2015,European Journal of Developmental Psychology
A prospective group sequential study evaluating a new type of fully covered self-expandable metal stent for the treatment of benign biliary strictures (with video).,"BACKGROUND
Fully-covered self expandable metal stents (fcSEMSs) are an alternative to progressive plastic stenting for the treatment of benign biliary strictures (BBS) with the prospect of a higher treatment efficacy and the need for fewer ERCPs, thereby reducing the burden for patients and possibly costs. Key to this novel treatment is safe stent removal.


OBJECTIVE
To investigate the feasibility and safety of stent removal of a fcSEMS with a proximal retrieval lasso: a long wire thread integrated in the proximal ends of the wire mesh that hangs freely in the stent lumen. Pulling it enables gradual removal of the stent inside-out. A secondary aim was success of stricture resolution.


DESIGN
Non-randomized, prospective follow-up study with 3 sequential cohorts of 8 patients with BBS.


SETTING
Academic tertiary referral center.


PATIENTS
Eligible patients had strictures either postsurgical (post-cholecystectomy (LCx) or liver transplantation (OLT)), due to chronic pancreatitis (CP), or papillary stenosis (PF). Strictures had to be located at least 2 cm below the liver hilum. All patients had one plastic stent in situ across the stricture and had not undergone previous treatment with either multiple plastic stents or fcSEMS.


INTERVENTIONS
The first cohort of patients underwent stent placement for 2 months, followed by 3 months if the stricture had not resolved. The second and third cohort started with 3 months and 4 months, respectively, both followed by another 4 months if indicated. Treatment success was defined by stricture resolution at cholangiography, the ability to pass an inflated extraction balloon and clinical follow-up (at least 6 months).


MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENT
safety of stent removal. Secondary outcomes were complications and successful stricture resolution.


RESULTS
A total of 23 patients (11 female; 20-67 yrs) were eligible for final analysis. One patient developed a malignant neuroendocrine tumor in the setting of CP. Strictures were caused by CP (13), OLT (6), LCx (3) and PF (1). In total 39 fcSEMS were placed and removed. Removals were easy and without complications. Transient pain after insertion was common (13 of 23/56%) but was easily managed by analgesics in all patients. Other complications were cholecystitis (1), cholangitis due to stent migration (1, stent replaced) or stent clogging (2, managed endoscopically) and worsening of CP (2). In these patients, the fcSEMS was removed and replaced after pancreatic sphincterotomy and PD stent placement. Median follow-up was 15 months (range 11-25). Overall treatment success was 61% (14/23); in the CP group 46%, in the remaining patients 80% (p = 0.11). Patients with stricture resolution after removal of the first stent (n = 7; success 6/7) showed a trent towards a more sustained treatment success than patients who needed a 2nd stent placement (n = 16; success 8/16); p = 0.12).


LIMITATIONS
Small number of patients with regard to secondary outcomes.


CONCLUSION
Removal of a new type of fcSEMS with a proximal retrieval lasso in patients with BBS proved easy and uncomplicated. Treatment success for CP strictures was higher compared to what is known from results of progressive plastic stenting protocols. For other indications treatment success was comparable to progressive plastic stenting, but with the prospect of fewer ERCP procedures.",2012,Gastrointestinal endoscopy
A Sparse Regression Method for Group-Wise Feature Selection with False Discovery Rate Control,"The method of Sorted L-One Penalized Estimation, or SLOPE, is a sparse regression method recently introduced by Bogdan et. al. [1] . It can be used to identify significant predictor variables in a linear model that may have more unknown parameters than observations. When the correlations between predictor variables are small, the SLOPE method is shown to successfully control the false discovery rate (the expected proportion of the irrelevant among all selected predictors) at a user specified level. However, the requirement for nearly uncorrelated predictors is too restrictive for genomic data, as demonstrated in our recent study [2] by an application of SLOPE to realistic simulated DNA sequence data. A possible solution is to divide the predictor variables into nearly uncorrelated groups, and to modify the procedure to select entire groups with an overall significant group effect, rather than individual predictors. Following this motivation, we extend SLOPE in the spirit of Group LASSO to Group SLOPE, a method that can handle group structures between the predictor variables, which are ubiquitous in real genomic data. Our theoretical results show that Group SLOPE controls the group-wise false discovery rate (gFDR), when groups are orthogonal to each other. For use in non-orthogonal settings, we propose two types of Monte Carlo based heuristics, which lead to gFDR control with Group SLOPE in simulations based on real SNP data. As an illustration of the merits of this method, an application of Group SLOPE to a dataset from the Framingham Heart Study results in the identification of some known DNA sequence regions associated with bone health, as well as some new candidate regions. The novel methods are implemented in the R package grpSLOPEMC , which is publicly available at https://github.com/agisga/grpSLOPEMC.",2018,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics

The DNA-DNA hybridization value for strain Eup-16T with T. montiporae CL-22T was less than 34â€‰%. Differential phenotypic properties, together with the phylogenetic inference, demonstrate that strain Eup-16T should be classified as a representative of a novel species of the genus Thalassotalea, for which the name Thalassotalea euphylliae sp. nov. is presented.

Model selection for high-dimensional data,"We investigate the task of model selection for high-dimensional data. For this purpose, we propose an extension to the Bayesian information criterion. Our information criterion is asymptotically consistent either as the number of measurements tends to infinity or as the variance of noise decreases to zero. The numerical results provided support our claim. Additionally, we highlight the link between model selection for high-dimensional data and the choice of hyper-parameter in â„“1-constrained estimators, specifically the LASSO.",2016,"2016 50th Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers"
Persistent severe acute respiratory distress syndrome for the prognostic enrichment of trials,"BACKGROUND
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is heterogeneous. As an indication of the heterogeneity of ARDS, there are patients whose syndrome improves rapidly (i.e., within 24 hours), others whose hypoxemia improves gradually and still others whose severe hypoxemia persists for several days. The latter group of patients with persistent severe ARDS poses challenges to clinicians. We attempted to assess the baseline characteristics and outcomes of persistent severe ARDS and to identify which variables are useful to predict it.


METHODS
A secondary analysis of patient-level data from the ALTA, EDEN and SAILS ARDSNet clinical trials was conducted. We defined persistent severe ARDS as a partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio (PaO2:FiO2) of equal to or less than 100 mmHg on the second study day following enrollment. Regularized logistic regression with an L1 penalty [Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO)] techniques were used to identify predictive variables of persistent severe ARDS.


RESULTS
Of the 1531 individuals with ARDS alive on the second study day after enrollment, 232 (15%) had persistent severe ARDS. Of the latter, 100 (43%) individuals had mild or moderate hypoxemia at baseline. Usage of vasopressors was greater [144/232 (62%) versus 623/1299 (48%); p<0.001] and baseline severity of illness was higher in patients with versus without persistent severe ARDS. Mortality at 60 days [95/232 (41%) versus 233/1299 (18%); p<0.001] was higher, and ventilator-free (p<0.001), intensive care unit-free [0 (0-14) versus 19 (7-23); p<0.001] and non-pulmonary organ failure-free [3 (0-21) versus 20 (1-26); p<0.001] days were fewer in patients with versus without persistent severe ARDS. PaO2:FiO2, FiO2, hepatic failure and positive end-expiratory pressure at enrollment were useful predictive variables.


CONCLUSIONS
Patients with persistent severe ARDS have distinct baseline characteristics and poor prognosis. Identifying such patients at enrollment may be useful for the prognostic enrichment of trials.",2020,PLoS ONE
Efficient sparse Hessian based algorithms for the clustered lasso problem,"We focus on solving the clustered lasso problem, which is a least squares problem with the $\ell_1$-type penalties imposed on both the coefficients and their pairwise differences to learn the group structure of the regression parameters. Here we first reformulate the clustered lasso regularizer as a weighted ordered-lasso regularizer, which is essential in reducing the computational cost from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n\log (n))$. We then propose an inexact semismooth Newton augmented Lagrangian (SSNAL) algorithm to solve the clustered lasso problem or its dual via this equivalent formulation, depending on whether the sample size is larger than the dimension of the features. An essential component of the SSNAL algorithm is the computation of the generalized Jacobian of the proximal mapping of the clustered lasso regularizer. Based on the new formulation, we derive an efficient procedure for its computation. Comprehensive results on the global convergence and local linear convergence of the SSNAL algorithm are established. For the purpose of exposition and comparison, we also summarize/design several first-order methods that can be used to solve the problem under consideration, but with the key improvement from the new formulation of the clustered lasso regularizer. As a demonstration of the applicability of our algorithms, numerical experiments on the clustered lasso problem are performed. The experiments show that the SSNAL algorithm substantially outperforms the best alternative algorithm for the clustered lasso problem.",2018,arXiv: Optimization and Control

"Thalassorhabdus aurantiaca gen. nov., sp. nov., a new member of the family Flavobacteriaceae isolated from seawater in South Korea","AbstractA novel Gram-negative, orange pigmented, strictly aerobic bacterium, designated strain IP9T, was isolated from seawater at the sea shore of Incheon Eulwang-ri beach, South Korea. Cells of strain IP9T were observed to be straight or slightly curved rods and colonies to be round and convex. Strain IP9T was found to be catalase and oxidase positive, and non-motile. Growth was observed in the temperature range of 10â€“37Â Â°C (optimum at 30Â Â°C), pH range of 6â€“10 (optimum at pH 7â€“8) and salt concentration range of 0â€“7% (w/v) NaCl (optimum at 0â€“1%). On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity and phylogenetic analysis, strain IP9T was found to be related to the members of the family Flavobacteriaceae, being closely related to Hwangdonia seohaensis KCTC 32177T (95.3% sequence similarity). The DNA Gâ€‰+â€‰C content of the novel strain was determined to be 39.1Â mol%. The major polar lipids were found to be phosphatidylethanolamine, three unidentified aminoglycolipids and two unidentified glycolipids. The major fatty acids (>â€‰10%) were identified as iso-C15:0 and iso-C17:0 3-OH. The predominant quinone was found to be menaquinone 6 (MK-6). Based on the biochemical, phylogenetic and physiological data, we conclude that strain IP9T (=â€‰KCTC 52523Tâ€‰=â€‰JCM 31732T) represents the type species of a novel genus of the family Flavobacteriaceae for which the name Thalassorhabdus aurantiaca gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed.

On Ising models and algorithms for the construction of symptom networks in psychopathological research.,"During the past 5 to 10 years, an estimation method known as eLasso has been used extensively to produce symptom networks (or, more precisely, symptom dependence graphs) from binary data in psychopathological research. The eLasso method is based on a particular type of Ising model that corresponds to binary pairwise Markov random fields, and its popularity is due, in part, to an efficient estimation process that is based on a series of lâ‚-regularized logistic regressions. In this article, we offer an unprecedented critique of the Ising model and eLasso. We provide a careful assessment of the conditions that underlie the Ising model as well as specific limitations associated with the eLasso estimation algorithm. This assessment leads to serious concerns regarding the implementation of eLasso in psychopathological research. Some potential strategies for eliminating or, at least, mitigating these concerns include (a) the use of partitioning or mixture modeling to account for unobserved heterogeneity in the sample of respondents, and (b) the use of co-occurrence measures for symptom similarity to either replace or supplement the covariance/correlation measure associated with eLasso. Two psychopathological data sets are used to highlight the concerns that are raised in the critique. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved).",2019,Psychological methods
Image morphing using deformation and patch-based synthesis,"Image morphing creates a smooth transformation between images. Traditional morphing techniques may fail when the two input images have large displacements. In this paper, a two-step scheme is proposed to deal with this challenging task. Firstly, a series of deformed images is generated through optimizing an adaptation of deformation objective that composed of as-rigid-as-possible energy, group lasso penalty, and smoothness penalty. Then, the forward and backward deformed sequences are aligned utilizing the patch-based synthesis, satisfying source similarity and temporal coherence. Guided by a few user-specified correspondences, the proposed method works well in many morphing scenes.",2017,"2017 2nd International Conference on Image, Vision and Computing (ICIVC)"
Behavior of Lasso and Lasso-based inference under limited variability,"We study the nonasymptotic behavior of Lasso and Lasso-based inference when the covariates exhibit limited variability, which does not appear to have been considered in the literature, despite its prevalence in applied research. In settings that are generally considered favorable to Lasso, we show that, if the absolute value of a nonzero regression coefficient is smaller or equal to a threshold, Lasso fails to select the corresponding covariate with high probability (approaching to 1 asymptotically). In particular, limited variability can render Lasso unable to select even those covariates with coefficients that are well-separated from zero. Moreover, based on simple theoretical examples, we show that post double Lasso and debiased Lasso can exhibit size distortions under limited variability. Monte Carlo simulations corroborate our theoretical results and further demonstrate that, under limited variability, the performance of Lasso and Lasso-based inference methods is very sensitive to the choice of the penalty parameter. This begs the question of how to make statistical inference (e.g., constructing confidence intervals) under limited variability. In moderately high-dimensional problems, where the number of covariates is large but still smaller than the sample size, OLS constitutes a natural alternative to Lasso-based inference methods. In empirically relevant settings, our simulation results show that, under limited variability, OLS with recently developed standard errors, which are proven robust to many covariates, demonstrates a superior finite sample performance relative to Lasso-based inference methods.",2019,arXiv: Statistics Theory
Sub-region based radiomics analysis for survival prediction in oesophageal tumours treated by definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy,"BACKGROUND
Evaluating clinical outcome prior to concurrent chemoradiotherapy remains challenging for oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) as traditional prognostic markers are assessed at the completion of treatment. Herein, we investigated the potential of using sub-region radiomics as a novel tumour biomarker in predicting overall survival of OSCC patients treated by concurrent chemoradiotherapy.


METHODS
Independent patient cohorts from two hospitals were included for training (nâ€¯=â€¯87) and validation (n =â€¯46). Radiomics features were extracted from sub-regions clustered from patients' tumour regions using K-means method. The LASSO regression for 'Cox' method was used for feature selection. The survival prediction model was constructed based on the sub-region radiomics features using the Cox proportional hazards model. The clinical and biological significance of radiomics features were assessed by correlation analysis of clinical characteristics and copy number alterations(CNAs) in the validation dataset.


FINDINGS
The overall survival prediction model combining with seven sub-regional radiomics features was constructed. The C-indexes of the proposed model were 0.729 (0.656-0.801, 95% CI) and 0.705 (0.628-0.782, 95%CI) in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. The 3-year survival receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed an area under the ROC curve of 0.811 (0.670-0.952, 95%CI) in training and 0.805 (0.638-0.973, 95%CI) in validation. The correlation analysis showed a significant correlation between radiomics features and CNAs.


INTERPRETATION
The proposed sub-regional radiomics model could predict the overall survival risk for patients with OSCC treated by definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy.

Medicine discrimination of NIRS based on a regularized collaborative representation identification with the gabor optimizer,"Abstract Counterfeit medicines, which adversely affect patientsâ€™ health and lives, are widespread. Therefore, discriminating between genuine and counterfeit medication is becoming a critical concern. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a popular and effective technique that has nondestructive characteristics and is used for medicine identification. To discriminate between genuine and counterfeit medicines, a sparse signal representation model is established in the presence of spectrum crossover and overlapping. However, the sparsity of nonzero representation coefficients is low when solving L 2 -norm in the representation model. To overcome this problem, a novel identification model, called regularized collaborative representation identification with the Gabor optimizer (RCRCG), is proposed in this paper. A Gabor filter is adopted to control L 2 -norm for the more relevant factor vectors. Then, Lasso regulation on local identification is used to improve the accuracy of medicine discrimination. The results of experiments using NIRS samples from three datasets (with the use of erythromycin ethylsuccinate and domperidone as active substances) show that the proposed method is more effective and robust than the existing methods and its speed is twice that of the Sparse Representation-based Classification (SRC) and Class L 1 -optimizer classifier with the closeness rule (C_CL1C).",2019,Optik

A reappraisal of the chemical and physical defenses of Caribbean gorgonian corals against predatory fishes,"Anti-predatory properties of crude organic extracts and calcitic sclerites from the tissues of 32 species of Caribbean gorgonians were examined at natural volumetric concentrations in labo- ratory feeding assays using the bluehead wrasse Thalassoma bifasciatum. The nutritional qualities of the gorgonian samples were analyzed by determination of protein content, total energy content, and ash mass. All of the species tested (100%) yielded predation-deterrent crude organic extracts, but the sclerites of only 2 species (6.3%), Pterogorgia citrina and the encrusting form of Briareum asbestinum, were deterrent. The mean NaOH-soluble protein content, total energy content and ash mass of the gorgonian species were 17 Â± 8 mg ml -1 , 4 Â± 2 kJ ml -1 , and 400 Â± 100 mg ml -1 , respectively. There was no apparent relationship between the nutritional quality of a species and its chemical or physical defense. Contrary to previous studies, results indicated that sclerites do not generally afford gorgonians protection against generalist fish predators, and there was no evidence that the presence of sclerites in gorgonian tissue decreases the nutritional value sufficiently to deter predation. As in sponges, secondary metabolites are the primary means of defense against fish predators for Caribbean gorgonians. Results confirm that feeding assays conducted on the basis of tissue volume yield different results than those conducted on the basis of tissue mass.",2002,Marine Ecology Progress Series
The Artful Mythographer: Roberto Calasso and The Marriage of Cadmus and Harmony,"When Roberto Calasso's retelling of the myths of Ancient Greece, Le nozze di Cadmo e Armon?a,1 was first reviewed for the Times Literary Supplement, it was as a work of modern Italian fiction. As such, it left the re viewer in a state of some perplexity: ""We read on unsure of whether the primary purpose of the book is a truth-telling one or an aesthetic one. Are we listening to someone ex pounding what he believes to be the ""truth"" about Greek civilization ... or are we listening to something ... that uses mythology for its own gorgeous, and . . . baroque effects?""2 Dick Davis considered a series of potential models for Ca lasso's work from Monteverdi to Mario Praz, but was ulti mately unable to come to terms with Calasso's attempt to produce both ""a work of exegesis and an aesthetic adven ture.'^ Four years later, Calasso's work found itself once again within the review pages of the Times Literary Supplement, this time translated into English as The Marriage of Cadmus and Harmony A In its new form, it was now reviewed, not as Italian fiction, but as a work of classical mythography. Mary Beard did not share Davis' anxieties about the relationship between truth-telling and aesthetics. 5 For her, as for other classicist reviewers,6 it was natural to place Calasso in the long tradition of writers, starting with Homer and Hesiod, who used myth both to entertain and to instruct. In this way, Calasso could be understood quite naturally as ""Greek myth in a late twentieth-century guise, Greek myth for a modern imagination.

The goals of the surgery were total tumor removal with minimal morbidity. All patients underwent preoperative embolization to reduce hemorrhage during tumor resection. The intracranial extension was next managed via a suboccipital craniotomy. Once the temporal bone portion of the tumor was reached, a fascia/acrylic barrier was applied to the medial aspect of the tumor. Three to six weeks postoperatively, the mastoidectomy-neck portion of the dissection was undertaken for total tumor removal.

Identifying Children With Clinical Language Disorder: An Application of Machine-Learning Classification,"In this study, we identified child- and family-level characteristics most strongly associated with clinical identification of language disorder for preschool-aged children. We used machine learning to identify variables that best classified children receiving therapy for language disorder among a sample of 483 3- to 5-year-old children (54% affected). Using a dichotomous outcome based on receipt of language therapy, we applied the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) classification approach to a range of background data available on the children, including teacher and caregiver ratings of communication and social skills. The sample was randomly split into a training (67% of children) and test sample (33% of children) to examine out-of-sample classification accuracy. The full model had excellent classification accuracy based on area under the curve (AUC) of .87 and .85 on the training and test sets, respectively, when utilizing all available background data. Variables most strongly contributing to accurate classification of language-therapy receipt were cognitive impairment, age, gender, and teacher- and parent-reported communication, social, and literacy skills. Use of machine-learning approaches to classify children receiving language services in school settings may provide a valuable approach for identifying those factors that best differentiate children with and without language disorders from a clinical perspective.",2019,Journal of Learning Disabilities
Sparsity and Stability for Minimum-Variance Portfolios,"The popularity of modern portfolio theory has decreased among practitioners because of its unfavorable out-of-sample performance. Estimation errors tend to affect the optimal weight calculation noticeably, especially when a large number of assets is considered. To overcome these issues, many methods have been proposed in recent years, although most only address a small set of practically relevant questions related to portfolio allocation. This study therefore sheds light on different covariance estimation techniques, combines them with sparse model approaches, and includes a turnover constraint that induces stability. We use two datasets - comprising 319 and 100 companies of the S&P 500, respectively - to create a realistic and reproducible data foundation for our empirical study. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to show that it is possible to maintain the low-risk profile of efficient estimation methods while automatically selecting only a subset of assets and further inducing low portfolio turnover. Moreover, we provide evidence that using the LASSO as the sparsity-generating model is insufficient to lower turnover when the involved tuning parameter can change over time.",2019,arXiv: Portfolio Management
Non-citizen commemoration in fifth and fourth century BC Attica,"The present thesis is an iconographic study of funerary monuments that memorialise, votive reliefs that include and decree reliefs that honour non-citizens resident in Attica or involved with Athens in the course of the fifth and fourth centuries BC. Non-citizens here include metics (free resident foreigners), slaves, and foreigners. Collected together in this thesis are 173 funerary monuments, 34 epigraphic attestations of non-citizens dedicating, 65 votive reliefs that include non-citizens, and 60 decree reliefs. 
While non-citizens were marginalised legally and politically, they contributed to Athenian society and Athensâ€™ position in the wider Greek world and their presence in the commemorative landscape was part of their contribution. This thesis employs and expands the â€˜free spacesâ€™ paradigm adapted by Kostas Vlassopoulos (2007), which envisions certain spaces in Athens as facilitating shared experiences between citizens and non-citizens that created shared identities. It argues that the cemeteries and sanctuaries of Attica were, when it came to commemoration, â€˜free spacesâ€™ traversed by both citizens and non-citizens, and that a shared iconography was created and used by citizens and non-citizens alike that both reflected their shared experiences and identities and contributed to those shared experiences and identities.",2018,
Variable selection in the accelerated failure time model via the bridge method,"In high throughput genomic studies, an important goal is to identify a small number of genomic markers that are associated with development and progression of diseases. A representative example is microarray prognostic studies, where the goal is to identify genes whose expressions are associated with disease free or overall survival. Because of the high dimensionality of gene expression data, standard survival analysis techniques cannot be directly applied. In addition, among the thousands of genes surveyed, only a subset are disease-associated. Gene selection is needed along with estimation. In this article, we model the relationship between gene expressions and survival using the accelerated failure time (AFT) models. We use the bridge penalization for regularized estimation and gene selection. An efficient iterative computational algorithm is proposed. Tuning parameters are selected using V-fold cross validation. We use a resampling method to evaluate the prediction performance of bridge estimator and the relative stability of identified genes. We show that the proposed bridge estimator is selection consistent under appropriate conditions. Analysis of two lymphoma prognostic studies suggests that the bridge estimator can identify a small number of genes and can have better prediction performance than the Lasso.",2010,Lifetime Data Analysis
Classification of high dimensional data using LASSO ensembles,"The estimation of multivariable predictors with good performance in high dimensional settings is a crucial task in biomedical contexts. Usually, solutions based on the application of a single machine learning model are provided while the use of ensemble methods is often overlooked within this area despite the well-known benefits that these methods provide in terms of predictive performance. In this paper, four ensemble approaches are described using LASSO base learners to predict the vital status of a patient from RNA-Seq gene expression data. The results of the analysis carried out in a public breast invasive cancer (BRCA) dataset shows that the ensemble approaches outperform statistically significant the standard LASSO model considered as baseline case. We also perform an analysis of the computational costs involved for each of the approaches, providing different usage recommendations according to the available computational power.",2017,2017 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (SSCI)
Augmented Bayesian Compressive Sensing,"The simultaneous sparse approximation problem is concerned with recovering a set of multichannel signals that share a common support pattern using incomplete or compressive measurements. Multichannel modifications of greedy algorithms like orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP), as well as convex mixed-norm extensions of the Lasso, have typically been deployed for efficient signal estimation. While accurate recovery is possible under certain circumstances, it has been established that these methods may all fail in regimes where traditional subspace techniques from array processing, notably the MUSIC algorithm, can provably succeed. Against this backdrop several recent hybrid algorithms have been developed that merge a subspace estimation step with OMP-like procedures to obtain superior results, sometimes with theoretical guarantees. In contrast, this paper considers a completely different approach built upon Bayesian compressive sensing. In particular, we demonstrate that minor modifications of standard Bayesian algorithms can naturally obtain the best of both worlds backed with theoretical and empirical support, surpassing the performance of existing hybrid MUSIC and convex simultaneous sparse approximation algorithms, especially when poor RIP conditions render alternative approaches ineffectual.",2015,2015 Data Compression Conference
Parameter Estimation and Filtering Using Sparse Modeling,"Sparsity-based estimation techniques deal with the problem of retrieving a data vector from an undercomplete set of linear observations, when the data vector is known to have few nonzero elements with unknown positions. It is also known as the atomic decomposition problem, and has been carefully studied in the field of compressed sensing. Recent findings have led to a method called basis pursuit, also known as Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), as a numerically reliable sparsity-based approach. Although the atomic decomposition problem is generally NP-hard, it has been shown that basis pursuit may provide exact solutions under certain assumptions. This has led to an extensive study of signals with sparse representation in different domains, providing a new general insight into signal processing. This thesis further investigates the role of sparsity-based techniques, especially basis pursuit, for solving parameter estimation problems. The relation between atomic decomposition and parameter estimation problems under a so-called separable model has also led to the application of basis pursuit to these problems. Although simulation results suggest a desirable trend in the behavior of parameter estimation by basis pursuit, a satisfactory analysis is still missing. The analysis of basis pursuit has been found difficult for several reasons, also related to its implementation. The role of the regularization parameter and discretization are common issues. Moreover, the analysis of estimates with a variable order, in this case, is not reducible to multiple fixed-order analysis. In addition to implementation and analysis, the Bayesian aspects of basis pursuit and combining prior information have not been thoroughly discussed in the context of parameter estimation. In the research presented in this thesis, we provide methods to overcome the above difficulties in implementing basis pursuit for parameter estimation. In particular, the regularization parameter selection problem and the so-called off-grid effect is addressed. We develop numerically stable algorithms to avoid discretization and study homotopy-based solutions for complex-valued problems. We use our continuous estimation algorithm, as a framework to analyze the basis pursuit. Moreover, we introduce finite set based mathematical tools to perform the analysis. Finally, we study the Bayesian aspects of basis pursuit. In particular, we introduce and study a recursive Bayesian filter for tracking the sparsity pattern in a variable parameter estimation setup.",2015,
Motor Imagery ECoG Signal Classification Using Sparse Representation with Elastic Net Constraint,"In recent years, the brain-computer interface (BCI) technology based on the motor imagery has provided a new method for people to communicate with the outside world. How to effectively extract features and improve the recognition rate of EEG signals is one of the hot problems in this field. This study is based on the motor imagery ECoG signals, in which the common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm is used for feature extraction, and then the extracted energy features are classified by the classification algorithms. In order to improve the classification accuracy of the ECoG signals, this study introduces the sparse representation-based classification (SRC) algorithm with the elastic network constraint. Then the accelerated proximal gradient (APG) algorithm and the least angle regression (LARS) algorithm are respectively applied to sparse coding for the ECoG signals. The elastic network which combines the L1 norm and the L2 norm not only avoids the over-fitting problem, but also has a higher prediction ability than the Lasso algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve better classification performance than other algorithms, such as the sparse representation algorithms with L1 minimization, SVM, KNN, Adaboost, and Naive Bayes.",2018,2018 IEEE 7th Data Driven Control and Learning Systems Conference (DDCLS)
Abstract 2738: Early detection of colorectal cancer applying a combination of serum markers,"Background: Fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) is the recommended first line screening for the detection of colorectal cancer (CRC). To improve the detection of CRC we evaluated serum markers and combinations of serum markers as an alternative approach. Methods: Applying Lasso Regression, a specialized form of penalized logistic regression, we selected six markers for an evaluation in a collective of 857 patients including 301 CRC patients, 143 patients with adenoma, 266 healthy controls and 147 disease controls. For each marker and marker combination the performance was assessed. Results: We tested a total of 22 biomarkers for the detection of CRC from serum. Of these six markers were selected for a marker combination by Lasso Regression. Included were the well-known tumor markers CEA and CYFRA21-1 as well as novel markers or markers that are less routinely used for the detection of CRC: ferritin, osteopontin, anti-p53 and seprase. CEA showed the best sensitivity of all markers with 43.9 % at 95% specificity, followed by seprase (42.4%), CYFRA21-1 (35.5%), osteopontin (30.2%), ferritin (23.9%) and anti-p53 (20.0%). When these markers were combined a sensitivity of 72.3% was reached at a corresponding specificity of 95% and of 62.1% at 98% specificity. Focusing on more screening relevant stages, UICC stages 0-III, reduced the sensitivity slightly to 68.0% and 53.3%, respectively. In a sub-collective where matched stool samples were available (75 CRC cases and 234 controls) the sensitivity of the marker combination was comparable to fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) with 82.4% and 68.9% vs. 81.8% and 72.7% at 95% and 98% specificity, respectively. Conclusion: When six markers were combined to detect CRC from serum, the combination reached a performance that was comparable to FIT. This provides a novel tool for CRC screening to trigger a follow-up colonoscopy for a final diagnosis. Citation Format: {Authors}. {Abstract title} [abstract].

Study of model evaluation method and of selection method of tuning parameter in Lasso,"High-dimensional data sets have been used extensively in recent years. However, their use is computationally expensive, and model features are difficult to capture. Thus, it is necessary to construct a simple and appropriate model. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) can estimate several regression coefficients as exactly zero, making it possible to estimate a model and select variables at the same time. However, several problems exist. The decision procedure for the tuning parameter, which is the coefficient of the penalty term, is not established, and it is difficult to determine the value of the estimated model. In this paper, we consider a model evaluation method and a selection method for the tuning parameter. We investigate selection methods for the most appropriate tuning parameter and model evaluation methods using the model evaluation indexes RSS, AIC, BIC, and Mallowsâ€™s Cp. Let several regression coefficients be zero and vary the number of zeroes. Then, we observe the performances of the evaluation indexes. Furthermore, we observe their performances when the values of the regression coefficients are close to zero and confirm them by simulation.",2016,
Eagle Owl (Bubo bubo) Pellets from Roman Sagalassos (SW Turkey): Distinguishing the Prey Remains from Nest and Roost Sites,"Two concentrations of animal bones, almost exclusively from small mammals and wild birds, were found within the destruction debris of a Roman bath complex in Sagalassos (SW Turkey). The overall species spectrum, skeletal element representation, fragmentation and preservation condition of the bones indicate that they represent the prey remains of a large nocturnal avian predator, more precisely the eagle owl (Bubo bubo). Differences in skeletal element representation and in prey species' spectrum show that the two bone clusters derive from pellets deposited near a nest site and a roost site, respectively. Radiocarbon dates obtained from the bones indicate that eagle owls lived in the collapsing bath complex during the second half of the 6th to the beginning of the 7th century AD, before the final abandonment of the town. The MNI of the prey animals found at the nest site, confronted with the daily dietary needs of a female eagle owl and its young, indicates repetitive use of the same place during several years.

2DPCA with L1-norm for simultaneously robust and sparse modelling,"Robust dimensionality reduction is an important issue in processing multivariate data. Two-dimensional principal component analysis based on L1-norm (2DPCA-L1) is a recently developed technique for robust dimensionality reduction in the image domain. The basis vectors of 2DPCA-L1, however, are still dense. It is beneficial to perform a sparse modelling for the image analysis. In this paper, we propose a new dimensionality reduction method, referred to as 2DPCA-L1 with sparsity (2DPCAL1-S), which effectively combines the robustness of 2DPCA-L1 and the sparsity-inducing lasso regularization. It is a sparse variant of 2DPCA-L1 for unsupervised learning. We elaborately design an iterative algorithm to compute the basis vectors of 2DPCAL1-S. The experiments on image data sets confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",2013,Neural networks : the official journal of the International Neural Network Society
Two New Milestones from Pisidia,"By the end of 1987 three successive seasons had been spent by a team co-directed by Dr. S. Mitchell and Professor M. Waelkens at the Augustan colony of Cremna, and two (plus a brief initial season in 1985) at Pisidia's chief city in Roman Imperial times, Sagalassos. The permit for a surface survey has provided the opportunity to locate and check a considerable percentage of the texts previously known. It has also made possible the discovery of several new inscriptions from these sites and their territory. Two new milestones are presented here, one pertaining to each city. In early August 1987, on the last evening of my stay with the team working at Sagalassos, I was taken by two men from AÇ§lasun 4 km. along the AÇ§lasunâ€“Isparta road. Turning right into a lane, after some 300 m. we came to a small bridge over a stream. Nearby was a large cylindrical stone (Pl. XVII( a )) which had recently been recovered from the stream during excavations for another bridge.",1989,Anatolian studies
High Dimensional Robust Inference for Cox Regression Models,"We consider high-dimensional inference for potentially misspecified Cox proportional hazard models based on low dimensional results by Lin and Wei [1989]. A de-sparsified Lasso estimator is proposed based on the log partial likelihood function and shown to converge to a pseudo-true parameter vector. Interestingly, the sparsity of the true parameter can be inferred from that of the above limiting parameter. Moreover, each component of the above (non-sparse) estimator is shown to be asymptotically normal with a variance that can be consistently estimated even under model misspecifications. In some cases, this asymptotic distribution leads to valid statistical inference procedures, whose empirical performances are illustrated through numerical examples.",2018,arXiv: Statistics Theory
Evaluating Variable Selection Techniques for Multivariate Linear Regression,"The purpose of variable selection techniques is to select a subset of relevant variables for a particular learning algorithm in order to improve the accuracy of prediction model and improve the efficiency of the model. We conduct an empirical analysis to evaluate and compare seven well-known variable selection techniques for multiple linear regression model, which is one of the most commonly used regression model in practice. The variable selection techniques we apply are forward selection, backward elimination, stepwise selection, genetic algorithm (GA), ridge regression, lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) and elastic net. Based on the experiment with 49 regression data sets, it is found that GA resulted in the lowest error rates while lasso most significantly reduces the number of variables. In terms of computational efficiency, forward/backward elimination and lasso requires less time than the other techniques.",2016,

A Comparison of Penalized Regressions for Estimating Directed Acyclic Networks,"Network models can be classified into two large groups: undirected and directed. Directed network graphs that can represent causal relationships are likely more appropriate in bio-medical data.

A multi-locus assessment of connectivity and historical demography in the bluehead wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum),"The pelagic larval stage of most coral reef fishes might allow extensive dispersal or, alternatively, some level of local recruitment might be important. Molecular markers can be used to obtain indirect estimates of dispersal to evaluate these alternatives, yet the extent of gene flow among populations is known for only a small number of species. The use of such markers must take into account the properties of the markers and the demographic history of the population when making inferences about current gene flow. In the Caribbean bluehead wrasse, Thalassoma bifasciatum, previous studies have found both substantial levels of local recruitment, in studies interpreting otolith microchemistry and, conversely, a lack of genetic differentiation inferred from mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) restriction-fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) data and allozymes. However, if subtle differentiation exists, larger sample sizes and highly variable markers may be required to discern it. Here we present results from mitochondrial control region sequence and microsatellite data that indicate a lack of genetic differentiation at both small and large spatial scales. However, historical processes, such as changes in population size, may have affected the current distribution of genetic variation.",2007,Heredity
SÃ©lection de variables pour la classification non supervisÃ©e en grande dimension,"Il existe des situations de modelisation statistique pour lesquelles le probleme classique de classification non supervisee (c'est-a-dire sans information a priori sur la nature ou le nombre de classes a constituer) se double d'un probleme d'identification des variables reellement pertinentes pour determiner la classification. Cette problematique est d'autant plus essentielle que les donnees dites de grande dimension, comportant bien plus de variables que d'observations, se multiplient ces dernieres annees : donnees d'expression de genes, classification de courbes... Nous proposons une procedure de selection de variables pour la classification non supervisee adaptee aux problemes de grande dimension. Nous envisageons une approche par modeles de melange gaussien, ce qui nous permet de reformuler le probleme de selection des variables et du choix du nombre de classes en un probleme global de selection de modele. Nous exploitons les proprietes de selection de variables de la regularisation l1 pour construire efficacement, a partir des donnees, une collection de modeles qui reste de taille raisonnable meme en grande dimension. Nous nous demarquons des procedures classiques de selection de variables par regularisation l1 en ce qui concerne l'estimation des parametres : dans chaque modele, au lieu de considerer l'estimateur Lasso, nous calculons l'estimateur du maximum de vraisemblance. Ensuite, nous selectionnons l'un des ces estimateurs du maximum de vraisemblance par un critere penalise non asymptotique base sur l'heuristique de pente introduite par Birge et Massart. D'un point de vue theorique, nous etablissons un theoreme de selection de modele pour l'estimation d'une densite par maximum de vraisemblance pour une collection aleatoire de modeles. Nous l'appliquons dans notre contexte pour trouver une forme de penalite minimale pour notre critere penalise. D'un point de vue pratique, des simulations sont effectuees pour valider notre procedure, en particulier dans le cadre de la classification non supervisee de courbes. L'idee cle de notre procedure est de n'utiliser la regularisation l1 que pour constituer une collection restreinte de modeles et non pas aussi pour estimer les parametres des modeles. Cette etape d'estimation est realisee par maximum de vraisemblance. Cette procedure hybride nous est inspiree par une etude theorique menee dans une premiere partie dans laquelle nous etablissons des inegalites oracle l1 pour le Lasso dans les cadres de regression gaussienne et de melange de regressions gaussiennes, qui se demarquent des inegalites oracle l0 traditionnellement etablies par leur absence totale d'hypothese.",2012,
Micro-architectural Features for Malware Detection,"As the variety and complexity of attacks continue to increase, software-based malware detection can impose significant performance overhead. Recent works have demonstrated the feasibility of malware detection using hardware performance counters. Therefore, equipping a malware detector to collect and analyze micro-architecture features of CPUs to recognize malware at running time has become a promising method. In comparison to the software-based malware detection, hardware-based malware detection not only reduces the cost of system performance, but also possesses better detection capacity. However, hundreds of micro-architecture events can be monitored by hardware performance counters (HPCs) which are widely available in prevailing CPUs, such as Intel, ARM and so on. In this paper, we take Intel ivy bridge i3 processor as an example and examine most of these micro-architectural features. Instead of relying on experience, the Lasso algorithm is employed to reduce the dimensionality of feature vector to 6 elements. Furthermore, 4 classification methods based on supervised learning are applied for the selected features. We improve the classification accuracy rate of 15 % on average. The results show that the micro-architectural features of this paper can reveal the behaviors of malware better.",2016,

A propos d'une sÃ©rie de cas,"L'interet de l'endoscopie dans la resection des polypes colorectaux a ete rapporte dans plusieurs etudes. Les techniques de resection endoscopique sont multiples et maitrisees dans les pays occidentaux. La technique de mucosectomie endoscopique et celle de la pose d'une anse largable en nylon (endoloop) ont elargi le champ des lesions resecables par endoscopie. Toutefois, malgre cette evolution, la vulgarisation de la polypectomie n'est pas effective.

Bayesian Non-Linear Methods for Survival Analysis and Structural Equation Models,"High dimensional complex data are very common nowadays due to the technological advancement in the field of the computer science, biology, and medicine. Modeling non-linear structures in complex data and selecting the important variables or signals in a high dimensional data is a very fundamental problem in the field of statistics. In this dissertation we have developed a Bayesian kernel machine model which can incorporate existing information on pathways and gene networks in the analysis of DNA microarray data. Each pathway is modeled nonparametrically using reproducing kernel Hilbert space. The pathways and the genes are selected via assigning mixture priors on the pathway indicator variables and the gene indicator variables. This approach provides us with a flexible modeling of the pathway effects, which can capture both linear and non-linear effects. Moreover, the model can also pinpoint the important pathways and the important active genes within each pathway. As an extension to the pathway modeling, we apply the Bayesian Graph Laplacian Model which can find out the underlying gene network structure for a given set of genes. This is particularly useful when we have a set of variables or genes and we want to find out how they are connected among themselves based on a particular data. The utility and the effectiveness of our model are established by several simulation studies and real data analysis. We extend the idea of semiparametric structural equation model where the nonlinear functional relationships are approximated using basis expansions [Guo et al., 2012]. Many basis expansion methods, including cubic splines, are known to induce correlations. In this chapter, we compare standard Lasso, Fused Lasso and Elastic Net to account for correlations in both the covariate and basis expansions. To illustrate the usefulness of the proposed methods, a simulation study and a real data study have been performed. The semiparametric structural equation models based on Bayesian fused Lasso and Bayesian elastic-net outperform the Bayesian Lasso model.",2014,

Penalized methods in genome-wide association studies,"Penalized regression methods are becoming increasingly popular in genomewide association studies (GWAS) for identifying genetic markers associated with disease. However, standard penalized methods such as the LASSO do not take into account the possible linkage disequilibrium between adjacent markers. We propose a novel penalized approach for GWAS using a dense set of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The proposed method uses the minimax concave penalty (MCP) for marker selection and incorporates linkage disequilibrium (LD) information by penalizing the difference of the genetic effects at adjacent SNPs with high correlation. A coordinate descent algorithm is derived to implement the proposed method. This algorithm is efficient and stable in dealing with a large number of SNPs. A multi-split method is used to calculate the p-values of the selected SNPs for assessing their significance. We refer to the proposed penalty function as the smoothed minimax concave penalty (SMCP) and the proposed approach as the SMCP method. Performance of the proposed SMCP method and its comparison with a LASSO approach are evaluated through simulation studies, which demonstrate that the proposed method is more accurate in selecting associated SNPs. Its applicability to real data is illustrated using data from a GWAS on rheumatoid arthritis. Based on the idea of SMCP, we propose a new penalized method for group variable selection in GWAS with respect to the correlation between adjacent groups. The proposed method uses the group LASSO for encouraging group sparsity and a",2011,
Integrating Multiâ€element Geochemical and Magnetic Survey at Ancient Sagalassos (Southwest Turkey): Anthropogenic Versus Natural Anomalies,"Several studies in the field of archaeological prospection have suggested that multi-element soil geochemical survey holds potential as an archaeological survey method, complementing more common techniques such as magnetometry and fieldwalking. Despite this, only limited research regarding this topic has been carried out. In this study, a geochemical survey was conducted in the Eastern Suburbium of the Roman to Byzantine city of Sagalassos, with the aim of investigating the possibilities and limitations of the technique in facilitating the interpretation of magnetic survey data. To explore the multivariate patterns present within the chemical dataset, the data were statistically analysed using a contiguity-constrained spatial clustering algorithm. The resulting spatial clusters revealed that an area characterized by high-frequency magnetic anomalies was spatially associated with a chemical cluster rich in Cu, K, P, Pb and Zn. This is interpreted as resulting from the accumulation and decomposition of occupational debris. Enhancements of Al, As and Ba helped to interpret an area with a low magnetic signal as a region where limestone bedrock was located close to the soil surface. Finally, two zones of enhanced magnetization were shown to spatially overlap with two clusters of soils containing elevated levels of Co, Cr, Mg, Mn, Ni and (Fe) and Ti, V and (Fe), respectively, indicating the presence of two different types of mafic to ultramafic ophiolitic bedrock near the soil surface. This study confirms that multi-element geochemistry has potential as a survey technique, because it offers direct information on soil bedrock or ancient human disturbance, thereby adding an extra dimension to the interpretation of geophysical survey data. It is shown that soil chemical data are particularly valuable for distinguishing anthropogenic and natural impacts creating geophysical anomalies. Contiguity-constrained clustering was found to be a promising data analysis technique for multivariate geochemical survey data.

MRI-based Radiomics nomogram to detect primary rectal cancer with synchronous liver metastases,"Synchronous liver metastasis (SLM) remains a major challenge for rectal cancer. Early detection of SLM is a key factor to improve the survival rate of rectal cancer. In this radiomics study, we predicted the SLM based on the radiomics of primary rectal cancer. A total of 328 radiomics features were extracted from the T2WI images of 194 patients. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was used to reduce the feature dimension and to construct the radiomics signature. after LASSO, principal component analysis (PCA) was used to sort the features of the surplus characteristics, and selected the features of the total contribution of 85%. Then the prediction model was built by linear regression, and the decision curve analysis was used to judge the net benefit of LASSO and PCA. In addition, we used two independent cohorts for training (nâ€‰=â€‰135) and validation (nâ€‰=â€‰159). We found that the model based on LASSO dimensionality construction had the maximum net benefit (in the training set (AUC [95% confidence interval], 0.857 [0.787â€“0.912]) and in the validation set (0.834 [0.714â€“0.918]). The radiomics nomogram combined with clinical risk factors and LASSO features showed a good predictive performance in the training set (0.921 [0.862â€“0.961]) and validation set (0.912 [0.809â€“0.97]). Our study indicated that radiomics based on primary rectal cancer could provide a non-invasive way to predict the risk of SLM in clinical practice.",2019,Scientific Reports

On the Prediction Performance of the Lasso,"Although the Lasso has been extensively studied, the relationship between its prediction performance and the correlations of the covariates is not fully understood. In this paper, we give new insights into this relationship in the context of multiple linear regression. We show, in particular, that the incorporation of a simple correlation measure into the tuning parameter leads to a nearly optimal prediction performance of the Lasso even for highly correlated covariates. However, we also reveal that for moderately correlated covariates, the prediction performance of the Lasso can be mediocre irrespective of the choice of the tuning parameter. For the illustration of our approach with an important application, we deduce nearly optimal rates for the least-squares estimator with total variation penalty",2017,Bernoulli
L'Heure Bleue,"Isak Dinesen and the Ascendant Imagination Ein blauer Augenblick ist nur mehr Seele. [A blue moment is purely and simply soul] ""Sebastian im Traum: Kindheit"" Georg Trakl IN SEVERAL OF THE stories in Winter's Tales, Isak Dinesen makes painterly use of the imaginative breadth of blue.(1) The color functions on two levels: a number of her characters are ultimately enveloped in the blue other-world she constructs early in the collection; and at the same time, her colorific language, calling to mind Kandinsky's assertion that the eye is ""absorbed"" into a circle of blue, draws the reader into her imagined landscape. Recognizing blue's power to express longing, the emotional state that pervades the collection, Dinesen deftly merges the sensual and the spiritual in her chromatic and often oneiric imagery. Though she became a writer, Dinesen writes like a painter relying heavily on the image, whether iconic or symbolic, to express sensations or emotions.(2) Describing the influence of painting on her writing, she has noted: Kunsten har i alle sine Skikkelser betydet uendelig meget for mig. Og jeg tror, at Malerkunsten paa mit eget Sind har virket mest direkte inspirerende.... den har bestandig for mig aabenbaret den virkelige Verdens sande Vosen"" (Lasson 26) [Art has in all its forms meant so much for me. I also believe that painting has most directly influenced my own mind ... it has constantly revealed to me the true essence of the real world]. Thus, the image frequently supercedes the event in her writing. Her characters are not described making passionate love, for instance, but are placed in a blue scene that conveys ecstasy in its chromatic language. In an interview with Jorgen Sandvad while she was writing Winter's Tales, Dinesen commented on her own colorist sensitivity: ""Da jeg i Paris saa Degas' Billeder, syntes jeg, at de viste mig, hvor dejligt, hvor rigt og levende sort er -- det er jo ogsaa en Forkyndelse, en Aabenbaring af en Side af Liver"" (22) [When I saw Degas's paintings in Paris, I thought that they showed me how wonderful, how rich and lively black is -- it is certainly also a proclamation, a revelation of one side of life]. In his provocative study, On Being Blue: A Philosophical Inquiry, William Gass discusses the pictorial and linguistic uses of the color and comments that ""blue, the word and the condition, the color and the act, contrive to contain one another, as if the bottle of the genii were its belly, the lamp's breath the smoke of the wraith"" (11). In blue, color and emotion easily exchange places as subject and object. Because blue, along with green, possesses ""the greatest emotional range;' Gass contends that it is ""therefore most suitable as the color of interior life"" (75-6). His words call to mind the observation of the French philosopher Gaston Bachelard who, in L'Air et les Songes: Essai sur l'imagination du mouvement (1943), wrote: ""Le mot bleu designe, mais il ne montre pas"" (187) [""The word blue designates, but it does not render"" (162)]. Dinesen's reliance on the seductive force of blue in her pictorial imagery reflects both a cultural and a personal predeliction. As a young woman, she admired Georg Brandes's writings and even at the age of nineteen sent the literary giant flowers when he was in the hospital. She was surely familiar with Brandes's apostrophe in Hovedstromninger to ""Laengselen, den blaa Blomst"" [Longing, that blue flower], which is based on Novalis's image of die blaue Blume in Heinrich von Ofterdingen.(3) Hans Holmberg claims that ""Den bla fargen, vintersagornas farg har symboliska overtoner hos Karen Blixen. Dess symboliska karaktar ar av allt att doma bestamd av Georg Brandes' analys av `Den blaa Blomst'"" (82) [The blue color, Winter's Tales's color, has symbolic overtones for Karen Blixen. This symbolic character is apparently determined by Georg Brandes's analysis of ""The Blue Flower""]. â€¦",2001,Scandinavian Studies
On the Support Recovery of Jointly Sparse Gaussian Sources using Sparse Bayesian Learning,"In this work, we provide non-asymptotic, probabilistic guarantees for successful sparse support recovery by the Multiple Sparse Bayesian Learning (M-SBL) algorithm in the multiple measurement vector (MMV) framework. For joint sparse Gaussian sources, we show that M-SBL can perfectly recover their common nonzero support with arbitrarily high probability using only finitely many MMVs. In fact, the support error probability decays exponentially fast with the number of MMVs, with the decay rate depending on the restricted isometry constant of the self Khatri-Rao product of the measurement matrix. Our analysis theoretically confirms that M-SBL can indeed recover supports of size up to $\mathcal{O}(m^{2})$, where $m$ is the number of measurements per MMV. This is in contrast to popular MMV algorithms in compressed sensing such as simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit and group LASSO, which have been shown to succeed only when the sparsity is at most $\mathcal{O}(m)$. Next, in the presence of measurement noise, we show that M-SBL can recover the true $k$-sparse support of $n$-dimensional joint sparse Gaussian sources using at most $\mathcal{O}(k \log{n})$ MMVs, while only a single MMV suffices in the noiseless case. Unlike existing support recovery guarantees for M-SBL, our sufficient conditions are truly non-asymptotic and do not require the orthogonality of the nonzero rows of the joint sparse signals.",2017,ArXiv
Enforcing Group Structure through the Group Fused Lasso,"We introduce the Group Total Variation (GTV) regularizer, a modification of Total Variation that uses the l 2,1 norm instead of the l 1 one to deal with multidimensional features. When used as the only regularizer, GTV can be applied jointly with iterative convex optimization algorithms such as FISTA. This requires to compute its proximal operator which we derive using a dual formulation. GTV can also be combined with a Group Lasso (GL) regularizer, leading to what we call Group Fused Lasso (GFL) whose proximal operator can now be computed combining the GTV and GL proximals through proximal Dykstra algorithm.We will illustrate how to apply GFL in strongly structured but ill-posed regression problems as well as the use of GTV to denoise colour images.",2015,
Anesthesia for Removal of Foreign Bodies in Lower Respiratory Tracts in Souro Sanou University Hospital Center in Bobo-Dioulasso: About 46 Cases,"IntroductionÂ : The inhalation of foreign body is a common cause of respiratory distress in children. Anesthesia for this endoscopy represents a challenge for the anesthesiologist. 
Objective : To assess the anesthetic management of foreign body extraction of the lower respiratory tracts in a context of limited resources. 
Patients and methods : This is a retrospective study in descriptive aim, over 3 years from 1st January 2014 to 31st December 2016. It involved patients admitted for foreign bodies of the lower respiratory tracts in Resuscitation service and ENT in Souro Sanou University Hospital Center in Bobo-Dioulasso . 
Results : A total of 46 patients were hospitalized for foreign bodies of the lower respiratory tracts during the study period. The mean age of the patients was 2.6 years Â± 8.23. Patients were predominantly male with 27 cases (58.70 %), a sex ratio of 1.42. The foreign bodies were of organic type in 82.60% of the cases, against 17.4 % of non organic. The location of foreign bodies was laryngeal in 03 cases (06.52%), tracheal in 06 cases (13.04%) and bronchial in 37 cases (80.43%). The average consultation time was 3.12 days Â± 4.7. The circumstances of discovery were a notion of penetration syndrome in 69.57%, respiratory dyspnea in 91.30%, a queasy cough in 56.52% of cases and a chance discovery in 2.17% of cases. . The foreign bodies were radio-opaque in 17.39% of cases. Extraction of foreign bodies was performed under general anesthesia. In intraoperative operating room, incidents / accidents were noted in 23.91 %. Operative follow-up was simple in 82.60% of cases and complications were recorded in 15.21% of cases. 
Conclusion : Foreign bodies of the lower respiratory tracts remain a topical issue for the child. The therapeutic treatment is based on the realization of a Laryngo-tracheo-bronchial endoscopy, under general anesthesia by an experienced crew.",2018,International Journal Of Medical Science And Clinical Invention
Spontaneous Chiral Symmetry Breaking for Finite Systems.,"Theoretical clues are desirable to help uncover the origin of bio-homochirality in life, as well as the mechanisms for the asymmetric production of functional chiral substances. Here, an open-to-matter reaction network based on a model proposed by Plasson etâ€…al. is studied. In the extended model, the statistical fluctuations lead the system to break chiral symmetry autonomously, that is, without any initial enantiomeric excess or external influence. In the stability diagrams, we observe regions of parameter space that correspond to racemic, homochiral, chiral oscillatory, and, to our knowledge, for the first time in a chiral model, chaotic regimes. The dependencies of the final concentrations of chiral substances on the parameters are determined analytically and discussed for both the racemic and homochiral regimes.",2015,Chemphyschem : a European journal of chemical physics and physical chemistry
Regularized rare variant enrichment analysis for case-control exome sequencing data.,"Rare variants have recently garnered an immense amount of attention in genetic association analysis. However, unlike methods traditionally used for single marker analysis in GWAS, rare variant analysis often requires some method of aggregation, since single marker approaches are poorly powered for typical sequencing study sample sizes. Advancements in sequencing technologies have rendered next-generation sequencing platforms a realistic alternative to traditional genotyping arrays. Exome sequencing in particular not only provides base-level resolution of genetic coding regions, but also a natural paradigm for aggregation via genes and exons. Here, we propose the use of penalized regression in combination with variant aggregation measures to identify rare variant enrichment in exome sequencing data. In contrast to marginal gene-level testing, we simultaneously evaluate the effects of rare variants in multiple genes, focusing on gene-based least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and exon-based sparse group LASSO models. By using gene membership as a grouping variable, the sparse group LASSO can be used as a gene-centric analysis of rare variants while also providing a penalized approach toward identifying specific regions of interest. We apply extensive simulations to evaluate the performance of these approaches with respect to specificity and sensitivity, comparing these results to multiple competing marginal testing methods. Finally, we discuss our findings and outline future research.",2014,Genetic epidemiology
Identification of an immune-related signature for the prognosis of uveal melanoma.,"AIM
To construct an immune-related prognostic signature (IPS) that can distinguish and predict prognosis in uveal melanoma (UM).


METHODS
The transcriptomic data and clinicopathological information of 80 UM patients were extracted from the TCGA database. These patients were randomly assigned to a training and a testing set.


RESULTS
Lasso Cox analysis was performed for the prognostic immune-related genes to develop an IPS for UM in the training set. The signature was validated in both the testing set and entire cohort. We confirmed the prognostic value of our IPS in distinct subgroups and found its association with the T stage and basal diameter of the tumor. Tumor Immune Estimation Resource database analysis revealed that the IPS was negatively correlated with the infiltration of neutrophils and dendritic cells, but positively correlated with the infiltration level of CD8+ T cells. In addition, we demonstrated that immune checkpoints containing PD-1, CTLA-4, IDO, and TIGIT were moderately associated with the IPS.


CONCLUSION
This is the first study to develop and validate an immune-related signature with the ability of predicting prognosis for UM patients. Further studies are needed to validate its prediction accuracy.",2020,International journal of ophthalmology
Regression-based sparse polynomial chaos for uncertainty quantification of subsurface flow models,"Abstract Surrogate-modelling techniques including Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) is commonly used for statistical estimation (aka. Uncertainty Quantification) of quantities of interests obtained from expensive computational models. PCE is a data-driven regression-based technique that relies on spectral polynomials as basis-functions. In this technique, the outputs of few numerical simulations are used to estimate the PCE coefficients within a regression framework combined with regularization techniques where the regularization parameters are estimated using standard cross-validation as applied in supervised machine learning methods. In the present work, we introduce an efficient method for estimating the PCE coefficients combining Elastic Net regularization with a data-driven feature ranking approach. Our goal is to increase the probability of identifying the most significant PCE components by assigning each of the PCE coefficients a numerical value reflecting the magnitude of the coefficient and its stability with respect to perturbations in the input data. In our evaluations, the proposed approach has shown high convergence rate for high-dimensional problems, where standard feature ranking might be challenging due to the curse of dimensionality. The presented method is implemented within a standard machine learning library (scikit-learn [1] ) allowing for easy experimentation with various solvers and regularization techniques (e.g. Tikhonov, LASSO, LARS, Elastic Net) and enabling automatic cross-validation techniques using a widely used and well tested implementation. We present a set of numerical tests on standard analytical functions, a two-phase subsurface flow model and a simulation dataset for CO2 sequestration in a saline aquifer. For all test cases, the proposed approach resulted in a significant increase in PCE convergence rates.",2019,J. Comput. Phys.
Controlling the local false discovery rate in the adaptive Lasso.,"The Lasso shrinkage procedure achieved its popularity, in part, by its tendency to shrink estimated coefficients to zero, and its ability to serve as a variable selection procedure. Using data-adaptive weights, the adaptive Lasso modified the original procedure to increase the penalty terms for those variables estimated to be less important by ordinary least squares. Although this modified procedure attained the oracle properties, the resulting models tend to include a large number of ""false positives"" in practice. Here, we adapt the concept of local false discovery rates (lFDRs) so that it applies to the sequence, Î»n, of smoothing parameters for the adaptive Lasso. We define the lFDR for a given Î»n to be the probability that the variable added to the model by decreasing Î»n to Î»n-Î´ is not associated with the outcome, where Î´ is a small value. We derive the relationship between the lFDR and Î»n, show lFDR =1 for traditional smoothing parameters, and show how to select Î»n so as to achieve a desired lFDR. We compare the smoothing parameters chosen to achieve a specified lFDR and those chosen to achieve the oracle properties, as well as their resulting estimates for model coefficients, with both simulation and an example from a genetic study of prostate specific antigen.",2013,Biostatistics
Gene Expression Profiling Stratifies IDH-Wildtype Glioblastoma With Distinct Prognoses,"Objectives: In the present study, we aimed to determine the candidate genes that may function as biomarkers to further distinguish patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-wildtype glioblastoma (GBM), which are heterogeneous with respect to clinical outcomes. Materials and Methods: We selected 41 candidate genes associated with overall survival (OS) using univariate Cox regression from IDH-wildtype GBM patients based on RNA sequencing (RNAseq) expression data from the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA, n = 105) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, n = 139) cohorts. Next, a seven-gene-based risk signature was formulated according to Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression algorithm in the CGGA RNAseq database as a training set, while another 525 IDH-wildtype GBM patient TCGA datasets, consisting of RNA sequencing and microarray data, were used for validation. Patient survival in the low- and high-risk groups was calculated using Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis and the log-rank test. Uni-and multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to assess the prognosis value. Gene oncology (GO) and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) were performed for the functional analysis of the seven-gene-based risk signature. Results: We developed a seven-gene-based signature, which allocated each patient to a risk group (low or high). Patients in the high-risk group had dramatically shorter overall survival than their low-risk counterparts in three independent cohorts. Univariate and multivariate analysis showed that the seven-gene signature remained an independent prognostic factor. Moreover, the seven-gene risk signature exhibited a striking prognostic validity, with AUC of 78.4 and 73.9%, which was higher than for traditional ""age"" (53.7%, 62.4%) and ""GBM sub-type"" (57.7%, 52.9%) in the CGGA- and TCGA-RNAseq databases, respectively. Subsequent bioinformatics analysis predicted that the seven-gene signature was involved in the inflammatory response, immune response, cell adhesion, and apoptotic process. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that the seven-gene signature could be a potential prognostic biomarker. This study refined the current classification system of IDH-wildtype GBM and may provide a novel perspective for the research and individual therapy of IDH-wildtype GBM.",2019,Frontiers in Oncology
Fault detection in time-varying dynamic process using recursive sparse dynamic PCA,"Principal component analysis is one of the most popular data-driven methods, which is widely used in data compression, modeling, singular value detection, and classification. However, the PCA method is effective under the assumption that the normally distributed process variables have no any serial correlation, which is not reasonable in real industrial practice as some process is not only dynamic but also time-varying because of the time-delays or some disturbances. To address this issue, this article proposes a recursive sparse dynamic PCA method to monitor the time-varying dynamic process. The sparse system matrices varying across time are estimated using an optimization method based on accelerated projected gradient descent and a recursive Lasso method. By employing the $l_{2,1}$ norm term to the optimization method, the system matrix is able to achieve row-wise sparsity, which highly reduces the calculation in subsequent operation. Meanwhile, the use of recursive Lasso ensures affordable calculation complexity in recursively updating the time-varying matrices. The efficiency of the proposed method is verified through a simulation example comparing to the dynamic PCA method.",2018,2018 37th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)
Acquisition et traitement de signaux neurophysiologiques intracÃ©rÃ©braux dans la maladie de Parkinson,"Le premier objectif de notre travail etait de recueillir dans les meilleures conditions les activites neuronales intracerebrales et musculaires peripheriques. Ces signaux sont recueillis au cours d'une intervention chirurgicale dans le cerveau au niveau de trois noyaux : le thalamus, le pallidum et le subthalamus, pour reperer avec une tres grande precision les cibles fonctionnelles en vue d'y implanter des electrodes de stimulation chronique chez des patients souffrant de la maladie de parkinson. Le deuxieme objectif de notre travail etait d'analyser les proprietes des signaux recueillis. L'analyse spectrale parametrique et non parametrique nous a permis de dresser un bilan frequentiel de l'activite intracerebrale. Ainsi nous avons montre que les frequences de bouffees de spikes sont synchrones avec les tremblements. Diverses methodes de filtrage ont ete experimentees. Pour detecter les decharges cellulaires nous avons adopte une methode basee sur le filtrage parallele a horizon mobile. Cela nous a permis de localiser la totalite des decharges en detectant leurs frontieres. Cette methode donne une mesure fiable pour les durees des decharges. En outre, elle permet de faire des analyses statistiques, notamment sur la rythmicite des decharges. Les histogrammes d'intervalle interspike et les histogrammes de frequences de decharges, ont ete calcules. Ceux-ci montrent des differences interessantes dans l'activite neuronale des noyaux etudies, tant au niveau des decharges spontanees que celles qui accompagnent un mouvement. Apres la detection des decharges et afin de mieux les caracteriser, nous constituons pour chacune d'elle un vecteur de deux parametres : amplitude et duree. Nous classons par la suite les vecteurs ainsi constitues avec une methode de classification basee sur la logique floue, les resultats montrent l'existence de plusieurs populations de cellules. Ceci peut constituer la base de futurs travaux neurophysiologiques et neuroanatomiques.",1997,
Analysis of a Kepler Light Curve of the Novalike Cataclysmic Variable KIC 8751494,"We analyzed a Kepler light curve of KIC 8751494, a recently recognized novalike cataclysmic variable in the Kepler field. We detected a stable periodicity of 0.114379(1) d, which we identified as being the binary's orbital period. The stronger photometric period around 0.12245 d, which had been detected from the ground-based observation, was found to be variable, and we identified this period as being the positive superhump period. This superhump period showed short-term (10-20 d) and strong variations in period most unexpectedly when the object entered a slightly faint state. The fractional superhump excess varied as large as ~30%. The variation of the period very well traced the variation of the brightness of the system. The time-scales of this variation of the superhump period was too slow to be interpreted as the variation caused by the change in the disk radius due to the thermal disk instability. We interpreted that the period variation was caused by the varying pressure effect on the period of positive superhumps. This finding suggests that the pressure effect, in at least novalike systems, plays a very important (up to ~30% in the precession rate) role in producing the period of the positive superhumps. We also described a possible detection of the negative superhumps with a varying period of 0.1071-0.1081 d in the Q14 run of the Kepler data. We also found that the phase of the velocity variation of the emission lines reported in the earlier study is compatible with the SW Sex-type classification. Further, we introduced a new two-dimentional period analysis using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) and showed superior advantage of this method.",2013,Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan

"Feature network models for proximity data : statistical inference, model selection, network representations and links with related models","Feature Network Models (FNM) are graphical structures that represent
 proximity data in a discrete space with the use of features. A 
statistical inference theory is introduced, based on the additivity 
properties of networks and the linear regression framework. Considering 
features as predictor variables leads in a natural way to a univariate 
multiple regression problem with positivity restrictions on the 
parameters, which represent edge lengths in the network representation. 
Theoretical standard errors and confidence intervals are obtained for 
the parameters and their performance is evaluated by Monte Carlo 
simulation. When the feature structure is not known in advance, a 
strategy is proposed to select an adequate subset of features that takes
 into account a good compromise between model fit and model complexity 
using Gray codes and the positive lasso. The same statistical inference 
theory also holds for additive trees that are special cases of FNM. 
Standard errors and confidence intervals, model tests and prediction 
error are obtained for the estimates of the branch lengths of additive 
trees. The dissertation concludes by demonstrating that there exists a 
universal network representation of city-block models based on key 
elements of the network representation consisting of betweenness, metric
 segmental additivity and internal nodes.",2006,
Nachruf auf die Musikaliensammlung der Herzogin Anna Amalia Bibliothek Weimar,"Neben den ungezahlten, zum Teil einmaligen Drucken des 16. bis 18. Jahrhunderts ist bei dem Brand in der Herzogin Anna Amalia Bibliothek in Weimar am 2. September 2004 auch nahezu die gesamte Musikaliensammlung (2827 Titel) verloren gegangen. Einige fur Ausstellungen ausgeliehene und die aus der noch gluhenden Asche geborgenen Partituren und Einzelblatter konnen nur ein geringer Trost fur diesen unfassbaren Verlust darstellen. Wenig war bisher uber die Musikaliensammlung bekannt. Aus der fruhen Weimarer Zeit hatten sich nach dem ebenfalls verheerenden Schlossbrand 330 Jahre zuvor Triosonaten Kriegers (1693), Violinsonaten Westhoffs (1704), sechs Konzerte Johann Ernsts von SachsenWeimarEisenach und Handschriften Witts erhalten. Vor allem ein seltenes, nicht vervielfaltigtes Stimmbuch Orlando di Lassos (1588) gehorte zu den altesten Drucken dieses Bestandes. Im Wesentlichen enthielt die Musikaliensammlung jedoch Handschriften und Drucke aus den privaten Sammlungen Anna Amalias und Maria Pawlownas. Die wohl wertvollste Handschrift Mozarts Autograph des B-Dur-Klavierkonzerts KV 450 befand sich als Exponat in der Ausstellung uber Maria Pawlowna und entging so der Vernichtung. Zu Anna Amalias Sammlungsschwerpunkten zahlte vorrangig die italienische Oper, die sie u. a. auf ihren Reisen kennen gelernt hatte. Handschriften und Drucke etwa von Piccinnis II barone di Torreforte, Anfossis La maga Circe, Bertonis Orieo ed Euridice, Cimarosas La ballerina amante, Jommellis LOlimpiade, Paisiellos II Socrate immaginario, Sartis LOlimpiade, Salieris Tarare, Galuppis II mondo alla roversa sowie Fiorillos Li birbi und L'amante ingannatore mogen ein Zeugnis fur dieses Interesse gewesen sein. Aus ihrer Braunschweiger Zeit stammten moglicherweise noch etliche Opern und Oratorien Hasses. Daneben befanden sich in dem Bestand Haydns L'isola disabitata, Glucks Alceste, Iphigenie en Tauride und Iphigenie en Aulide, Reichardts Carmen funebre, Schulz' Chore und Gesange zur Athalia und Naumanns Cora. Aus der Zeit vor dem Schlossbrand enthielt die Sammlung Bendas Romeo und Julia und vermutlich Ernst Wilhelm Wolfs Vertonung von Wielands Alceste. Vor allem ein Teil der am Hofe entstandenen Singspiele der Liebhabertheaterzeit ist unwiederbringlich verloren: so das von Anna Amalia gemeinsam mit Wolf komponierte Singspiel Die Zigeuner (T: Einsiedel) und Seckendorffs Singspiel Lila (T: Goethe). An Kirchenmusik war Anna Amalia Haydns Schopfung, Cimarosas Missa pro defunctis, Jommellis Miserere, Carl Philipp Emanuel Bachs Oratorium Die Israeliten in der Wuste (Druck 1775) und Pergolesis Stabat mater vertraut. Unter der Kammerund Orchestermusik befanden sich Manuskripte der Klaviersonaten und verschiedene Kompositionen Abels, der Bach-Sohne, Clementis, Mozarts, Kozeluchs, Haydns und von den Komponisten aus dem Weimarer Umfeld (u.a. Wolfs und Seckendorffs). Die Grosherzogin Maria Pawlowna fuhrte diese Sammlung bis in die Mitte des 19. Jahrhunderts weiter. Was allerdings die Musikaliensammlung insgesamt auszeichnete, welche Partituren und Stimmen wann und unter welchen Umstanden hinzukamen und welche Rolle sie fur das Weimarer Musikund Theaterleben spielten, wird mit ihrer Vernichtung der Nachwelt verborgen bleiben. Denn bislang war sie nur vereinzelt Gegenstand der Forschung. Der zunachst erscheinende Katalog der Musikaliensammlung der Anna Amalia in der Dissertation von Sandra Dreise-Beckmann (Anna Amalia von Sachsen-Weimar-Eisenach. Eine Musikliebhaberin) lasst ahnen, was dieser Verlust bedeutet. Erst jungst hatte die DFG die Mittel fur die zweite Arbeitsphase des Forschungsprojekts â€žMusik und Theater"" (Teilprojekt C 8 des SFB 482 â€žEreignis Weimar-Jena. Kultur um 1800"") bewilligt, in der die Provenienz und die Bedeutung dieser Musikalien fur das Weimarer Theater untersucht werden sollten.

Directed Adaptive Graphical Lasso for causality inference,"Graphical lasso provides a general solution to reveal the indirect statistic dependence of multiple variables in the high dimensional space. Rather than the undirected relationships, a number of practical problems concern much about the causality between nodes in terms of directed links. To address this challenge, in this letter, we propose Directed Adaptive Graphical Lasso (DAGL), a general framework for directed graph structure inference in the framework of sparse learning and graph theory. Both the experiments from simulation and cellular signaling system identification verify that DAGL could robustly predict the directed graph structure and accurately reveal the inherent causality between nodes.",2016,Neurocomputing
"Lalande, 'le Lully latin'","Jean Bodinâ€™s Six livres de la RÃ©publique of 1576. This source and its Pythagorean musical metaphors of social orders are not new to music historians. But Van Ordenâ€™s subtle gaze brings forth some compelling insights about the relationship between musical and social harmony as it was understood in Renaissance France. Similarly, in â€˜Violence, dance and the ballet de courâ€™ the history of social dancing at court yields up new perspectives on performance and social control. Metre and movement, according to this third chapter, were the animating processes that permittedâ€”even compelledâ€”courtiers to channel their violent, demonstrative passions in ways that were acceptable in an age of increasing royal control. Emerging in the 16th century and culminating in works such as the famous DÃ©liverance de Renault performed at court in 1617, the French ballets du cour are in this view a form of ritual violence that sought to subordinate the dangerous energies of private duels and private armies to central authority. Sacred music, too, as we learn in â€˜The cross and the swordâ€™, could serve as a means of promoting a theatre of state in an age racked by religious conflict between Catholic and Protestant communities. Of particular interest here are the perspectives on the royal ceremony books of the 1580s, and especially the tradition of the Te Deum. In addition to some provocative ideas on the appropriation of popular processionals and singing in the service of royal ritual, Van Orden offers some very interesting readings of polychoral works by Lasso, Guillaume Boni and Eustache du Caurroy that have otherwise had little critical attention. In â€˜Pyrrhic dance and art of warâ€™ we pause to consider the legacy of classical discourse on battle as choreography that was assimilated to the practice of gunpowder warfare by Renaissance humanists. As in previous chapters, the focus remains with time, and especially with rhythmic patterns of military drills, cadences and signals as the means to control increasingly largeâ€” and increasingly professionalâ€”armies of the French state. Invoking authorities from Plato to Descartes and even Foucault, Van Orden here shows us that civility and military discipline intersect through the organizing power of rhythm. Turning at last to the final chapter, on the ballet Ã  cheval and the remarkable Carrousel du Roi of 1612, we cannot help but wonder at the immense range of sources assembled in this excellent book, and the patient learning with which they have been considered.",2006,Early Music

Introduction: special issue on 'informal institutions and development in Africa',"developmental potential of informal institutions has long been a subject of intense interest in Africa. Indeed, Africa has been the crucible of many of the concepts used to explore informal development processes. It was in West Africa that notions of the embedded development of market institutions emerged in the 1960s and 1970s, in the work of Curtin (1975), Meillassoux (1971) and Cohen (1969) on the efficiency of ethnic and religious trading systems. During the same period, the concept of social networks was forged in southern and central Africa to explore the role of informal ties of kinship, friendship and community in processes of urbanization and class formation (Mayer 1961; Mitchell 1969; Peace 1979). Perhaps most famously, Africa was also the cradle of the informal sector concept in Keith Hart's (1973) celebrated article on income generation among the urban poor in Accra. All of these concepts embeddedness, social networks and the informal sector have become central to illuminating the role of informal institutions in contemporary economic and political change in every region of the world. Yet in Africa, perspectives on informal organization have become shrouded in shadows. Despite growing interest in the role of African informal institutions, current research is often clouded by essentialist leanings and an apparent forgetfulness of earlier theoretical advances. Indeed, a survey of the literature on indigenous political and economic organization in contemporary Africa gives the impression that we actually know less about African informal institutions today than we did three decades ago, despite the dramatic expansion of informality and the flourishing of concepts to study it. Part of the problem lies in the particularly rapid expansion of informal economic and political institutions in contemporary Africa as a result of economic liberalization and state failure. Just after the turn of the millennium, the ILO (2002: 16) noted that 'in sub-Saharan Africa, the informal sector accounts for three-quarters of non-agricultural employment, having increased dramatically over the last decade from about two-thirds'. In the past two decades, African informal institutions have blurred formerly recognized conceptual boundaries between the formal and informal by expanding beyond peripheral sectors and cultural institutions to penetrate into the heart of modern economic and political organization. According to the ILO (2002), the informal economy accounts for 60% of Africa's urban labour force, and",2007,
Component-based regularisation of multivariate generalised linear mixed models,"We address the componentâ€“based regularisation of a multivariate Generalised Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) in the framework of grouped data. A set Y of random responses is modelled with a multivariate GLMM, based on a set X of explanatory variables, a setA of additional explanatory variables, and random effects to introduce the withinâ€“group dependence of observations. Variables in X are assumed many and redundant so that regression demands regularisation. This is not the case for A, which contains few and selected variables. Regularisation is performed building an appropriate number of orthogonal components that both contribute to model Y and capture relevant structural information in X. To estimate the model, we propose to maximise a criterion specific to the Supervised Componentâ€“based Generalised Linear Regression (SCGLR) within an adaptation of Schallâ€™s algorithm. This extension of SCGLR is tested on both simulated and real grouped data, and compared to ridge and LASSO regularisations. Supplementary material for this article is available online.",2019,

In this study, three learning methods, stepwise selection, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and Bayesian model averaging (BMA), were used to build NTCP models of xerostomia following radiotherapy treatment for head and neck cancer. Performance of each learning method was evaluated by a repeated cross-validation scheme in order to obtain a fair comparison among methods.


RESULTS
It was found that the LASSO and BMA methods produced models with significantly better predictive power than that of the stepwise selection method. Furthermore, the LASSO method yields an easily interpretable model as the stepwise method does, in contrast to the less intuitive BMA method.


CONCLUSIONS
The commonly used stepwise selection method, which is simple to execute, may be insufficient for NTCP modeling. The LASSO method is recommended.",2012,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics"
Rapid compositional analysis of sawdust using sparse method and near infrared spectroscopy,"This paper proposes to measure the components of sawdust by combining a new sparse method with near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy technology. The spectroscopic data of sawdust samples are acquired by the means of Fourier transform near-infrared (FT-NIR) spectrometer. Wavelet filter is used to remove undesired noises from the spectroscopic data, and multivariate statistical methods, such as principal component regression (PCR), partial least squares regression (PLS) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) are used to model the relationship between the spectroscopic data and sawdust composition. The constructed model is then tested on a set of new samples. Compared with PCR and PLS, it is shown that LASSO, a sparse method, is capable of constructing a sparse model with stronger ability in interpretation while retaining good modeling accuracy.",2014,The 26th Chinese Control and Decision Conference (2014 CCDC)

Different Bacterial Communities Involved in Peptide Decomposition between Normoxic and Hypoxic Coastal Waters,"Proteins and peptides are key components of the labile dissolved organic matter pool in marine environments. Knowing which types of bacteria metabolize peptides can inform the factors that govern peptide decomposition and further carbon and nitrogen remineralization in marine environments. A 13C-labeled tetrapeptide, alanine-valine-phenylalanine-alanine (AVFA), was added to both surface (normoxic) and bottom (hypoxic) seawater from a coastal station in the northern Gulf of Mexico for a 2-day incubation experiment, and bacteria that incorporated the peptide were identified using DNA stable isotope probing (SIP). The decomposition rate of AVFA in the bottom hypoxic seawater (0.018-0.035 Î¼M h-1) was twice as fast as that in the surface normoxic seawater (0.011-0.017 Î¼M h-1). SIP experiments indicated that incorporation of 13C was highest among the Flavobacteria, Sphingobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Acidimicrobiia, Verrucomicrobiae, Cyanobacteria, and Actinobacteria in surface waters. In contrast, highest 13C-enrichment was mainly observed in several Alphaproteobacteria (Thalassococcus, Rhodobacteraceae, Ruegeria) and Gammaproteobacteria genera (Colwellia, Balneatrix, Thalassomonas) in the bottom water. These data suggest that a more diverse group of both oligotrophic and copiotrophic bacteria may be involved in metabolizing labile organic matter such as peptides in normoxic coastal waters, and several copiotrophic genera belonging to Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria and known to be widely distributed may contribute to faster peptide decomposition in the hypoxic waters.",2017,Frontiers in Microbiology
"Study of mosaic glasses from the Alpha Basilica (sixth century) of Nikopolis in Epirus, Greece","Summary After collecting the essential historical, archaeological, and artistic information relative to the ancient town of Nikopolis in Epirus and its Alpha (or Doumetios) Basilica, built in the sixth century A.D., glass tesserae belonging to degraded and lost parts of the mosaic floors of the basilica were analysed, determining their chemical composition and the possible presence of crystalline phases. As in all glasses produced in the Mediterranean area in that epoch, they are soda-lime silicate glasses, in part with lead, obtained using natron as a flux. The typology of the glass corresponds to that of Roman glasses, of the first centuries A.D., and is the same as that employed for the basilicas of Ravenna in the fifth and sixth centuries; in particular, a comparison was made with the glass tesserae of the St Vitale Basilica. The technological base for producing coloured glasses is also practically the same as that of the mosaic glasses of Ravenna. In particular, antimony was used as an opacifying element and a fusion was carried out under reducing conditions to obtain red glass with microparticles of metallic copper. Thus, it can be supposed there was a common source of production of the mosaic glasses used in Nikopolis and Ravenna in the sixth century and that this source was in the Near Orient. Riassunto Dopo la raccolta delle informazioni essenziali di carattere storico, archeologico e artistico relative allâ€™antica citta di Nicopoli dâ€™Epiro e alla sua Basilica Alfa (o Doumetios), costruita nel VI secolo d.C., sono state analizzate tessere vitree che appartenevano a parti dei pavimenti musivi della basilica degradate e andate perdute, determinando la loro composizione chimica e la eventuale presenza di fasi cristalline. Come tutti i vetri dellâ€™epoca prodotti in area mediterranea si tratta di vetri silicatico-sodico-calcici, in parte piombici, ottenuti usando natron quale fondente. La tipologia del vetro corrisponde a quella dei vetri Romani, dei primi secoli d.C., ed e la stessa dei vetri musivi impiegati nelle basiliche ravennati del V e VI secolo; in particolare il confronto e stato effettuato con la composizione delle tessere vetrose della basilica di San Vitale. Anche la tecnologia alla base dellâ€™ottenimento dei vetri colorati e praticamente la stessa dei vetri ravennati. In particolare, e stato usato antimonio come elemento opacizzante e condotta una fusione in ambiente riducente per ottenere vetro rosso con microparticelle di rame metallico. Si puo, dunque, fare lâ€™ipotesi di una fonte produttiva comune dei vetri musivi impiegati a Nicopoli e a Ravenna nel VI secolo e che tale fonte fosse nel Vicino Oriente. Resume Apres la collecte des informations essentielles a caractere historique, archeologique et artistique concernant la ville antique de Nicopolis dâ€™Epire et sa basilique Alpha (ou Doumetios), construite au VI eÂ  siecle apr.Â J.-C., il a ete procede a lâ€™analyse des tesselles de verre qui appartenaient a des parties des pavements de mosaique de la basilique qui ont ete degrades et perdus, a la definition de leur composition chimique et au releve dâ€™une eventuelle presence de phases cristallines. Comme tous les verres de lâ€™epoque fabriques dans la region mediterraneenne, il sâ€™agit de verres silico-sodiques-calciques, en partie plombiques, qui ont ete obtenus en utilisant le natron comme fondant. La typologie du verre correspond a celle des verres romains des premiers siecles apr.Â J.-C., et câ€™est la meme que celle des verres de mosaique employes dans les basiliques de Ravenne des V e et VI eÂ  siecles. Notamment, une comparaison a ete effectuee sur la composition des tesselles de verre de la basilique de Saint-Vital. La technique permettant dâ€™obtenir des verres colores est pratiquement la meme que celle des verres de Ravenne. En particulier, lâ€™antimoine a ete utilise comme element opacifiant, et une fusion en milieu reducteur a permis dâ€™obtenir un verre rouge avec des microparticules de cuivre metallique. Nous pouvons donc emettre lâ€™hypothese dâ€™une source commune de fabrication des verres de mosaique utilises a Nicopolis et a Ravenne au VI eÂ  siecle, et que cette source se trouvait au Proche Orient. Zusammenfassung Nachdem die wesentlichen historischen, archaologischen und kunstlerischen Informationen uber die antike Stadt Nikopolis in Epirus und ihre im 6. Jahrhundert n. Chr. errichtete Basilika Alpha (auch Doumetios) eingeholt worden waren, wurden Glassteine analysiert, die zu zerstorten und verloren gegangenen Teilen des Mosaikbodens der Basilika gehorten, um ihre chemische Zusammensetzung und den eventuellen Gehalt an Kristallphasen zu bestimmen. Wie alle anderen Glassorten, die damals im Mittelmeergebiet hergestellt wurden, handelt es sich auch hier um silikat-, natrium- und kalkhaltiges, teils auch bleihaltiges Glas, das unter Verwendung von Natron als Schmelzmittel hergestellt wurde. Diese Glassorte entspricht derjenigen der Romischen Glaser aus den ersten Jahrhunderten n. Chr. und es ist die gleiche Glassorte, wie die der Glassteine, die in den Basiliken von Ravenna aus dem 5. und 6. Jahrhundert verwendet wurden.Â  Im Einzelnen wurde der Vergleich mit den Mosaiksteinen aus Glas in der Basilika San Vitale vorgenommen. Auch die Technik der Herstellung farbigen Glases ist praktisch die gleiche, die in Ravenna zum Einsatz kam. Insbesondere wurde Antimon zur Opakisierung und ein Reduktions-Schmelzverfahren zur Herstellung roten Glases mit Mikropartikeln metallischen Kupfers verwendet. Es kann also angenommen werden, dass die Mosaik-Glassteine in Nikopolis und Ravenna im 6. Jahrhundert aus der gleichen Produktionsquelle stammten, und dass sich diese Quelle im Vorderen Orient befand. Resumen Tras haber recogido la informacion esencial desde el punto de vista historico, arqueologico y artistico sobre la antigua ciudad de Nicopolis de Epiro y de su Basilica Alfa (o de Dumetios), construida en el siglo VI d.C., se han analizado las teselas de vidrio pertenecientes a partes del pavimento musivario de la basilica, las cuales han sufrido degrado o han desaparecido, para determinar su composicion quimica y la eventual presencia de fases cristalinas. Al igual que los demas vidrios producidos en el area del Mediterraneo en aquella epoca, se trata de vidrios de silicato sodico calcico, en parte plumbicos, obtenidos utilizando natron como fundente. El tipo de vidrio corresponde al de los vidrios romanos de los primeros siglos d.C. y es el mismo de los vidrios musivarios empleados en las basilicas de Ravena en los siglos V y VI; en particular, se ha realizado una comparacion con la composicion de las teselas de vidrio de la basilica de San Vital. Incluso la tecnologia empleada para obtener vidrios de colores es practicamente la misma que la de los vidrios de Ravena. En particular, se ha empleado antimonio como elemento opacador y se ha conducido una fusion en ambiente reductor para obtener vidrio rojo con microparticulas de cobre metalico. Por tanto, es posible plantear la hipotesis de que habria una fuente productiva comun de los vidrios musivarios de Nicopolis y de Ravena en el siglo VI y que dicha fuente se habria encontrado en el Cercano Oriente.

Finally, the reliability of the algorithm and the validity of the feature weight coefficient are verified by comparing the results of four datasets.",2019,2019 Chinese Automation Congress (CAC)
"Diverse feeding ecology and habitat use in coral reef fishes in the Malaysian South China Sea, as revealed by liver fatty acid composition","Abstract Fatty acid analysis was used to understand feeding ecology and habitat use of coral reef fishes in six families: Lutjanidae (Lutjanus lutjanus), Labridae (Thalassoma lunare), Nemipteridae (Scolopsis affinis, S. monogramma), Pomacentridae (Abudefduf bengalensis, A. sexfasciatus, A. viagiensis), Scaridae (Scarus quoyi, S. quoyi, S. rivulatus, S. ghobban) and Serrandae (Epinephelus fuscoguttatus, Cephalopholis cyanostigma, C. boenak) collected on the Bidong Island of the Malaysian South China Sea. The percentage of saturated fatty acids (Î£SAFA) ranged from 58.0% to 62.5%, with the highest values in fatty acids, the second highest percentage values were those of monounsaturated fatty acids (Î£MUFA) and they ranged from 25.7% to 38.9%, and the percentage of polyunsaturated fatty acids (Î£PUFA) had the lowest values, i.e. from 2.7% to 13.2%. Î£MUFA and Î£PUFA were significantly different between families, while Î£SAFA did not differ.

Distinguished Minimal Topological Lassos,"The ease with which genomic data can now be generated using Next Generation Sequencing technologies combined with a wealth of legacy data holds great promise for exciting new insights into the evolutionary relationships between and within the kingdoms of life. At the subspecies level (e.g., varieties or strains) dendograms, that is, certain edge-weighted rooted trees whose leaves are the elements of a set $X$ of organisms under consideration, are often used to represent those relationships. As is well known, dendrograms can be uniquely reconstructed from distances provided all distances on $X$ are known. More often than not, real biological datasets do not satisfy this assumption, implying that the sought dendrogram need not be uniquely determined by the available distances with regard to topology, edge-weighting, or both. To better understand the structural properties a set $\mathcal{L}\subseteq\binom{X}{2}$ has to satisfy to overcome this problem, various types of lassos have been introduced.

"Morbidity and Mortality of Inpatients in the Department of Infectious Diseases of the University Hospital of Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso","Background: Infectious Diseases are responsible for nearly 17 million annual deaths worldwide. Burkina Faso, like the majority of poor countries, remains vulnerable to infectious diseases. The objective of the present study was to analyze the profile of inpatients, including the mortality and causes of death, in the Infectious Diseases Department of Souro Sanou teaching hospital (Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso). Methods: We carried out a cross-sectional study based on medical records of all inpatients from 2011 to 2015. Results: We included 1169 patients. The gender ratio was 0.8. The age group 30 to 39 was more represented (30.2%) as well as housewives and farmers (73.7%). Over one-thirds of the patients (35.3%) were consulted within an average of 7 days. The most common reason for consultation was fever (65.1%). Around 62.0% of inpatients were infected by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Digestive diseases ranked first (21.8%) followed by nervous system disorders (19.4%) and tuberculosis (17.8%). Overall morbidity rate was 31.3%. About 42% were admitted to the emergency ward while 83.3% already arrived with poor health condition. And 82.1% of deaths occurred on pathological grounds of which 66.7% were related to HIV. Main causes of death included nervous system diseases (28.6%), tuberculosis (21.9%) and gastrointestinal diseases (18.3%). Conclusion: Infectious diseases remain a major public health issue.

Das extracellular matrix binding protein von Staphylococcus epidermidisvermittelt Biofilmbildung und AdhÃ¤renz an Fibronektin,"Die Bildung bakterieller Biofilme ist von entscheidender Bedeutung fur die Pathogenese fremdmaterialassoziierter Infektionen durch Staphylococcus epidermidis. Unbedingte Voraussetzung fur die Entstehung dieser mehrschichtigen bakteriellen Gemeinschaften ist die Expression interzellularer Adhasine. Neben extrazellularen Kohlenhydraten konnen offenbar auch Proteine diese wesentliche Rolle im Akkumulationsprozess ubernehmen. Wir konnten zeigen, dass Biofilmbildung bei dem S. epidermidis Isolat 1585v durch die Uberexpression einer trunkierten 460 kDa-Variante des extracellular matrix binding protein (Embp) hervorgerufen wird. Embp ist ein modular aufgebautes fibronektinbindendes Oberflachenprotein und besteht im Wesentlichen aus repetitiv angeordneten Found in various architectures (FIVAR) und G-related albumin-binding (GA) Domanen. Weitere Untersuchungen mit verschiedenen Embp-positiven und -negativen S. epidermidis Stammen sowie anti-Embp Antiseren und rekombinanten Embp-Fragmenten bestatigten eine biofilminduzierende Wirkung auch fur die 1 MDa grose Wildtyp-Variante von Embp und verorteten die interzellular adhasiven Eigenschaften im distalen Molekulanteil mit alternierend angeordneten FIVAR und GA Domanen. Die beobachteten Embp- vermittelte Biofilme schutzten S. epidermidis vor der Phagozytose durch makrophagenartige Zellen und konnen daher als funktionell relevant angesehen werden. Embp vermittelt zudem die Adhasion von Bakterien an fibronektinbeschichtete Oberflachen uber die Wechselwirkung zwischen den FIVAR-Domanen und bestimmten Typ-III Domanen von Fibronektin. Das Oberflachenprotein Embp ist damit an entscheidenden Reaktionen in allen Phasen der bakteriellen Biofilmbildung beteiligt und kommt damit als Virulenzfaktor fur die Pathogenese fremdmaterialassoziierter Infektionen in Frage. 
Virulence of the nosocomial pathogen Staphylococcus epidermidis is essentially related to the formation of biofilms. After primary attachment to an artificial surface these multilayered bacterial communities are assembled by the expression of intercellular adhesins. Growing evidence supports the idea that proteins are functionally involved in this process of accumulation. We found that in S. epidermidis 1585v overexpression of a 460 kDa truncated isoform of the extracellular matrix-binding protein (Embp) is essential for biofilm formation. Embp is a giant fibronectin-binding protein harbouring repetitive Found In Various Architectures (FIVAR) and G-related albumin-binding (GA) domains. Further studies using defined Embp-positive and -negative S. epidermidis strains, anti-Embp antisera and recombinant Embp fragments confirmed that Embp is sufficient for biofilm formation and that the moleculeâ€™s intercellular adhesive properties can be ascribed to the distal part consisting of alternate FIVAR and GA domains. Embp-mediated biofilm have been shown to be functionally active in terms of protecting S. epidermidis from phagocytosis by macrophage-like cells. Further data showed that the FIVAR domains of Embp mediate binding of bacterial cells to solid-phase attached fibronectin, constituting the first step of biofilm formation on conditioned surfaces. Thus, Embp is a multifunctional cell surface protein that mediates attachment to host extracellular matrix, biofilm accumulation and escape from phagocytosis, and therefore is well suited for promoting implant-associated infections.",2012,

Recently M. Jaggi has observed that Constrained Lasso (CL) can be reduced to an SVM-like problem, for which the LIBSVM library provides very efficient algorithms. This suggests that it could also be used advantageously to solve CL. In this work we will refine Jaggiâ€™s arguments to reduce CL as well as constrained Elastic Net to a Nearest Point Problem, which in turn can be rewritten as an appropriate Î½ -SVM problem solvable by LIBSVM. We will also show experimentally that the well-known LIBSVM library results in a faster convergence than GLMNet for small problems and also, if properly adapted, for larger ones. Screening is another ingredient to speed up solving Lasso. Shrinking can be seen as the simpler alternative of SVM to screening and we will discuss how it also may in some cases reduce the cost of an SVM-based CL solution.",2018,Neurocomputing
Characterization of the conditional independences between genes answers,"Bulk gene expression experiments relied on aggregations of thou10 sands of cells to measure the average expression in an organism. Ad11 vances in microfluidic and droplet sequencing now permit expression 12 profiling in single cells. This study of cell-to-cell variation reveals 13 that individual cells lack detectable expression of transcripts that 14 appear abundant on a population level, giving rise to zero-inflated 15 expression patterns. To infer gene co-regulatory networks from such 16 data, we propose a multivariate Hurdle model. It is comprised of a 17 mixture of singular Gaussian distributions. We employ neighborhood 18 selection with the pseudo-likelihood and a group lasso penalty to 19 select and fit undirected graphical models that capture conditional 20 independences between genes. The proposed method is more sensi21 tive than existing approaches in simulations, even under departures 22 from our Hurdle model. The method is applied to data for T follicu23 lar helper cells, and a high-dimensional profile of mouse dendritic 24 cells. It infers network structure not revealed by other methods; 25 or in bulk data sets. An R implementation is available at https: 26 //github.com/amcdavid/HurdleNormal. 27",2018,
"Description of Thalassospira lohafexi sp. nov., isolated from Southern Ocean, Antarctica","A gram-negative, aerobic, obligatory halophilic, curved-to-spiral rod-shaped, uni- or bi-polar flagellated motile bacterium 139Z-12T was isolated from water samples collected from Southern Ocean surrounding Antarctica as part of the Indo-German iron fertilization experiment â€œLOHAFEX.â€ The bacterium was positive for catalase, oxidase, and gelatinase, with C18:1Ï‰7c (20.1Â %), C16:0 (7.3Â %), C16:1Ï‰7c (28.9Â %), and C12:0 (19.0Â %) as the predominant fatty acids, phosphatidylglycerol, and phosphatidylethanolamine as major lipids and Q-10 as the major respiratory quinone. DNA GÂ +Â C content (mol%) of strain 139Z-12T was 53.0. Both BLAST and EzTaxon identified strain 139Z-12T as affiliated species of the genus Thalassospira with 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities ranging from 97.9 to 99.9Â %. Based on above characteristics, strain 139Z-12T was assigned to the genus Thalassospira. Since strain 139Z-12T shared a DNAâ€“DNA similarity of <70.0Â % with members of the genus Thalassospira, 139Z-12T was identified as a novel species of the genus and named as Thalassospira lohafexi sp. nov. In addition to this, strain 139Z-12T, based on REP-PCR, delineated at a similarity coefficient of <0.67 from other species of the genus Thalassospira and also exhibited a MLSA distance of <95.5Â %, a value less than the interspecies distance determined previously for the genus Thalassospira, further supporting the species status. In addition, species rank was further confirmed by other polyphasic characteristics. The type strain of Thalassospira lohafexi sp. nov. is 139Z-12T (KCTC 32347TÂ =Â LMG 27449TÂ =Â MCC 2233TÂ =Â NBRC 110402T).",2015,Archives of Microbiology

Linear Convergence of SVRG in Statistical Estimation,"The last several years has witness the huge success on the stochastic variance reduction method in the finite sum problem. However assumption on strong convexity to have linear rate limits its applicability. In particular, it does not include several important formulations such as Lasso, group Lasso, logistic regression, and some nonconvex models including corrected Lasso and SCAD. In this paper, we prove that, for a class of statistical M-estimators covering examples mentioned above, SVRG solves the formulation with a linear convergence rate without strong convexity or even convexity. Our analysis makes use of restricted strong convexity, under which we show that SVRG converges linearly to the fundamental statistical precision of the model, i.e., the difference between true unknown parameter Î¸âˆ— and the optimal solution Î¸Ì‚ of the model.",2016,ArXiv
Palynological evidence for late-Holocene human occupation recorded in two wetlands in SW Turkey,"Pollen diagrams from mountain lakes and marshes in SW Turkey show evidence of intensive anthropogenic influence in the landscape between 3500 and 1300 BP. Three cores from within the territory of the classical city Sagalassos (Western Taurus, Pisidia) were palynologically analysed to make a reconstruction of the past vegetation in the territory of Sagalassos and to estimate the impact of its inhabitants on the landscape in Pisidia. Two cores originate from an intramontane marsh (Gravgaz; elevation 1215 m) and one from a seasonal intramontane lake (Canakh; elevation 1030 m). Human acitivity is apparent from c. 2530 BP in the pollen diagrams. A deforestation phase/'disturbance' phase (from c. 2530 BP/c. 2480 BP till c. 2280 BP/c. 2270 BP), anthropogenically or climatologically driven, precedes a cultivation period (arboricultural phase) (from c. 2280 BP/2270 BP till c. 1480 BP/c. 1270 BP). The results of the pollen analyses of the three cores are compared and show many similarities. There are also similarities with other cores from SW Turkey, although the arboricultural phase (mainly olive cultivation) occurs later in the cores from the Sagalassos territory than in other cores from SW Turkey.",2002,The Holocene

Cirrus: An Automated Mammography-Based Measure of Breast Cancer Risk Based on Textural Features,"Background
We applied machine learning to find a novel breast cancer predictor based on information in a mammogram.


Methods
Using image-processing techniques, we automatically processed 46Â 158 analog mammograms for 1345 cases and 4235 controls from a cohort and case-control study of Australian women, and a cohort study of Japanese American women, extracting 20 textural features not based on pixel brightness threshold. We used Bayesian lasso regression to create individual- and mammogram-specific measures of breast cancer risk, Cirrus. We trained and tested measures across studies. We fitted Cirrus with conventional mammographic density measures using logistic regression, and computed odds ratios (OR) per standard deviation adjusted for age and body mass index.


Results
Combining studies, almost all textural features were associated with case-control status. The ORs for Cirrus measures trained on one study and tested on another study ranged from 1.56 to 1.78 (all Pâ€‰<â€‰10-6). For the Cirrus measure derived from combining studies, the OR was 1.90 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.73 to 2.09), equivalent to a fourfold interquartile risk ratio, and was little attenuated after adjusting for conventional measures. In contrast, the OR for the conventional measure was 1.34 (95% CI = 1.25 to 1.43), and after adjusting for Cirrus it became 1.16 (95% CI = 1.08 to 1.24; Pâ€‰=â€‰4 Ã— 10-5).


Conclusions
A fully automated personal risk measure created from combining textural image features performs better at predicting breast cancer risk than conventional mammographic density risk measures, capturing half the risk-predicting ability of the latter measures. In terms of differentiating affected and unaffected women on a population basis, Cirrus could be one of the strongest known risk factors for breast cancer.",2018,JNCI Cancer Spectrum

Infini et phÃ©nomÃ¨ne: Sur quelques consÃ©quences phÃ©nomÃ©nologiques du finitisme mathÃ©matique de Wittgenstein,"Le but de notre expose est d'examiner le 
concept d'infini, tel qu'il est present chez 
certains phenomenologues, du point de vue de 
la philosophie wittgensteinienne de la 
mathematique. Le concept d'infini, de 
provenance a la fois metaphysique et 
mathematique, joue un role important surtout 
dans la phenomenologie de Levinas, aussi bien 
chez Husserl et, plus recemment, chez Richir 
et Tengelyi. Le dernier fonde sur le concept 
d'infini la possibilite meme de la metaphysique 
phenomenologique. Nous nous concentrons 
moins sur les differents usages de l'infini chez 
les philosophes respectifs, que sur la 
possibilite, avec Wittgenstein, d'oter le sens au 
concept d'infini issu des mathematiques, pour 
examiner l'impact possible de ce procede 
radical sur une phenomenologie de l'infini. La 
premisse sous-jacente de notre travail est la 
suivante: l'usage positif du concept d'infini 
dans la philosophie (la phenomenologie) 
presuppose une decision positive concernant ce 
concept dans les mathematiques ou la 
philosophie de la mathematique. Le sens 
mathematique de l'infini est le plus originaire 
et le plus comprehensible, il reste present dans 
toutes les acceptions suivantes que ce concept 
acquiert. Wittgenstein donne des arguments 
precis contre le concept d'infini actuel qui, 
ayant disparu des autres domaines, est toujours 
operant dans les mathematiques. Comme pour Aristote, l'infini actuel selon Wittgenstein est 
un pur contre-sens, d'ou Â« utter nonsense Â» de 
la theorie des ensembles, qui semble nourrir 
aujourd'hui certaines ontologies (Badiou, 
Meillassoux). Pour lui, l'infini n'a de sens que 
comme une regle (p.ex. une regle de calcul de 
la suite des nombres propre au developpement 
decimal d'un nombre irrationnel). Cette constatation veut-elle dire qu'il est possible de 
garder le sens d'infini potentiel ? Nous en 
doutons, etant donne la nature particuliere de la 
regle selon Wittgenstein. L'infini ne peut etre 
considere ni comme actuel, ni comme 
ouverture ou horizon qui echappe a nos efforts 
conceptuels, ni comme une arrivee inattendue 
d'un evenement du dehors. Dans la ligne de 
raisonnement wittgensteinien, nous essayerons

Associated with Cervical Abnormalities in Japanese Women High-Risk and Multiple Human Papillomavirus Infections,"To estimate the risk of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection for cervical malignancies, we conducted a case-control study in Japan. Abnormal cervical cell (366) and normal cell samples (1562) were tested for the presence of HPV DNA using a new PCR-based test (LCR-E7 PCR). When single HPV infections were considered, 26 different HPV types were identified in normal cervices and in low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL); whereas HPV-16, -18, -31, -33, -35, -45, -51, -52, -56, -58 and -67 were detected in high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) and in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the cervix, and HPV16 and -18 were detected in cervical adenocarcinoma. HPV-6 and -11 were detected in condyloma acuminatum tissue. In HSIL and SCC, HPV-16 was the most prevalent type and HPV-51, -52, and -58 were the next most prevalent; whereas HPV-39, -59, and -68 were not detected. Analysis by odds ratio (OR) revealed that HPV11, -39, -42, -44, -53, -59, -62, and -66 (HPV-66: OR,139; 95% confidence interval (CI) 5 6.7â€“168) were associated with LSIL; HPV-16, -18, -31, -51, -52 and -58 (HPV-16: OR, 69; 95%CI 5 36â€“131) were associated with SCC; and HPV-16 and -18 (OR, 94; 95%CI5 28â€“317) were associated with adenocarcinoma. Multiple HPV infection was associated with LSIL (OR, 24; 95%CI5 13â€“44), HSIL (OR, 16; 95%CI 5 8.4â€“32), and SCC (OR, 8.3; 95%CI 5 3.2â€“22), although the prevalence decreased with the grade of the lesions. All results suggest that HPV-6 and -11 are condyloma types, HPV-16, -18, -31, -51, -52, -58, and perhaps -33, -35, -45, -56, and -67, are the high-risk HPV types, and many other types are LSILassociated types in Japan. HPV typing and detection of multiple HPV infections in clinical samples may be useful as surrogate markers for cervical cell abnormalities. Introduction Cervical cancer is the fifth most frequently seen cancer and the second most common cancer in women worldwide (1). zur Hausenet al. (2) first showed that HPV 2 is closely associated with the development of cervical cancer. Many previous studies have shown that HPV-6 and -11 are associated with benign anogenital lesions, whereas HPV types 16 and 18 are associated with cervical cancer (3). Currently, more than 80 HPV types have been identified. More than 30 distinct HPV types are known to infect the genital tract, and at least 10 are associated with cancer (3). Therefore, the association between HPV infections and anogenital lesions is more complicated than expected. HPV types such as HPV-16, -18, -31, -33, -35, -39, -45, -51, -52, -56, -58, -59, and -68 are thought to be high-risk types because these types are identified in HSIL (4, 5) or invasive cervical cancer (6), whereas HPV-6, -11, -40, -42, -43, -44, and -55 are considered low-risk types (3, 7). Geographical differences in HPV types have been reported to exist between countries (6) and even within the United States (7, 8). Therefore, the HPV types prevalent in Japan may differ from those in Western countries (5, 9). Recent progress in molecular biology techniques prompted us to use a highly sensitive HPV DNA test as a supplementary test for cervical cancer screening, and to follow-up women with low-grade cervical lesions, such as LSIL (10), ASCUS, and AGUS (11â€“13). The clinicopathological grading of HPV types according to their ability to promote cancer is now the most important issue for many clinicians who use such HPV tests in cancer screening programs. However, the introduction of a highly sensitive assay revealed multiple HPV infections in women with abnormal cytology, and even in normal women (14, 15). Multiple HPV infections may cause confusion in determining which HPV types are responsible for the development of cervical lesions. We recently established a PCR-based system that is able to detect the E6-E7 DNA of more than 36 mucosal HPV types (16). Using this assay, we conducted a case-control study in Hokuriku, Japan, to elucidate the risk of individual HPV types for cervical cancer. In this study, we examined the prevalence of infection with a single HPV type or with multiple HPV types to clarify the association between HPV infection pattern and the stage of cervical lesions. Materials and Methods Study Population. Women were recruited to participate in a cervical cancer-screening program at four hospitals in the Hokuriku area of Japan (Fukui, Ishikawa, and Toyama prefecReceived 7/12/00; revised 10/2/00; accepted 10/18/00.

The case group consisted of 366 cytologically abnormal women (aged 19 to 75), including 145 LSILs, 137 HSILs, 72 SCCs, 12 ADCAs of the cervix, and 16 condyloma acuminata. We randomly chose an eligible sample of 1,562 women (aged 16 to 72) from the same population (483,500) that generated the cases. The control subjects were defined as women who had no past or current evidence of cervical neoplastic lesions, and had no clinical symptoms of any sexually transmitted diseases. Women who agreed to participate then signed informed consent forms approved by Kanazawa University School of Medicine. Sample Collection and Cytological and Histological Evaluation. Cervical cells were obtained from all women of normal and abnormal cytology, and 9 of 16 condyloma patients. The cervical cell scrapings were collected with a cytobrush from the ectoand endocervix of the uterus of each woman. After obtaining smeared cell slides for Pap test, the remaining cell samples on the cytobrush were suspended in PBS and stored at 270Â°C until DNA extraction. The final clinical diagnosis of the women with abnormal cytology was made by histological evaluation of biopsy samples obtained at colposcopy. The HPV detection and pathological diagnosis were performed independently. Smears were screened by two cytotechnologists. All possible abnormal smears and histological slides were reviewed independently by two surgical pathologists. The final diagnoses were determined by agreement of both pathologists using the Bethesda system (17). HPV Detection and Typing Using the PCR.The cervical cells were suspended in 50 m M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) with 10 mM EDTA containing 200mg/ml proteinase K and incubated overnight at 37Â°C for cell lysis. DNA was extracted from this lysis solution by the phenol-chloroform-isoamylalcohol method. To avoid contamination, we used disposable utensils and discarded them immediately after a single use. A reaction mixture without template DNA was included in every set of PCR runs as a negative control. Primers for a fragment of the b-actin gene served as an internal control to assess the quality and quantity of template DNA in each PCR specimen. The quality of DNA rendered 53 samples ineligible for the study, and these samples are not included in the numbers of case and control samples mentioned above. Four degenerate LCR forward primers (LCRF1, LCRF2, LCRF3, and LCRF4) and four E7 reverse primers (E7R1, E7R2, E7R3, and E7R4) were used to amplify E6-E7 DNA of most mucosal HPV types. One hundred ng of sample DNA were added to a 50ml PCR solution containing 20 m M Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 8 mM MgCl2, 7.5 mM DTT, 200 mM of each deoxynucleotide triphosphate, a mixture containing 20 pmoles each primer, and 0.25 units of KOD Dash DNA polymerase (Toyobo, Tokyo, Japan). For stable PCR amplification in clinical samples, we modified the procedure as follows: after denaturing the reaction solution containing no DNA polymerase for 2 min at 95Â°C, we cooled it on ice immediately, and then added the polymerase. PCR was then performed using an ASTEC PCR Thermal Cycler PC 707-02 (ASTEC, Fukuoka, Japan) with the following conditions. After a 1-min denaturing step at 95Â°C, the next 30â€“35 cycles were at 95Â°C for 45 s, 55Â°C for 20 s, and 74Â°C for 45 s. There was a final step at 74Â°C for 5 min. The amplified DNA samples were run on 2% classic type ME agarose (Nakarai, Japan) in Tris-borate EDTA buffer and transferred to nylon membranes (Hybond N1, Amersham, Japan) using the alkaline transfer method. The blotted membrane was hybridized with a mixture of four fluorescencelabeled, HPV-degenerated oligoprobes. The sequences of these probes were as follows: ( a) HPV-16R-AS, AATTGCTCATARCAGTAKAGRTCA; (b) HPV-18R-AS, TCWYTAAAWGCAAATTCAWATACCTC; (c) HPV-51/56-AS, AATTGYTCRTWGCATTGYAGGTCA; and ( d) HPV-6b/11-AS, CAATGDAARCAGCGACCCTTCCA (R, A/G; K, G/T; W, A/T; Y, C/T; D, G/A/T). Hybridized HPV DNA was visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit for fluorescence-labeled probes (Amersham, Japan). HPV typing was performed by an RFLP method using amplified DNA stained with ethidium bromide. HPV typing was performed by RFLP analysis on gels stained with ethidium bromide. The details of the RFLP typing method were as described previously (16). We performed RFLP analysis using hybridization on some samples, which had shown too-faint signals, with a mixture of E6-E7 DNA probes of HPV types 11, 16, 18, 31, 51, 52, 56, 58, 72, and 73.
