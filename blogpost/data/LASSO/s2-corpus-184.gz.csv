"Phylogenetic Profiling and Diversity of Bacterial Communities in the Death Valley, an Extreme Habitat in the Atacama Desert","Abstract
The Atacama Desert, one of the driest deserts in the world, represents a unique extreme environmental ecosystem to explore the bacterial diversity as it is considered to be at the dry limit for life. A 16S rRNA gene (spanning the hyper variable V3 region) library was constructed from an alkaline sample of unvegetated soil at the hyperarid margin in the Atacama Desert. A total of 244 clone sequences were used for MOTHUR analysis, which revealed 20 unique phylotypes or operational taxonomic units (OTUs). V3 region amplicons of the 16S rRNA were suitable for distinguishing the bacterial community to the genus and specie level. We found that all OTUs were affiliated with taxa representative of the Firmicutes phylum. The extremely high abundance of Firmicutes indicated that most bacteria in the soil were spore-forming survivors. In this study we detected a narrower diversity as compared to other ecological studies performed in other areas of the Atacama Desert. The reported genera were Oceanobacillus (representing the 69.5Â % of the clones sequenced), Bacillus, Thalassobacillus and Virgibacillus. The present work shows physical and chemical parameters have a prominent impact on the microbial community structure. It constitutes an example of the communities adapted to live in extreme conditions caused by dryness and metal concentrations

Electrochemical Sensor Based on Carbon Nanotubes for the Simultaneous Detection of Phenolic Pollutants,"Phenolic compounds are used extensively in industrialproducts, which can accumulate in the environment andthe ecological food chain via the consumption of thesecompounds by wildlife or uptake by plants [1]. Due totheir presence in water, air and food matrices, they repre-sent significant toxic risks to the environment and humanhealth [2,3]. Phenolic compounds exhibit variable toxici-ties and their detection and quantification are very impor-tant for evaluating the overall toxicity of environmentalsamples [2,4]. In particular, catechol, p-cresol and p-ni-trophenol compounds are included as priority pollutantsthat are monitored by international bodies, such as theUS Environmental Protection Agency and the EuropeanUnion [5,6]. These phenolic compounds are also of greatimportance in the food and medical industries and areclosely associated with the aesthetic and nutritional quali-ty of fresh and processed plant foods [7]. The inhibitoryeffect of phenolic compounds on mutagenesis and carci-nogenesis likely constitutes their most critical biologicalactivity [8,9]. Therefore, the development of a simple, re-liable and sensitive analytical technique is required forthe simultaneous detection and quantification of catechol,p-cresol and p-nitrophenol for both biological detectionand environmental protection.Several methods, such as high performance liquid chro-matography [10], flow-injection analysis [11], synchro-nous fluorescence [12], chemiluminescence [13], gas chro-matography-mass spectrometry [14], have been reportedfor the detection and quantification of isolated phenoliccompounds such as catechol, p-cresol and p-nitrophenol.In particular, chromatographic separation is generally re-quired prior for the detection of phenolic compounds[15]. Even though these methods are sensitive and selec-tive, they are time consuming, and often require expen-sive equipment that is generally not portable [16]. Re-cently, Yuan et al. [13] demonstrated that the electrogen-erated chemiluminescence (ECL) based detection of phe-nolic compounds such as hydroquinone, resorcinol, p-cresol, p-chlorophenol and o-bromophenol using a gra-phene/multiwall carbon nanotube/gold nanoclusterhybrid. It was reported that the fabricated sensor was uti-lized for various phenolic compounds; however, the pres-ent method cannot be applied to their simultaneous de-termination and discrimination. In contrast to these meth-ods, electrochemical techniques have a number of advan-tages in the detection and determination of chemical andbiological compounds, due to their rapid response,straightforward operation, time savings, and cost effec-tiveness [17â€“19]. In addition, when considering their criti-cal importance for practical use, electrochemical sensingdevices have the ability to perform real-time analysis forthe simultaneous sensing of phenolic compounds withinmixtures because of their inherent sensitivity and minia-turization, stability of performance and high compatibilitywith micro- and nanotechnologies [20,21].Owing to miniaturization, inexpensive instrumentation,excellent detection limits, high sensitivity and selectivity,carbon nanotube-based electrochemical sensors representa potentially powerful sensing approach, with applicationsin chemical and biochemical sensors, which have beenwidely reported [17,21,22]. Carbon nanotubes are a classof nanomaterials with unique geometrical, mechanical,Abstract: A mediator-free electrochemical sensing plat-form was designed by utilizing single-walled carbon nano-tube (SWCNT) modified glassy carbon (GC) electrodesfor the electrocatalytic oxidation of phenolic compounds.The proposed sensing platform permits the sensitive si-multaneous detection of catechol, p-cresol and p-nitro-phenol with the lowest detection limits of 2.3, 3.7 and7.7 nM, and high sensitivities of 135.08, 94.90 and110.38 mA/mM, respectively. The non-enzymatic electro-chemical sensor designed in this study also exhibited highstablility and reproducible as well as rapid response, pro-viding new opportunities for the development of sensingdevices in the detection of multiple phenolic compoundssimultaneously for practical environmental applications.",2015,Electroanalysis
"Sporo-pollen Assemblages of the Late Cretaceous Nong Bok Formation in Khammouane, Laos, and Their Environmental Significance for Salt Formation","This paper analyzes the spore and pollen in mudstone over the three rock salt layers of drill hole LH01 in the Longhu mining area,which lies in the Nong Bok depression of southeastern Sakhon Nakhon Basin.The authors recognized two sporo-pollen assemblages,i.e.,Exesipollenites-Classopllis-Ephedripites in mudstone over the middle and lower rock salt layers and Psophosphaera-Classopllis-Exesipollenites in mudstone over the upper rock salt layer.Based on analyzing the characteristics of the two sporo-pollen assemblages,the authors hold that the geological age of salt formation was between Turonian and Santonian of Late Cretaceous.Besides,the paleoflora reflected by the two spore-pollen assemblages suggests that the climate was very hot in the salt-forming period.Therefore,rock salt layers and mudstone were alternately developed and formed three cyclic depositions,and the change of sporo-pollen assemblage in upper mudstone indicates that the climate turned cool.",2013,
"Microfossil Assemblages throughout the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous from Well Haican-1,liupanshan Basin,ningxia,nw China","Well Haican-1 is located in the Xiaojiawan tectonic belt,Haiyuan Depression,Liupanshan Basin,Ningxia,and contains several Mesozoic units recognized from drilling cores. A sporopollen assemblage consisting of Pinuspollenites-Alisporites-Araucariacites indicates that the Anding Formation belongs to the Late Jurassic. An ostracode assemblage of Cypridea (Cypridea) unicostata-Cypridea (Ulwellia) koskulensis,a sporopollen assemblage of Pinuspollenites-Classopollis-Schizaeoisporites and numerous charophyte fossils (Peckisphaera paragranulifera) occur at the Heshangpu Formation. A charophyte assemblage of Aclistochara huihuibaoensis-Mesochara cf. voluta-Sphaerochara,a sporopollen assemblage of Classopollis-Cicatricosisporite-Granudiscus and ostracode fossils [Damonella cf. mediocris,Cypridea (Yumenia) sp. etc.] occur at the Liwaxia Formation. Based on these occurrences,the Heshang-pu and Liwaxia formations are of early-middle Early Cretaceous and can be correlated with the Hauterivian-Barremian. Additional charophyte fossils (Raskyaechara sp.,Obtusochara cf. subcylindrica etc.) occur at the Naijiahe Formation,suggesting this unit should be assigned to the Upper Cretaceous.",2010,
Robust Shaping Indirect Field Oriented Control for Induction Motor,"Over the past years, thanks to the systematic use of digital microprocessors in industry, we have seen a very significant development in the regulation controls of the asynchronous machine. The latter is widely used in industry for its diversity of use and its ability to withstand great variations in its nominal regime. Currently, several types of control are proposed. Nonlinear controls such as linearization input-output (Benchaib & Edwards, 2000) (Chan et al., 1990) (De Luca & Ulivi, 1989) (Marina & Valigi, 1991), the controls resulting from the theory of passivity (Nicklasson et al., 1997) (Gokdere, 1996) which generally require the measurement of all system states (currents and flux). As the flux of the motor cannot be measured, a great part of the literature is devoted to the control problem coupled with a nonlinear flux observer (Kanellakopoulos et al., 1992). Other controls using only the exit returns (rotor speed and stator currents) were developed resulting in controls of the passive type (Abdel Fattah & Loparo, 2003), other controls using the technique of backstepping or the techniques derived from the orientation of the flux field (Peresada et al., 1999) (Barambones et al., 2003). The parameters of such controls must be selected in order to ensure total stability for a given nominal running and nominal values of the parameters. Thus, different robust controls with parameter uncertainties, such as the discontinuous or adaptive controls, were developed (Marina et al., 1998). These techniques adapt the controls to the variations of resistances and the load couple. A control which is very common in industry is the indirect field oriented control (FOC) based on the orientation of the field of rotor flux. This control allows the decoupling of speed and flux, and we obtain linear differential equations similar to the D.C. machine. The regulation is carried out finally by simple controller PI (cf Fig. 1). However, the decoupling observed is only asymptotic. The behaviour of the transient regime and the total stability of the system remain a major problem. In addition, the modifications of parameters such as rotor resistance or resistive torque deteriorate the quality of decoupling. In this paper, we propose a diagram of ï‚¥ H regulation, linked to the field oriented control allowing a correct transient regime and good robustness against parameter variation to be 4",2010,

Lasso Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Parametric Models with Singular Information Matrices,An information matrix of a parametric model being singular at a certain true value of a parameter vector is irregular. The maximum likelihood estimator in the irregular case usually has a rate of convergence slower than the n -rate in a regular case. We propose to estimate such models by the adaptive lasso maximum likelihood and propose an information criterion to select the involved tuning parameter. We show that the penalized maximum likelihood estimator has the oracle properties. The method can implement model selection and estimation simultaneously and the estimator always has the usual n -rate of convergence.,2018,Econometrics
Applying â€œLassoâ€ Regression to Predict Future Glaucomatous Visual Field Progression in the Central 10 Degrees,"Purpose of the Study: We recently reported that it is beneficial to apply least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) regression to predict future 24-2 visual field (VF) progression. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the usefulness of Lasso regression to predict VF progression in the central 10 degrees (10-2) in glaucoma patients. Methods: Series of 10 VFs (Humphrey Field Analyzer 10-2 SITA-standard) from each of 149 eyes in 110 open angle glaucoma patients, obtained over 5.7Â±1.4 years (meanÂ±SD) were investigated. Mean deviation values of the 10th VF were predicted using varying numbers of VFs (ranging from the first to third VFs to the first to ninth VFs), applying ordinary least square regression (OLSLR) and Lasso regression. Absolute prediction errors were then compared. Results: With OLSLR, prediction error varied between 5.4Â±5.0 (using first to third VFs) and 1.1Â±1.6 dB (using first to ninth VFs). Significantly smaller prediction errors were obtained with Lasso regression, in particular with small numbers of VFs (from 2.1Â±2.8: first to third VFs, to 1.0Â±1.6 dB: first to ninth VFs). A large &lgr; value, which is an index showing the degree of penalty in Lasso regression, was observed when a small number of VFs were used for prediction. Conclusion: Mean deviation prediction using OLSLR with a small number of VFs resulted in large prediction errors. It was useful to apply Lasso regression when predicting future progression of the central 10 degrees, compared to OLSLR.",2017,Journal of Glaucoma
Agribusiness Intelligence: Grape Production Forecast Using Data Mining Techniques,"The agribusiness volatility is related to the uncertainty of the environment, rising demand, falling prices and new technologies. However, generation of agriculture data has increased over past years and can be used for a growing number of applications of data mining techniques in agriculture. The multidisciplinary approach of integrating computer science with agriculture will support the necessary decisions to be taken in order to mitigate risks and maximize profits. The present study analyzes different methods of regression applied in the study case of grapes production forecast. The selected methods were multivariate linear regression, regression trees, lasso and random forest. Their performance were compared against the predictions obtained by the company through the mean squared error and the coefficient of variation. The four regression methods used obtained better predictive results than the method used by the company with statistical significance < 0.5%.",2018,
Correlates of Alcohol Consumption and Drug Injection among Homeless Youth: A Case Study in the Southeast of Iran,"Background
Alcohol use and drug injection are prevalent among homeless youths. The aim of this study was to identify the associated factors of alcohol consumption and drug injection among homeless youths aged 18-29 years.


Methods
Data on 202 homeless youths (111 males and 91 females) were collected using a standardized questionnaire and face-to-face interview. Lasso logistic regression was applied to determine the impact of associated factors on alcohol consumption and drug injection.


Findings
The mean age of the participants was 26.30 Â± 3.19 years. Also, the prevalence of alcohol consumption and drug injection was 33.0% [95% confidence interval (CI): 30-36] and 4.0% (95% CI: 0-8), respectively; 6 people (3.0%) consumed alcohol and injected drugs at the same time. Correlates of alcohol consumption and drug injection were male sex [odds ratio (OR)Alc = 5.7], age (ORAlc = 0.96 and ORDI = 0.98), bachelor or higher education level (ORAlc = 1.34), non-Iranian nationality (ORAlc = 0.05 and ORDI = 0.18), food score (ORDI = 0.92), smoking (ORAlc = 2.05), substance use (ORAlc = 1.12), opposite sex relationship (ORAlc = 1.6), homosexual relationship (ORAlc = 3.56 and ORDI = 2.69), and mental disorder (ORAlc = 0.99).


Conclusion
Based on our findings, it seems that the homeless youth are more desired to use alcohol and drug injection, whereas the prevalence of alcohol consumption and drug injection in homeless youth was higher than general youth population in Iran. Therefore, some suitable solutions are needed to prevent the homelessness. Also, the effective variables that were identified in this study for alcohol use and drug injection can help design and implement beneficial interventions.",2019,Addiction & Health
Control Engineering Methods for the Design of Robust Behavioral Treatments,"In this paper, a robust control approach is used to address the problem of adaptive behavioral treatment design. Human behavior (e.g., smoking and exercise) and reactions to treatment are complex and depend on many unmeasurable external stimuli, some of which are unknown. Thus, it is crucial to model human behavior over many subject responses. We propose a simple (low order) uncertain affine model subject to uncertainties whose response covers the most probable behavioral responses. The proposed model contains two different types of uncertainties: uncertainty of the dynamics and external perturbations that patients face in their daily life. Once the uncertain model is defined, we demonstrate how least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) can be used as an identification tool. The lasso algorithm provides a way to directly estimate a model subject to sparse perturbations. With this estimated model, a robust control algorithm is developed, where one relies on the special structure of the uncertainty to develop efficient optimization algorithms. This paper concludes by using the proposed algorithm in a numerical experiment that simulates treatment for the urge to smoke.",2017,IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology

Naturschutz und Landschaftspolitik in Italien,"Italien bildet im Zentrum des Mittelmeerraums eine geografische Brucke zwischen dem Alpenraum und Afrika und verfugt deshalb im europaischen Vergleich uber eine besonders hohe Vielfalt an Okosystemen sowie an Tier- und Pflanzenarten. Vor allem Feuchtgebiete wie das Podelta oder die Sumpfgebiete in der Maremma sowie die Kustenokosysteme und Inseln bieten vielen seltenen Arten einen Lebensraum. Italien ist aus geologischer Sicht ein junges Land, hat jedoch eine sehr alte Kulturgeschichte. Die Landschaften sind deshalb in ihrem heutigen Aussehen stark vom Menschen uberformt. Ein sehr alter Eingriff, der bis heute das Landschaftsbild pragt, waren die grosflachigen Rodungen der Walder durch die Romer. Nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg, als sich die bebaute Flache innerhalb von zwanzig Jahren verdoppelte, hat sich die bis dahin fast ausschlieslich von der agrarischen Nutzung geformte Kulturlandschaft Italiens innerhalb weniger Jahrzehnte tief greifend verandert. Bereits in der Antike hat der Mensch damit begonnen, einzelne Gebiete unter Schutz zu stellen, z.B. in Form von heiligen Waldern. In Italien haben sich vor allem dort Walder erhalten, wo Konig und Adel Jagdschutzgebiete eingerichtet hatten. Inspiriert von den neu entstandenen Nationalparks in den USA, begann sich zu Beginn des 20. Jahrhunderts der Naturschutzgedanke auch in Europa auszubreiten. Im Jahr 1922 kam es zur Ausweisung des ersten italienischen Nationalparks (Parco nazionale), nachdem Konig Viktor Emanuel III auf seine Jagdrechte im Gran Paradiso-Gebiet verzichtet hatte. In den folgenden Jahren wurden drei weitere Nationalparks eingerichtet: der Nationalpark der Abruzzen (1923), des Circeo (1934), des Stilfser Jochs (1935) und drei Jahrzehnte spater der Nationalpark von Kalabrien (1968). Die schnelle Industrialisierung, die Zunahme des Tourismus und die damit einhergehende Veranderung der Bevolkerungsgeografie erfolgten in den ersten Jahrzehnten nach dem zweiten Weltkrieg weitgehend ohne Kontrolle durch eine Naturschutz- und Landschaftspolitik. In den 1970er- Jahren ging die gesetzgeberische und verwaltungstechnische Kompetenz fur den Arten- und Gebietsschutz sowie die Regional- und Landschaftsplanung an die Regionen uber. Nach dieser Starkung der Regionen kam es Ende der 1970er-Jahre zur Ausweisung verschiedener Regionalparks (Parco regionale). Schutzziele und Schutzpraxis waren jedoch regional sehr unterschiedlich. Insgesamt bestand bis Anfang der 1990er-Jahre eine uneinheitliche und unubersichtliche Situation in der Naturschutzpraxis.

Sparse cluster analysis of large-scale discrete variables with application to single nucleotide polymorphism data,"Currently, extreme large-scale genetic data present significant challenges for cluster analysis. Most of the existing clustering methods are typically built on the Euclidean distance and geared toward analyzing continuous response. They work well for clustering, e.g. microarray gene expression data, but often perform poorly for clustering, e.g. large-scale single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data. In this paper, we study the penalized latent class model for clustering extremely large-scale discrete data. The penalized latent class model takes into account the discrete nature of the response using appropriate generalized linear models and adopts the lasso penalized likelihood approach for simultaneous model estimation and selection of important covariates. We develop very efficient numerical algorithms for model estimation based on the iterative coordinate descent approach and further develop the expectationâ€“maximization algorithm to incorporate and model missing values. We use simulation studies and applications to the international HapMap SNP data to illustrate the competitive performance of the penalized latent class model.",2013,Journal of Applied Statistics
Forecasting Brazilian Inflation with High-Dimensional Models,"In this paper we use high-dimensional models, estimated by the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), to forecast the Brazilian inflation. The models are compared to Â benchmark specifications such as linear autoregressive (AR) and the factor models based on principal components. Our results showed that the LASSO-based specifications have the smallest errors for short-horizon forecasts. However, for long horizons the AR benchmark is the best model with respect to point forecasts. The factor model also produces some good long horizon forecasts in a few cases. We estimated all the models for the two most important Brazilian inflation measures, the IPCA and the IGP-M indexes. The results also showed that there are differences on the selected variables for both measures. Finally, the most important variables selected by the LASSO based models are, in general, related to government debt and money. On the other hand, variables such as unemployment and production were rarely selected by the LASSO.",2015,Brazilian Review of Econometrics
Overexpression of kinesin superfamily members as prognostic biomarkers of breast cancer,"Kinesin superfamily (KIFs) has a long-reported significant influence on the initiation, development, and progress of breast cancer. However, the prognostic value of whole family members was poorly done. Our study intends to demonstrate the value of kinesin superfamily members as prognostic biomarkers as well as a therapeutic target of breast cancer. Comprehensive bioinformatics analyses were done using data from TCGA, GEO, METABRIC, and GTEx. LASSO regression was done to select tumor-related members. Nomogram was constructed to predict the overall survival (OS) of breast cancer patients. Expression profiles were testified by quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Transcription factor, GO and KEGG enrichments were done to explore regulatory mechanism and functions. A total of 20 differentially expressed KIFs were identified between breast cancer and normal tissue with 4 (KIF17, KIF26A, KIF7, KIFC3) downregulated and 16 (KIF10, KIF11, KIF14, KIF15, KIF18A, KIF18B, KIF20A, KIF20B, KIF22, KIF23, KIF24, KIF26B, KIF2C, KIF3B, KIF4A, KIFC1) overexpressed. Among which, 11 overexpressed KIFs (KIF10, KIF11, KIF14, KIF15, KIF18A, KIF18B, KIF20A, KIF23, KIF2C, KIF4A, KIFC1) significantly correlated with worse OS, relapse-free survival (RFS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) of breast cancer. A 6-KIFs-based risk score (KIF10, KIF15, KIF18A, KIF18B, KIF20A, KIF4A) was generated by LASSO regression with a nomogram validated an accurate predictive efficacy. Both mRNA and protein expression of KIFs are experimentally demonstrated upregulated in breast cancer patients. Msh Homeobox 1 (MSX1) was identified as transcription factors of KIFs in breast cancer. GO and KEGG enrichments revealed functions and pathways affected in breast cancer. Overexpression of tumor-related KIFs correlate with worse outcomes of breast cancer patients and can work as potential prognostic biomarkers.",2020,Cancer Cell International
Construction of accurate machine learning force fields for copper and silicon dioxide.,"Recently, the machine learning force field has emerged as a powerful atomic simulation approach for its high accuracy and low computational cost. However, its applications in the multi-component materials are relatively less. In this study, the ML force fields are constructed for both elemental material (Cu) and binary material (SiO2). The atomic environments are described by the structural fingerprint that takes the bond angle into account, and then, different ML techniques, including linear regression, neural network and mixture model method, are used to learn the structure-force relationship. We found that the use of angular structural fingerprint and mixture model method significantly improves the accuracy of ML force fields. In addition, we discussed the effective structural fingerprints auto-selection method based on LASSO and the genetic algorithm. The atomic simulations carried out with ML force fields are in excellent agreement with ab initio calculations.",2018,arXiv: Materials Science
Interoperable geometry and mesh components for SciDAC applications,"Software components for representing and evaluating geometry (TSTTG/CGM) and finite element mesh (TSTTM/MOAB), and a higher-level component for relations between the two (TSTTR/LASSO), have been combined with electromagnetic modelling and optimization techniques, to form a SciDAC shape optimization application. The TSTT data model described in this paper allows components involved in the shape optimization application to be coupled at a variety of levels, from coarse black-box coupling (e.g. to generate a model accelerator cavity using TSTTG) to very fine-grained coupling (e.g. smoothing individual mesh elements based in part on geometric surface normals at mesh vertices). Despite this flexibility, the TSTT data model uses only four fundamental data types (entities, sets, tags, and the interface object itself). We elaborate on the design and implementation of effective components in the context of this application, and show how our simple but flexible data model facilitates these efforts.",2005,

Multi-dimensional transfer function design based on flexible dimension projection embedded in parallel coordinates,"In this paper, we present an effective transfer function (TF) design for multivariate volume, providing tightly coupled views of parallel coordinates plot (PCP), MDS-based dimension projection plots, and volume rendered image space. In our design, the PCP showing the data distribution of each variate dimension and the MDS showing reduced dimensional features are integrated seamlessly to provide flexible feature classification for the user without context switching between different data presentations. Our proposed interface enables users to identify interested clusters and assign optical properties with lassos, magic wand and other tools. Furthermore, sketching directly on the volume rendered images has been implemented to probe and edit features. To achieve interactivity, octree partitioning with Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), and other data reduction techniques are applied. Our experiments show that the proposed method is effective for multidimensional TF design and data exploration.",2011,2011 IEEE Pacific Visualization Symposium

"Multiculturalism, Religion, and Disability: Implications for Special Education Practitioners.","Religious beliefs permeate many aspects of culture. Often, however, educators are reluctant to discuss religious beliefs when working with children with developmental and intellectual disabilities and their families. Ignoring the salience of religious teachings about the nature and meaning of disabilities as they relate to both individuals and society, however, limits the opportunity to fully understand the experience of living with disability. Discussion of religious beliefs, traditions, and practices should be incorporated into teacher education, and should be part of the zeitgeist of working with children and families. This article examines images of and teachings about disabilities in three major world religions widely practiced in the United States; Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Spirituality and religion are important to millions of individuals across all cultures. Until recently, however, the spirituality of people with disabilities has been largely ignored by both communities of faith and secular social service and educational systems. (Avery-Wall, 2006; Rogers-Dulan, 1998; Stolberg, 2008) Neglecting the importance of religious belief and experience in the lives of many individuals with disabilities and their families, may imply a view of their innate humanity that is incomplete or less complex than other people (Swinton, 1997). Spiritual beliefs may greatly influence perceptions of people with disabilities, of themselves, others, and the world (Dellassoudas, 2000). Multicultural education and programs designed to build cultural competence must necessarily include instruction in religious practices and spiritual beliefs (Richards, Browne, & Forde, 2007). There is a growing body of literature in the helping professions around training practitioners to consider and understand the influence of religion on people with disabilities and their families as part of a system of care (Benjamins, 2005; Forster, McColl, & Fardella, 2007; Hurst, 2007; Selway & Ashman, 1998). Unfortunately, special education has thus far largely neglected considering religion as part of an evolving commitment to multicultural practice, and building cultural competence among students in teacher education programs. Religion in the Modern World Only recently has science advanced to the point where humans have a reasonably broad ability to mediate and manage the impact of the natural world in ways that are predictable and stable. People in the so-called developed world tend to believe that they have a fairly high degree of control over their health, lives, and destiny. We now know that vitamin A deficiency can cause blindness and that diet can prevent it. We know that the cognitive impact of phenylketonuria can be avoided through dietary manipulation and control. Technologies now allow 50 year old women to give birth to healthy babies and people without legs can be competitive runners (Robinson, 2008). Prior to the time when the degree of control that we can now exert over the natural and physical world was possible, people largely understood the world only as controlled by unseen, supernatural forces. Religion served to explain many of the mysteries of the natural world. The power to explain the unknown is also the power to control behavCorrespondence concerning this article should be addressed to Brooke Blanks, University of North Carolina at Greensboro, Department of Specialized Education Services, P.

Religious teaching often defines what people should believe to be true about the world around them, and it prescribes how people should act in accordance with these beliefs (Goldberg, 2006). Religious beliefs have been the foundations of civilizations. Public and private behaviors were usually governed by the codes of conduct described in religious law. It is relatively impossible to parse religious and civil leadership in ancient (and not so ancient) cultures. Even today despite public discourse around the need to maintain a secular, civil society in this country and elsewhere in the world, it is naive to underestimate the extent to which religious thought influences thinking on a wide variety of issues, including disability. To deny or ignore religious influences on conceptualizations of disability is to overlook a profound aspect of the human experience and our understanding of what it means to have and live with a disability. As special educators and researchers we are just beginning to explore the relationships between the influence of religion on cultural and personal understandings of disability.",2009,Education and Training in Developmental Disabilities
Gradient Projection for Sparse Reconstruction: Application to Compressed Sensing and Other Inverse Problems,"Many problems in signal processing and statistical inference involve finding sparse solutions to under-determined, or ill-conditioned, linear systems of equations. A standard approach consists in minimizing an objective function which includes a quadratic (squared ) error term combined with a sparseness-inducing regularization term. Basis pursuit, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), wavelet-based deconvolution, and compressed sensing are a few well-known examples of this approach. This paper proposes gradient projection (GP) algorithms for the bound-constrained quadratic programming (BCQP) formulation of these problems. We test variants of this approach that select the line search parameters in different ways, including techniques based on the Barzilai-Borwein method. Computational experiments show that these GP approaches perform well in a wide range of applications, often being significantly faster (in terms of computation time) than competing methods. Although the performance of GP methods tends to degrade as the regularization term is de-emphasized, we show how they can be embedded in a continuation scheme to recover their efficient practical performance.",2007,IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing
A greedy screening test strategy to accelerate solving LASSO problems with small regularization parameters,"In the era of big data remarked by high dimensionality and large sample size, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) problems demand efficient algorithms. Both static and dynamic strategies based on screening test principle have been proposed recently, in order to safely filter out irrelevant atoms from the dictionary. However, such strategies only work well for LASSO problems with large regularization parameters, and lose their efficiency for those with small regularization parameters. This paper presents a novel greedy screening test strategy to accelerate solving LASSO problems with small regularization parameters, as well as its effectiveness through adoption of a relatively larger regularization parameter which filters out irrelevant atoms in every iteration. Further more, the convergence proof of the greedy strategy is given, and the computational complexity of LASSO solvers integrated with this strategy is investigated. Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real data sets support the effectiveness of this greedy strategy, and the results show it outperforms both the static and dynamic strategies for LASSO problems with small regularization parameters.",2020,Soft Comput.
Restauro e progetto: il museo Archeologico dell'antica Volcei,"La seguente tesi si pone l'obiettivo di proporre un progetto di restauro conservativo e di ipotizzare una possibile rifunzionalizzazione del Convento di Sant'Antonio a Buccino, piccolo centro della provincia di Salerno. L'interesse per questo edificio, sorto alla fine del XIII secolo, prende avvio a seguito del terremoto che sconvolse l'Irpinia nel 1980. II convento, tipico esempio di architettura claustrale, fino a tale data, vedeva al suo interno allocati gli uffici comunali che, seppur con stravolgimenti dovuti alla diversa destinazione, ne hanno garantito la sopravvivenza. L'abbandono conseguente al sisma, che si protrae da oltre venticinque anni e l'assenza di qualsiasi intervento di manutenzione, sembrano destinare la struttura al totale collasso, con il rischio di vedere cancellata una testimonianza architettonica della Buccino medievale. 
 L'opportunita di realizzare un intervento che garantisca il recupero, la valorizzazione e la possibilita di fruizione, sono legate al riuso della struttura. Il riuso, da intendersi come mezzo attraverso il quale giungere alla conservazione, si inserisce nel progetto di Parco Archeologico Urbano che la Soprintendenza Archeologica di Salerno, Avellino e Benevento ha portato a compimento nel settembre 2003. I lavori di ricostruzione del centro storico hanno portato alla luce l'immenso patrimonio celato dalla citta attuale che, in una crescita stratificata e ininterrotta, ha conservato i resti delle antiche civilta, che fondarono il centro di Volcei. I cospicui ritrovamenti sia in termini quantitativi sia in termini di valore storico dei tanti reperti, che continuamente vengono alla luce, hanno posto l'esigenza di realizzare un Museo Archeologico funzionale alla loro conservazione alla loro esposizione in loco. 
 Il percorso di studio qui proposto e suddiviso nei seguenti punti: 
 1. L'analisi ambientale in cui l'oggetto di studio e inserito, con riferimenti specifici all'attivita sismica della regione, che ha caratterizzato la vita del piccolo centro. 
 2. La lettura storica del contesto territoriale con l'analisi delle fasi di strutturazione del contesto urbano e delle vicende, che ne hanno determinato gli sviluppi, dalla fondazione ai giorni nostri. 
 3. La lettura storica dell'oggetto di studio. In questo stadio sono stati reperiti tutti i documenti necessari a comprendere la storia del Convento e a documentarne le vicende costruttive. Questa fase e stata realizzata ricercando il materiale, oltre che nelle tradizionali biblioteche, in strutture quali: l'Archivio di Stato di Salerno, la Soprintendenza Archeologica di Salerno Avellino e Benevento, l'Archivio Comunale di Buccino, gli archivi parrocchiali del Comune di Buccino. 
 4. II progetto di conservazione nella fase operativa ha previsto la realizzazione del rilievo geometrico, (supportato da un rilievo realizzato dalla Soprintendenza), del rilievo fotografico e del degrado. Individuate le principali tipologie di degrado e i materiali costituenti l'edificio, il passo successivo e stata l'analisi delle cause di degrado e la proposta degli interventi in grado di eliminare tali cause, escludendo pero i piu invasivi. 
 Restauro e progetto: il Museo Archeologico dell'antica Volcei 
 5. II progetto di rifunzionalizzazione a Museo con l'analisi dell'inserimento urbanistico, in relazione ai percorsi del Parco Archeologico. Particolare attenzione e stata posta verso il recupero funzionale degli spazi interni del Convento, cercando di ricomporne la logica distributiva e realizzare intorno ad essa, il circuito espositivo.",2006,
Gender and sex independently associate with common somatic symptoms and lifetime prevalence of chronic disease.,"Sex and gender influence health differently. Associations between sex and health have been extensively studied, but gender (i.e. psychosocial sex) has been largely neglected, partly due to the absence of gender measures in cohort studies. Therefore, our objective was to test the unique associations of gender and sex with common somatic symptoms and chronic diseases, using a gender index created from existing cohort data. We applied LASSO logistic regression to identify, out of 153 unique variables, psychosocial variables that were predictive of sex (i.e. gender-related) in the Dutch LifeLines Cohort Study. These psychosocial variables covered gender roles and institutionalized gender. Using the estimated coefficients, gender indexes were calculated for each adult participant in the study (nÂ =Â 152,728; 58.5% female; mean age 44.6 (13.1) years). We applied multiple ordinal and logistic regression to test the unique associations of the gender index and sex, and their interactions, with common somatic symptoms assessed by the SCL-90 SOM and self-reported lifetime prevalence of chronic diseases, respectively. We found that in 10.1% of the participants the gender index was not in line with participants' sex: 12.5% of men and 8.4% of women showed a discrepancy between gender index and sex. Feminine gender characteristics are associated with increased common somatic symptoms and chronic diseases, especially in men. Female sex is associated with a higher common somatic symptom burden, but not with a higher prevalence of chronic diseases. The study shows that gender and sex uniquely impact health, and should be considered in epidemiological studies. Our methodology shows that consideration of gender measures in studies is necessary and feasible, based on data generally present in cohort studies.",2020,Social science & medicine
Prey density affects predator foraging strategy in an Antarctic ecosystem,"Studying the effects of prey distribution on predator behavior is complex in systems where there are multiple prey species. The role of prey density in predator behavior is rarely studied in closed ecosystems of one predator species and one prey species, despite these being an ideal opportunity to test these hypotheses. In this study, we investigate the effect of prey density on the foraging behavior of a predatory species in an isolated Antarctic ecosystem of effectively a single predatory species and a single prey species. We use resource selection models to compare prey density in areas utilized by predators (obtained from fine-scale GPS telemetry data) to prey density at randomly generated points (pseudoabsences) throughout the available area. We demonstrate that prey density of breeding Antarctic petrels (Thalassoica antarctica) is negatively associated with the probability of habitat use in its only predator, the south polar skua (Catharacta maccormicki). Skuas are less likely to utilize habitats with higher petrel densities, reducing predation in these areas, but these effects are present during chick rearing only and not during incubation. We suggest that this might be caused by successful group defense strategies employed by petrel chicks, primarily spitting oil at predators.",2020,Ecology and Evolution
Essai d'interprÃ©tation des coupes du Quaternaire rÃ©cent de l'oued El Akarit (Sud Tunisien),"Les coupes de l'oued El Akarit ont une importance considerable pour expliquer l'evolution geomorphologique et paleoclimatique du Sud-Tunisien depuis 40 000 ans. La presente etude a permis de preciser la succession de deux sequences sedimentaires, separees par une discordance de ravinement deja mise en evidence par W.D. Page (1972). GrÃ¢ce a une collaboration pluridisciplinaire, les environnements successifs de ces deux sequences ont ete analyses en detail. La premiere, a la fin du Pleistocene superieur, debute par une periode relativement humide dont l'Ã¢ge reste incertain malgre les essais de datation au 14C et la presence de gisements ""mousteriens"". La microfaune, en particulier les Foraminiferes, indique des milieux a salinite variable, en rapport avec une transgression probable du milieu marin (vers 27 000 BP ?). Cette sequence s'acheve par une sedimentation gypseuse (assechement du climat) et un creusement de la vallee (regression marine ?). La seconde sequence commence aussi par des depots hydromorphes, encore plus caracteristiques de milieux euryhalins a affinites thalassoides d'apres la microfaune, les Mollusques et probablement la microflore. Cet episode est bien date, entre 8 700 et 7 400 BP. Ici aussi, les pollens indiquent un couvert de steppe dominant, avec un leger accroissement des arbres vers 6 500-6 000 BP, juste avant le depot generalise de poussieres de gypse et l'installation d'un regime de sebkha. Une legere reprise du ruissellement et le depot de loess marquent la fin de cette extreme aridite et le retour a une vegetation steppique autour de 3 500 BP. Depuis 2 ou 3 millenaires, alors que le niveau marin reste eleve, on assiste a un creusement tres rapide, de 8 a 19 m, le long de cette vallees. 
En plus de cette reconstitution paleoclimatique, cette etude remet en cause l'interpretation et la datation du glacis 2 - forme majeure des piedmonts du Sud-Tunisien - et surtout le postulat d'une stabilite tectonique du seuil d'Oudref, entre les chotts et le golfe de Gabes.",1983,
Akumulacija kapitala i uvoz rada: pregled nekih marksistiÄkih pozicija u 1970-im god.,"In this paper the author discusses various Marxist views on the role of the reserve army of immigrant labour in relation to capitalist accumulation in Western Europe. Critical analysis is given of the theories of Claude Meillassoux, Andre Gorz, Marios Nikolinakos, Adriana Marshall, Stephen Castles and Godula Cosack. The author maintains that although most Marxist writers uphold the view that the contradictory position of immigrant workers as a reserve army of labour provides a basis for their ambiguous role in the economic and political class struggle that there is still disagreement in regard to defining this position in structural terms. It is argued that this disagreement is the result of generalizations made by observing different parts of the Western European reality. The author pursues this argument in two European contexts â€“ first, the Federal Republic of Germany and the Netherlands; second, the case of France.",2006,
"Structural and Functional Diversity of Microcins, Gene-Encoded Antibacterial Peptides from Enterobacteria","Microcins are a peculiar class of gene-encoded low-molecular-mass antibacterial peptides secreted by enterobacteria. They contribute to the regulation of microbial competitions within the intestinal microbiota. The genetic systems involved in microcin biosynthesis share a conserved organization. Similar to bacteriocins of Gram-positive bacteria, microcins exert potent antibacterial activity directed against phylogenetically-related bacterial strains, with minimal inhibitory concentrations in the nanomolar range. In contrast to bacteriocins, they display a great structural diversity among the few representatives well characterized until now, that makes difficult the description of microcin subclasses. This review focuses on three microcins, MccE492m that carries a C-terminal posttranslational modification containing a catechol-type siderophore, MccJ25, a cyclic peptide with a unique â€˜lasso-typeâ€™ structure and MccC7 or C51, with a common N-formylated heptapeptide-nucleotide structure. We show these microcins exhibit â€˜Trojan horseâ€™ mechanisms of antibacterial activity: either (i) the microcin structure is a mime of an essential element, permitting its recognition by outer membrane receptors used for vital functions in bacteria and further translocation into the periplasmic space, or (ii) it is secreted as a harmless molecule and further processed in susceptible bacteria to form the toxic entity. When inside target bacteria, microcins bind essential enzymes or interact with the inner membrane to form a bacterial killing structure.",2007,Journal of Molecular Microbiology and Biotechnology
Efficient Regularized Regression for Variable Selection with L0 Penalty,"Variable (feature, gene, model, which we use interchangeably) selections for regression with high-dimensional BIGDATA have found many applications in bioinformatics, computational biology, image processing, and engineering. One appealing approach is the L0 regularized regression which penalizes the number of nonzero features in the model directly. L0 is known as the most essential sparsity measure and has nice theoretical properties, while the popular L1 regularization is only a best convex relaxation of L0. Therefore, it is natural to expect that L0 regularized regression performs better than LASSO. However, it is well-known that L0 optimization is NP-hard and computationally challenging. Instead of solving the L0 problems directly, most publications so far have tried to solve an approximation problem that closely resembles L0 regularization. 
In this paper, we propose an efficient EM algorithm (L0EM) that directly solves the L0 optimization problem. $L_0$EM is efficient with high dimensional data. It also provides a natural solution to all Lp p in [0,2] problems. The regularized parameter can be either determined through cross-validation or AIC and BIC. Theoretical properties of the L0-regularized estimator are given under mild conditions that permit the number of variables to be much larger than the sample size. We demonstrate our methods through simulation and high-dimensional genomic data. The results indicate that L0 has better performance than LASSO and L0 with AIC or BIC has similar performance as computationally intensive cross-validation. The proposed algorithms are efficient in identifying the non-zero variables with less-bias and selecting biologically important genes and pathways with high dimensional BIGDATA.",2014,ArXiv
Tumour Suppressors: Multi-tasking,"first tumour suppressor gene to be identified and is required to limit the activity of E2f transcription factors and prevent proliferation. However, the function of RB has proved to be more complex, as three recent papers have highlighted. RB can induce apoptosis in response to genotoxic stress, but how it achieves this has not been established. Jackie Lees, Alberto Gulino and colleagues used a variety of techniques to address this question. They found that DNA damaging agents, such as doxorubicin, induced formation of a RBâ€“E2F1 complex in both proliferating and non-proliferating cells. Although RB can bind to both pro-apoptotic genes and cell cycle regulatory genes after treatment with doxorubicin, RB repressed the cell cycle genes through the recruitment of histone deacetylase 1 and induced transcription of pro-apoptotic genes such as CASP7 and TP73 as a result of recruitment of E2F1, RNA polymerase II and the histone acetyltransferase PCAF. Indeed, a partial knockdown of RB1 reduced the fraction of cells undergoing apoptosis in response to either doxorubicin or etoposide in vitro. Similar results were found in vivo, with Rb1-null or heterozygous epithelial cells in the small intestine showing reduced levels of apoptosis in response to doxorubicin compared with wild type. Thus, changes in the level of RB expression in vivo can alter the response to DNA damaging agents owing to reduced levels of pro-apoptotic proteins. A second publication indicates that the maintenance of contact inhibition by Rb family members might also be a novel tumour suppressor function. Douglas Dean and colleagues found that mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) lacking expression of RB, RBL1 (p107) and RBL2 (p130) (triple knockout (TKO)) are not contact inhibited and form spheres in culture. Although Rb1-null MEFs undergo contact inhibition and do not naturally form these spheres, they can be forced to. Under these conditions they develop a stem cell-like phenotype, as do the TKO MEFs, and this remains evident once these cells are replated, suggesting that growth in spheroid cultures leads to the reprogramming of these cells. Further characterization of Rb1-null sphere cells revealed that a minority of the cells had characteristics of side population cells, which are thought to be stem cells. Rb1-null side population cells isolated from the spheres expressed the embryonic stem cellassociated genes Oct4 (Pou5f1) and Nanog. Significantly, injection of the Rb1-null side population cells into nude mice produced spindle cell sarcomas, and small clusters of cells throughout the tumours retained expression of OCT4 and NANOG. These and other data indicate that these side population cells are possible cancer stem cells and these results imply that, by maintaining contact inhibition, Rb family members can prevent cellâ€“cell interactions that promote a cancer stem cell phenotype. Chiaki Takahashi and colleagues have examined the pathways that cells activate to limit cell proliferation and transformation when RB function is compromised. Rb1 heterozygous mice, which develop Rb1-null thyroid C cell adenomas, only develop C cell adenocarcinomas following biallelic loss of Nras. Why is NRAS loss required for tumour progression? These authors show that Rb1 loss in C cell adenomas results in E2f-mediated aberrant expression of several proteins involved in isoprenylation. This results in increased isoprenylation and activation of NRAS, which triggers senescence through a RBL2-dependent pathway. Moreover, loss of genes involved in senescence such as Arf or Ink4a also induce C cell adenocarcinoma formation in Rb1-heterozygous mice. These findings indicate that carcinogenesis induced by Rb1 loss is restricted by senescence and that RB limits cell transformation in part by restricting activation of NRAS. All three papers show that the days when RB was thought of as a simple brake on cell cycle progression are long gone.",2009,Nature Reviews Cancer
Urmia Lake (Northwest Iran): a brief review,"Lake Urmia (or Ormiyeh) is one of the largest hypersaline lakes in the world and the habitat of a unique bisexual Artemia species (A. urmiana). Despite this, and several other values of the lake, little literature on it has been published. The present paper is an attempt to provide a brief review on various aspects of the lake. Urmia Lake, located in northwestern Iran, is an oligotrophic lake of thalassohaline origin with a total surface area between 4750 and 6100 km2 and a maximum depth of 16 m at an altitude of 1250 m. The lake is divided into north and south parts separated by a causeway in which a 1500-m gap provides little exchange of water between the two parts. Due to drought and increased demands for agricultural water in the lake's basin, the salinity of the lake has risen to more than 300 g/L during recent years, and large areas of the lake bed have been desiccated. Therefore, management and conservation of this incomparable ecosystem should be considered to improve the current condition by fisheries research institutes.",2007,Saline Systems
Global Geodetic Observing System (GGOS) Science Rationale,"Introduction. â€œ Living On a Restless Planetâ€, this is the theme of the published report of theNASA Solid Earth Science Working Group (2002). Indeed, the Earth with its atmosphere,oceans, ice covers, land surfaces and its interior is restless. It is subject to a multitude ofdynamic processes that cover a broad variety of spatial and temporal scales and are driven bylarge interior and exterior forces. In modern times these processes are influenced, as well, byman-made effects; to what extent is still largely unknown. Earthquakes, volcano eruptions,tectonic deformations, land slides, de-glaciation, sea level rise, floods, desertification, storms,global warming and many more are typical and well known phenomena of this highly dynamicengine. All of them affect our life and the life of future generations. Major decisions facinghuman societies will depend on a much deeper understanding of this complex system and largeinternational efforts on governmental and scientific levels are currently underway towards thisgoal.The international geodetic community, organized under the umbrella of the InternationalAssociation of Geodesy (IAG), is preparing to contribute a new and very important segment tothe study of system Earth. It will provide on a global scale the spatial and temporal changes ofthe shape of our planet, of the oceans, ice covers and land surfaces. In other words, it will be aglobal picture of surface dynamics of our planet. It will provide, in addition, an assessment ofmass anomalies, of mass transport and of mass exchange processes in the Earthâ€™s system. Thesetwo elements together are the key to global mass balance determination and an importantcontribution to the understanding of the global energy budget. IAG will achieve this byestablishing a Global Geodetic Observing System (GGOS). GGOS will fully exploit (and try toextend) the unique constellation of satellite missions relevant to this goal, that is in orbit nowand during the next decade by integrating them into one measurement system, Table 1. Thebackbone of this integration is the existing global ground network, based on the geodetic spacetechniques VLBI, SLR, GPS and DORIS. GGOS will complement the space segment andglobal ground network by airborne and terrestrial campaigns that serve the purpose ofcalibration and validation and, equally important, regional densification and refinement.Assimilation of these observations into models of weather, climate, ocean, hydrological, ice andsolid Earth will fundamentally enhance the understanding of the role of surface changes andmass transport for the dynamics of our planet.",2005,
Cross-sectional and longitudinal association between types of meniscal pathology and knee pain: Data from the osteoarthritis initiative,"s / Osteoarthritis and Cartilage 23 (2015) A82eA416 A277 434 CROSS-SECTIONAL AND LONGITUDINAL ASSOCIATION BETWEEN TYPES OF MENISCAL PATHOLOGY AND KNEE PAIN: DATA FROM THE OSTEOARTHRITIS INITIATIVE B.

Tasmania, Hobart, Australia; xMichael E. DeBakey VA Med. Ctr. and Baylor Coll. of Med., Houston, TX, USA; kBrown Univ. Sch. of Med., Providence, RI, USA Purpose: Meniscal pathology increases the risk for the incidence and progression of knee osteoarthritis but is only weakly related to knee pain. However, the association of meniscal pathology with knee pain has primarily been analyzed based on the presence or absence of meniscal pathology, which does not account for the type of meniscal pathology. We hypothesize that certain types of meniscal pathology may relate to knee pain andmay predict change in knee pain. The aim of this study was to explore the association of different types of knee meniscal pathology with knee pain and change in knee pain over 2 years. Methods: We selected a convenience sample of the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) who had complete data for the OAI Bone Ancillary Project. The right knee was selected as the index knee unless there was a contraindication for magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. A single experienced fellowship trained musculoskeletal radiologist reviewed the 24-month OAI MR images for meniscal pathology by location (i.e., anterior, body, and posterior horn) within the medial and lateral menisci using a modified International Society of Arthroscopy, Knee Surgery, and Orthopaedic Sports Medicine (ISAKOS) meniscal tear classification system. For analyses, we reclassified the 10 original ISAKOS categories into 5 categories: normal, degenerative signal, morphological deformity, any tear (i.e., horizontal, horizontal flap, vertical-longitudinal, radial, radial-longitudinal, complex tear), and maceration. To replicate prior studies, we explored whether the presence or absence of any meniscal pathology in a knee was associated with pain. Total number of regions affected by meniscal pathology for each knee (0-6) was calculated by counting the number of regions that had pathologic findings. Knee pain was assessed using Western Ontario andMcMaster Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) scale at 24 and 48 months. Knee pain at 24 months was categorized into 3 categories: 1) no or little pain (WOMAC pain score 0 or 1), 2) mild pain (WOMAC pain score 2 or 3), 3) moderate-severe pain (WOMAC pain score > 3). Longitudinally, we categorized the change in pain into 3 categories based on the presence or absence of pain and a clinically meaningful change in pain (absolute change of 2 or relative change of 40%): 1) no pain or a meaningful decrease in pain (reference category), 2) pain but no change over time, and 3) meaningful increase in pain. Ordinal logistic regression was performed to determine the association of baseline meniscal pathology with knee pain and change in knee pain over 2 years. All models were adjusted for age, sex, and bodymass index (BMI). Results: 465 participants were included in the analysis with mean age of 63.2 (9.1) years, 53% male, mean BMI 29.5 (4.5) kg/m2, 71% KL grade >1â„42, and 86% with any type of meniscal pathology. Tables below show the associations of meniscal pathology with knee pain (Table 1) and change in knee pain (Table 2). There was no association between presence of any meniscal pathology with knee pain or change in knee pain. Having all six meniscal regions affected with any pathology was associated with greater pain (OR:2.65) compared to those with normal menisci. However, having more affected meniscal regions was not related to an increase in pain. This pattern persisted when the number of regions affected by maceration was analyzed cross-sectionally and longitudinally. When we assessed the types of meniscal pathology, cross-sectionally, the only significant associationwas betweenmeniscal maceration and greater knee pain (OR:2.89). Longitudinally, there was a significant association between morphological deformity (OR:1.46) and increase in knee pain over 2 years. Removing surgery or injury cases did not change our results. Conclusions: These results suggest that meniscal maceration is associated with higher knee pain that may not change over time. However, we hypothesize that morphological deformity may lead to maceration over time, which may explain why morphologic deformity is associated with an increased pain over time. Further prospective studies are warranted to determine if discrete tear incidence is related to acute knee pain and if a subset of knees can then function without pain.

Wang, Y. Feng, Q. Hua, W. Kramer, N. Barnthouse. Univ. of Kansas Med. Ctr., Kansas City, KS, USA Purpose: The risk of posttraumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) after joint injuries ranges from 20% to more than 50% evenwith the best current care of joint injuries. The risk of PTOA increases with age of patients, suggesting thatbiologic factorsmaybe involved in theprogressionof PTOA.However, the key biologic factors responsible for PTOA progression remain unclear. NFAT1 (NFATc2) is a member of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) family of transcription factors originally identified as a regulator of the expression of cytokine genes during the immune response. Our recent studies revealed that mice lacking NFAT1 exhibit normal skeletal development but display dysfunction of articular chondrocytes and OA-like changes in adults,withearlyosteoarthritic changes in the knee joints after 6-8months of age. This study aimed to test our hypothesis that the global NFAT1 expression level affects the time of onset and progression of knee PTOAafter surgical destabilizationof themedialmeniscus (DMM) inmice. Methods: We generated bilateral DMM by surgical transection of the medial meniscotibial ligament (MMTL) in 2 to 3-month-old Nfat1 knockout (Nfat1-/-), Nfat1Ã¾/-, and wild-type (WT) mice. All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Animals were anesthetized by intra-peritoneal injection of ketamine and xylazine. Under a surgical microscope, the knee joint was exposed through a medial parapatellar incision under sterile conditions. The MMTL was transected with micro-surgical scissors to destabilize the medial meniscus. For sham surgery, the MMTL was visualized but not transected. The joint capsule was closed with 8-0 resorbable Vicryl sutures and the skin incision closed with 5-0 non-resorbable sutures. Operated animals were allowed caged mobility after surgery and were monitored to ensure healthy recovery. Animals were euthanized at 4, 8, and 16 weeks after surgery. The knee joints were harvested and processed for histochemical and histomorphometric analyses to evaluate the severity of knee osteoarthritis (OA). Articular cartilage samples harvested from the medial femoral condyle and medial tibial plateau were processed for gene expression analyses by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Statistical analyses were performed with Student t-test and ANOVA. Results: Tissue sections stained with safranin-O and fast green were used for histomorphometric analyses to determine the severity of knee OA. We utilized a semi-quantitative OA grading scale as previously described (Glasson et al. Osteoarthritis Cartilage 2007; 15:1061). After the DMM surgery, Nfat1-/and Nfat1Ã¾/mice displayed earlier onset of OA and significantly more severe OA in the knee joints than WT mice. The osteoarthritic changes such as cartilage lesions and chondroosteophyte formation were more apparent on the medial side than the lateral side of the knee joint in all three groups. Nfat1-/-, Nfat1Ã¾/-, and WT mice receiving the sham surgery displayed focal loss of safranin-O staining in the articular cartilage of the knee joints at 4 and 8 weeks but recovered at 16 weeks without apparent osteoarthritic changes. qPCR analyses demonstrated that expression levels of Col10a1 (a marker of hypertrophic chondrocytes) and specific pro-inflammatory cytokines",2015,Osteoarthritis and Cartilage
Bayesian Learning Based Millimeter-Wave Sparse Channel Estimation with Hybrid Antenna Array,"We consider the problem of millimeter-wave (mmWave) channel estimation with a hybrid digital-analog two-stage beamforming structure. A radio frequency (RF) chain excites a dedicated set of antenna subarrays. To compensate for the severe path loss, known training signals are beamformed and swept to scan the angular space. Since the mmWave channels typically exhibit sparsity, the channel response can usually be expressed as a linear combination of a small number of scattering clusters. Thereby the number of angles of arrival (AoAs) and angles of departure (AoDs) with significant signal components is limited, and compressive sensing techniques can be leveraged for estimating the channel. In this paper, we investigate two sparse recovery algorithms: a Bayesian and non-Bayesian one. In the Bayesian approach, we invoke the sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) framework, which relies on a 2-layer hierarchical prior model for channel. A highly efficient and fast iterative Bayesian inference method is then applied to the proposed model. The non-Bayesian approach is a LASSO-based approach, where we devise a low complexity solution by adopting alternating directions method of multipliers (ADMM) technique to solve the problem. The efficacy of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated using numerical examples. The Bayesian approach shows improved estimation performance in relation to the non-Bayesian approach.",2018,2018 IEEE 19th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)
Adaptive group Lasso for high-dimensional generalized linear models,"Variable selection in a grouped manner is an attractive method since it respects the grouping structure in the data. In this paper, we study the adaptive group Lasso in the frame of high-dimensional generalized linear models. Both the number of groups diverging with the sample size and the number of groups exceeding the sample size are considered. The selection consistency and asymptotic normality of the adaptive group Lasso are established under appropriate conditions. Simulation studies confirm superior performances of the adaptive group Lasso.",2017,Statistical Papers
Reconstruction of Complex Directional Networks with Group Lasso Nonlinear Conditional Granger Causality,"Reconstruction of networks underlying complex systems is one of the most crucial problems in many areas of engineering and science. In this paper, rather than identifying parameters of complex systems governed by pre-defined models or taking some polynomial and rational functions as a prior information for subsequent model selection, we put forward a general framework for nonlinear causal network reconstruction from time-series with limited observations. With obtaining multi-source datasets based on the data-fusion strategy, we propose a novel method to handle nonlinearity and directionality of complex networked systems, namely group lasso nonlinear conditional granger causality. Specially, our method can exploit different sets of radial basis functions to approximate the nonlinear interactions between each pair of nodes and integrate sparsity into grouped variables selection. The performance characteristic of our approach is firstly assessed with two types of simulated datasets from nonlinear vector autoregressive model and nonlinear dynamic models, and then verified based on the benchmark datasets from DREAM3 Challenge4. Effects of data size and noise intensity are also discussed. All of the results demonstrate that the proposed method performs better in terms of higher area under precision-recall curve.",2017,Scientific Reports

Amphibian and reptilian records from south-central Mali and western Burkina Faso,"While the forests of the Upper Guinean region of West Africa have been the focus of much herpetofaunal attention in recent decades (e.g., Penner et al. 2011), many areas of landlocked West Africa remain under-surveyed. Some work has been done on a number of these countries, for example, Guinea-Bissau (Auliya et al. 2012), Senegal (Joger & Lambert 2002), Guinea (BÃ¶hme 2000, RÃ¶del et al. 2004, Greenbaum & Carr 2005, Hillers et al. 2008, BÃ¶hme et al. 2011); relatively little, however, has been published on the herpetofauna of Mali and Burkina Faso when compared with their southern neighbours. For Mali, Joger & Lambert (1996, 1997) provided an annotated checklist and analysis of the diversity and biogeography of the herpetofauna, while BÃ¶hme et al. (1996) provided some additional records for both countries. RÃ¶del (2000) described the West African frog fauna and listed country records for each species, including Mali and Burkina Faso. Chirio (2009) gave records for the geographic triangle formed by Niger, Benin and Burkina Faso where the border-crossing â€œW Transfrontier Biosphere Reserveâ€ (â€œRÃ©serve de BiosphÃ¨re TransfrontaliÃ¨re du Wâ€, RBTW) is situated. More recently, Trape & ManÃ© (2006) and Trape et al. (2012) provided updated distribution maps at a one-degree scale for snakes and other reptiles respectively, for all West African countries. Mediannikov et al. (2012) revised the genus Agama all over West Africa with an integrative approach which is, however, partly in conflict with the results of Wagner et al. (2009) and LeachÃ© et al. (2014). Finally, Trape & ManÃ© (2017) published a summarising paper on the snake fauna of Mali. Here, we report on some herpetological voucher material from Mali and Burkina Faso (Fig. 1) that has entered the Zoologisches Forschungsmuseum Alexander Koenig (ZFMK) in Bonn after 1996, since the publication of a first note on this topic happened 22 years ago (BÃ¶hme et al. 1996). Our Malian records were made by Jeffrey Heath and two native collaborators (Seydou Moro and Oumar Pergourou, see below) in September 2009, July 2010 and on various occasions in 2011 and 2012 in the Dogon Province, southern Mali, at SÃ©varÃ© near Mopti (14Â°32â€™N, 04Â°06â€™W) and in the following villages of the area between Douentza and Bandiagara: â€“ Anda near Douentza (14Â°49â€™N, 03Â°01â€™W) is nested at the base of a small rocky hill (inselberg).

Abstract. Some amphibians and reptiles from southern Mali and southwestern Burkina Faso have been deposited in the Zoologisches Forschungsmuseum Alexander Koenig (ZFMK) since the year 2000. Supplemented by some photographic voucher material they contain several remarkable, in some cases even new records for the two respective countries. Malian specimens were collected mainly in the region between Douentza and Bandiagara in the south-central part of the country, while those from Burkina Faso are from the Bobo Dioulasso area in the southwestern part of the country. Three amphibian species are new for Maliâ€™s faunal list (Leptopelis bufonides, Ptychadena trinodis, Pyxicephalus sp. as the first representative of its genus). Two specimens of a small-sized Agama species cannot yet be assigned to a described species with certainty but are in any case of zoogeographical interest. A specimen of Chamaeleo gracilis documents the second record of this species for Burkina Faso, the first one in the western part of the country. The slender blind snake Leptotyphlops albiventer is recorded for the first time for this country.",2018,
Compression of cerebral vessels by intracranial hypertension II. Morphological evidence for collapse of vessels,"SummaryIntracranial vessels have been examined in monkeys in which brain swelling and intracranial hypertension were produced by gradual expansion of an extradural balloon. The heads were frozen in liquid nitrogen at the time of sacrifice and subsequently sectioned in stereotaxic coronal planes. The most conspicuous vascular alterations were collapse of the sagittal sinus and severe constriction of the straight sinus in those preparations with complete cerebral decompensation. In one preparation, the pericallosal artery was collapsed, probably due to expansion of the brain and obliteration of the supracallosal cistern. The lumens of many small arteries and veins in sulci and on the cortical surface were also obliterated whereas other small vessels were unaffected. The contribution of cerebrovascular collapse to the ischemia produced by brain swelling and intracranial hypertension is discussed.ZusammenfassungDie intrakraniellen GefÃ¤ÃŸe von Affen wurden untersucht, bei denen eine Hirnschwellung und eine intrakranielle Drucksteigerung durch allmÃ¤hlich zunehmendes Aufblasen eines extraduralen Ballons hervorgerufen worden war. Die SchÃ¤del wurden im Augenblick der TÃ¶tung in flÃ¼ssigem Stickstoff gefroren und in der Folge in Serie geschnitten. Der auffallendste Befund seitens des vaskulÃ¤ren Systems war ein Kollaps des Sinus sagittalis und eine erhebliche Konstriktion des Sinus rectus bei den Versuchstieren, bei denen es zu einer vollstÃ¤ndigen zerebralen Dekompensation gekommen war. In einem Fall war die A. pericallosa kollabiert, wahrscheinlich bedingt durch die Ausdehnung des Gehirns mit Verlegung der Balkencisterne. Die Lumina vieler kleiner Arterien und Venen in den Furchen und an der OberflÃ¤che des Kortex waren ebenfalls verlegt, wÃ¤hrend andere kleine GefÃ¤ÃŸe nicht beeintrÃ¤chtigt waren. Die Bedeutung des Kollapses der zerebralen GefÃ¤ÃŸe im Zusammenhang mit der IschÃ¤mie, die durch Hirnschwellung und intrakranielle Drucksteigerung entsteht, wird diskutiert.ResumÃ©Nous avons examinÃ© des vaisseaux intra-crÃ¢niens de singes chez lesquels l'oedÃ¨me cÃ©rÃ©bral et l'hypertension intrac Ã¢nienne Ã©taient chez lesquels l'oedÃ¨me cÃ©rÃ©bral et l'hypertension intrac Ã¢nienne Ã©taient profus par l'expansion progressive d'un ballon extra-dural. Les crÃ¢nes furent congelÃ©s dans de l'azote liquide au moment de la mort et, par la suite, mis en coupes suivant des plans stÃ©rÃ©otaxiques. Les altÃ©rations vasculaires les plus remarquables furent le collapsus du sinus sagittal, et une grave stÃ©nose du sinus droit dans ces prÃ©parations avec dÃ©compensation cÃ©rÃ©brale complÃ¨te.Dans l'une de ces prÃ©parations, l'artÃ¨re pÃ©ricalleuse Ã©tait collabÃ©e, probablement Ã  cause de l'expansion de l'oedÃ¨me cÃ©rÃ©bral et de l'oblitÃ©ration de la citerne supracalleuse. La lumiÃ¨re de beaucoup d'artÃ©rioles et veinules Â«in sulciÂ» et sur la surface corticale Ã©taient aussi oblitÃ©rÃ©s, alors que d'autres petits vaisseaux Ã©taient inaltÃ©rÃ©s. La contribution du collapsus vasculaire cÃ©rÃ©bral Ã  l'ischÃ©mie produite par l'oedÃ¨me cÃ©rÃ©bral et l'hypertension intracrÃ¢nienne est discutÃ©e.RiassuntoI vasi sanguigni endocranici furono esaminati in scimmie, nelle quali erano stati provocati, mediante graduale espansione di un'ernia extradurale, rigonfiamento del cervello ed ipertensione endocranica.Le teste degli animali vennero congelate in azoto liquido subito dopo il sacrificio e successivamente sezionate stereotassicamente in senso parallelo alla coronale.La maggiore alterazione vasale riscontrata era il collasso (collabimento) del seno sagittale, nonchÃ¨ una forte costrizione del seno retto, con completa decompensazione cerebrale.In una sezione l'arteria pericallosa collabiva, probabilmente come conseguenza dell'espansione del cervello e dell'obliterazione dela cisterna supercallosa. Il lume di molte piccole arterie e molti piccoli vasi nel solco e sulla superficie corticale erano del pari obliterati, mentre altri piccoli vasi risultavano indenni.Viene discussa l'influenza del collabimento cerebro-vascolare sulla ischemia da rigonfiamento del cervello e dalla ipertsnsione endocranica.ResumenExaminamos los vasos intracraneales de monos, a los cuales se habÃ­a producido edema e hipertensiÃ³n intracraneal, mediante la expansiÃ³n progresiva de un balon extradural.

Mining the Breast Cancer Proteome for Predictors of Drug Sensitivity,"Approximately 20 drugs have been approved by the FDA for breast cancer treatment, yet predictive biomarkers are known for only a few of these. The identification of additional biomarkers would be useful both for drugs currently approved for breast cancer treatment and for new drug development. Using glycoprotein expression data collected via mass spectrometry, in conjunction with statistical models constructed by elastic net or lasso regression, we modeled quantitatively the responses of breast cancer cell lines to ~90 drugs. Lasso and elastic net regression identified HER2 as a predictor protein for lapatinib, afatinib, gefitinib and erlotinib, which target HER2 or the EGF receptor, thus providing an internal control for the approach. Two additional protein datasets and two RNA datasets were also tested as sources of predictor proteins for modeling drug sensitivity. Protein expression measured by mass spectrometry gave models with higher coefficients of determination than did reverse phase protein array (RPPA) predictor data. Further, cross validation of the elastic net models shows that, for many drugs, the prediction error is lower when the predictor data is from proteins, rather than mRNA expression measured on microarrays. Drugs that could be modeled effectively include PI3K inhibitors, Akt inhibitors, paclitaxel and docetaxel, rapamycin, everolimus and temsirolimus, gemcitabine and vinorelbine. Strikingly, this modeling approach with protein predictors often succeeds for drugs that are targeted agents, even when the nominal target is not in the dataset.",2015,Journal of proteomics & bioinformatics
Lasso for Instrumental Variable Selection: A Replication Study,"Summary 
Recently, Lasso methods have been applied to economic questions. In a seminal paper, Belloni et al. (Econometrica; 80(6): 2369â€“2429) make use of (post-)Lasso for instrumental variable selection in a setting where the number of instruments p is large or might even exceed the number of observations nâ€”a situation which is prevalent in many current applications. We replicate their simulation study with the statistical package R (R Development Core Team (2008)) and, moreover, analyze in more detail the importance of the choice of the penalization parameter, a crucial component in applications.

A between-Class Overlapping Filter-Based Method for transcriptome Data Analysis,"Feature selection algorithms play a crucial role in identifying and discovering important genes for cancer classification. Feature selection algorithms can be broadly categorized into two main groups: filter-based methods and wrapper-based methods. Filter-based methods have been quite popular in the literature due to their many advantages, including computational efficiency, simplistic architecture, and an intuitively simple means of discovering biological and clinical aspects. However, these methods have limitations, and the classification accuracy of the selected genes is less accurate. In this paper, we propose a set of univariate filter-based methods using a between-class overlapping criterion. The proposed techniques have been compared with many other univariate filter-based methods using an acute leukemia dataset. The following properties have been examined: classification accuracy of the selected individual genes and the gene subsets; redundancy check among selected genes using ridge regression and LASSO methods; similarity and sensitivity analyses; functional analysis; and, stability analysis. A comprehensive experiment shows promising results for our proposed techniques. The univariate filter based methods using between-class overlapping criterion are accurate and robust, have biological significance, and are computationally efficient and easy to implement. Therefore, they are well suited for biological and clinical discoveries.",2012,Journal of bioinformatics and computational biology

Additive risk survival model with microarray data,"BackgroundMicroarray techniques survey gene expressions on a global scale. Extensive biomedical studies have been designed to discover subsets of genes that are associated with survival risks for diseases such as lymphoma and construct predictive models using those selected genes. In this article, we investigate simultaneous estimation and gene selection with right censored survival data and high dimensional gene expression measurements.ResultsWe model the survival time using the additive risk model, which provides a useful alternative to the proportional hazards model and is adopted when the absolute effects, instead of the relative effects, of multiple predictors on the hazard function are of interest. A Lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) type estimate is proposed for simultaneous estimation and gene selection. Tuning parameter is selected using the V-fold cross validation. We propose Leave-One-Out cross validation based methods for evaluating the relative stability of individual genes and overall prediction significance.ConclusionWe analyze the MCL and DLBCL data using the proposed approach. A small number of probes represented on the microarrays are identified, most of which have sound biological implications in lymphoma development. The selected probes are relatively stable and the proposed approach has overall satisfactory prediction power.",2006,BMC Bioinformatics
Dataset for: Recurrence-associated gene signature optimizes recurrence free survival prediction of colorectal cancer,"High throughput gene expression profiling has showed great promise in providing insight into molecular mechanisms. Metastasis-related mRNAs may potentially enrich genes with the ability to predict cancer recurrenceï¼Œtherefore we attempted to build a recurrence-associated gene signature to improve prognostic prediction of colorectal cancer (CRC). We identified 2848 differentially expressed mRNAs by analyzing CRC tissues with or without metastasis. For the selection of prognostic genes, a LASSO Cox regression model was employed. Using this method, a 13-mRNA signature was identified and then validated in two independent Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) cohorts. This classifier could successfully discriminate the high-risk patients in discovery cohort (HR = 5.27, 95%CI= 2.30-12.08, P < 0.0001). Analysis in two independent cohorts yielded consistent results (GSE14333: HR=4.55, 95%CI=2.18 â€“ 9.508, P<0.0001) (GSE33113: HR=3.26, 95%CI=2.16 â€“ 9.16, P=0.0176). Further analysis revealed that the prognostic value of this signature was independent of tumor stage, postoperative chemotherapy and somatic mutation. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed that the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of this signature was 0.8861 and 0.8157 in the discovery and validation cohort, respectively. A nomogram was constructed for clinicians, which did well in the calibration plots. Furthermore, this 13-mRNA signature outperformed other known gene signatures, including oncotypeDX colon cancer assay. Single-sample gene-set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) revealed that a group of pathways related to drug resistance, cancer metastasis and stemness were significantly enriched in the high-risk patients. In conclusion, this 13-mRNA signature may be a useful tool for prognostic evaluation and will facilitate personalized management of CRC patients.",2017,
Sparse Regularization in Marketing and Economics,"Sparse alpha-norm regularization has many data-rich applications in Marketing and Economics. Alpha-norm, in contrast to lasso and ridge regularization, jumps to a sparse solution. This feature is attractive for ultra high-dimensional problems that occur in demand estimation and forecasting. The alpha-norm objective is nonconvex and requires coordinate descent and proximal operators to find the sparse solution. We study a typical marketing demand forecasting problem, grocery store sales for salty snacks, that has many dummy variables as controls. The key predictors of demand include price, equivalized volume, promotion, flavor, scent, and brand effects. By comparing with many commonly used machine learning methods, alpha-norm regularization achieves its goal of providing accurate out-of-sample estimates for the promotion lift effects. Finally, we conclude with directions for future research.",2018,arXiv: Machine Learning
An Algorithmic Approach to Linear Regression Bachelor Thesis 1,"We analyze a procedure how to build a high quality linear regression model. We start with an overview of the desirable properties, for example robustness and limited pairwise multicollinearity, of the linear regression model. We discuss the problem that the current approaches are not capable to find a linear regression model with the desirable properties. Therefore, our goal is to find a procedure that produces a linear regression model which achieves the desirable properties in a reasonable amount of time. We present an algorithmic approach in which the desirable properties are modeled as constraints and through penalties in the objective function of a Mixed Integer Quadratic Optimization (MIQO) model. The performance of the algorithm is shown on both real and synthetic data sets, and is compared with the widely used Lasso approach from Tibshirani (1996). Lastly, we extent the MIQO model with a heuristically chosen subset of interaction terms and compare the performance of the heuristic with Lasso on a synthetic data set.",2018,

Inference for Sparse Conditional Precision Matrices,"Given $n$ i.i.d. observations of a random vector $(X,Z)$, where $X$ is a high-dimensional vector and $Z$ is a low-dimensional index variable, we study the problem of estimating the conditional inverse covariance matrix $\Omega(z) = (E[(X-E[X \mid Z])(X-E[X \mid Z])^T \mid Z=z])^{-1}$ under the assumption that the set of non-zero elements is small and does not depend on the index variable. We develop a novel procedure that combines the ideas of the local constant smoothing and the group Lasso for estimating the conditional inverse covariance matrix. A proximal iterative smoothing algorithm is used to solve the corresponding convex optimization problems. We prove that our procedure recovers the conditional independence assumptions of the distribution $X \mid Z$ with high probability. This result is established by developing a uniform deviation bound for the high-dimensional conditional covariance matrix from its population counterpart, which may be of independent interest. Furthermore, we develop point-wise confidence intervals for individual elements of the conditional inverse covariance matrix. We perform extensive simulation studies, in which we demonstrate that our proposed procedure outperforms sensible competitors. We illustrate our proposal on a S&P 500 stock price data set.",2014,arXiv: Machine Learning
"Hybrid cavity-coupled plasmonic biosensors for low concentration , label-free and selective biomolecular detection","Simple optical techniques that can accurately and selectively identify organic and inorganic material in a reproducible manner are of paramount importance in biological sensing applications. In this work, we demonstrate that a nanoimprinted plasmonic pattern with locked-in dimensions supports sharp deterministic hybrid resonances when coupled with an optical cavity suitable for high sensitive surface detection. The surface sensing property of this hybrid system is quantified by precise atomic layer growth of aluminum oxide using the atomic layer deposition technique. The analyte specific sensing ability is demonstrated in the detection of two dissimilar analytes, inorganic amine-coated iron oxide nanoparticles and organic streptavidin protein. Femto to nanomolar detection limits were achieved with the proposed coupled plasmonic system based on the versatile and robust soft nanoimprinting technique, which promises practical low cost biosensors. c Â© 2016 Optical Society of America OCIS codes: (300.0300) Spectroscopy; (050.1950) Diffraction gratings; (280.1415) Biological sensing and sensors;(250.5403) Plasmonics; (310.6628) Subwavelength structures, nanostructures.

Moderated Network Models.,"Pairwise network models such as the Gaussian Graphical Model (GGM) are a powerful and intuitive way to analyze dependencies in multivariate data. A key assumption of the GGM is that each pairwise interaction is independent of the values of all other variables. However, in psychological research, this is often implausible. In this article, we extend the GGM by allowing each pairwise interaction between two variables to be moderated by (a subset of) all other variables in the model, and thereby introduce a Moderated Network Model (MNM). We show how to construct MNMs and propose an [Formula: see text]-regularized nodewise regression approach to estimate them. We provide performance results in a simulation study and show that MNMs outperform the split-sample based methods Network Comparison Test (NCT) and Fused Graphical Lasso (FGL) in detecting moderation effects. Finally, we provide a fully reproducible tutorial on how to estimate MNMs with the R-package mgm and discuss possible issues with model misspecification.",2019,Multivariate behavioral research
Extending the biosynthetic repertoire in ribosomal peptide assembly.,"Natural products are quite inspiring. To chemists, they inspire the development of new synthetic methods and the creation of ever more sensitive analytical techniques. Biologists, on the other hand, exploit natural products in the discovery of new molecular targets and drugs, as well as to learn more about the way cells or whole organisms communicate with each other. Natural products also motivate biochemists to explore new ways in which nature assembles complex organic molecules. Such products, in one form or another, have helped transform modern science. In this post-genomic era, the scientific field of natural product biosynthesis has witnessed a constant flow of fascinating discoveries outlining new biochemical transformations in secondary metabolism. Most recently, cyclic peptide natural products have served as the chemical inspiration for the discovery of new biosynthetic processes associated with the posttranslational modification of ribosomally derived bacterial peptides. This is especially true in the cyanobacteria, which are notorious for their uncanny ability to synthesize a wide variety of structurally diverse peptidyl products. Although they often employ nonribosomal peptide synthetase systems to capture a much wider array of substrates than the 20 proteinogenic amino acid building blocks that limit input into ribosomal peptides (RPs), two recent discoveries from the Schmidt and Hertweck/Dittmann research groups extend our understanding and appreciation of new enzymatic processes for diversifying ribosomally encoded peptides. The general trend in the biosynthesis of bacteriocin RPs, many of which possess potent antimicrobal or toxic properties, involves the synthesis of an N-terminal-extended prepeptide that undergoes various modes of posttranslational modification followed by proteolytic cleavage to liberate the active peptide. Well-known modifications involving the ligation of amino acid residues include the formation of disulfide linkages, lanthionine bridges such as in the lantibiotic nisin A, heteroaromatic rings such as in microcin B17, and macrolactam (amide) linkages such as in the lasso peptide microcin J25 (Scheme 1). A few years ago, two independent studies surprisingly revealed that the patellamide class of ascidian-derived cyclic peptides was in fact derived ribosomally from the cyanobacterial symbiont Prochloron didemni. These RPs, which include patellamide C (Scheme 1), were the first to combine structural features associated with the microcins: they harbored both heteroaromatic rings and were N to C cyclized. While the molecular basis for their assembly has been firmly established, and resulted in the combinatorial biosynthesis of structural libraries, biochemical features associated with the individual enzymatic transformations have not yet been clarified, although it has been speculated that the macrocylization reaction may proceed spontaneously. Recently, Schmidt and co-workers have extended their earlier observations and firmly established the identity of the â€œcyanobactinsâ€ as a major group of cyanobacterial RPs produced in symbionts and free-living organisms. Newly inducted into this group are a number of prenylated cyclic peptides such as the patellins and the antitumor agent trunkamide (Scheme 1). Bioinformatic analysis of the tru biosynthetic gene cluster did not reveal canonical prenyltransferases, thus suggesting the presence of an orthogonal enzymatic pathway to peptidyl prenylation in the cyanobactins. The plasticity of the genetic system was clearly established through the heterologous expression and recombination of the tru genes in Escherichia coli for the production of the natural products, which nicely sets the stage for the future assembly of prenylated RP libraries. The cyanobacterial toxins belonging to the microviridin family of tricyclic depsipeptides, such as microviridins B (Scheme 1) and J from Microcystis species, were recently reported by Hertweck, Dittmann, and co-workers to also be derived ribosomally. Three intramolecular w-ester and wamide linkages between side-chain residues distinguish these related natural products from other RPs. Inspection of the microviridin (mdn) biosynthetic loci from two producing strains revealed two genes (mdnB and mdnC) encoding ATPdependent carboxylate-amine/thiol ligases adjacent to the microviridin precursor gene (mdnA). The gene products MdnB and MdnC surprisingly belong to the ATP-grasp fold superfamily, which includes d-alanine:d-alanine ligase, glutathione synthetase, biotin carboxylase, and succinate-CoA [*] Prof. Dr. B.

"[Cardiopathies in children hospitalized at the University hospital Souro Sanou, Bobo-Dioulasso: echocardiographic and therapeutic aspects].","Children's heart diseases in Africa represent a public health problem that is difficult to cope with due to young population density, low socioeconomic status and lack of suitable technical platforms. This study aims to highlight the echocardiographic and therapeutic aspects of cardiopathies in children hospitalized at the pediatric department of the University Hospital Souro Sanou, Bobo-Dioulasso. We conducted a descriptive cross-sectional study over the period January 2013-December 2014 (24 months). It was based on a literature review of echocardiography reports performed on children under 15 years of age in the echocardiography laboratory of CHUSS and of medical records of their therapeutic follow-up. During the study period, 184 echocardiographic examinations were performed and allowed identification of 93 cases of children with heart disease (50.50% of cases). Among them, 71% (66/93) of cases with congenital cardiopathies were distinguished and 29% (27/93) of acquired cardiopathies. The most common congenital heart diseases were: IVC (27.2%), IAC (10.6%), AVC (7.5%), F4T (9.1%), CAT (6%), related forms ( 15%). Acquired heart diseases were dominated by rheumatic valve diseases (48%), hypokinetic dilated cardiomyopathy (33.3%) and pericardial tamponade (18.5%). Surgery was recommended in 53.7% (50/93) of cases, of whom 86% (43/50) with congenital heart diseases and 14% (7/50) with acquired heart diseases. 21% (9/43) of patients with congenital heart diseases underwent cardiac surgery. No acquired heart disease requiring surgery was surgically treated. Cardiopathies in children are frequent in Bobo-Dioulasso. Multidisciplinary strategies associated with resource optimization should improve the management of these cardiopathies.",2016,The Pan African medical journal
Intra-urban and peri-urban differences in cattle farming systems of,"a b s t r a c t Little is known about the classification of urban and peri-urban cattle farming systems in West Africa. To contribute to filling this knowledge gap, we conducted a questionnaire-based survey in 137 and 133 cattle enterprises located, respectively, within and beyond the municipal boundaries of the city of Bobo Dioulasso in Burkina Faso. Categorical principal component and two-step cluster analysis techniques were used to group the different farms. The farmer's engagement in crop production, the area of cultivated land, his experience in cattle farming, the orientation of the cattle enterprises towards fattening or milk production and the feeding mode (zero-grazing, grazing only or grazing plus supplementation), among others, were relevant differentiating factors. Overall nine distinct clusters reflecting different farming systems in the intra-urban and peri-urban areas were identified. Farm types in the intra-urban area were mainly oriented towards meat production and included intensive landless cattle fattening (n = 30; 21.9%), semi-intensive grassland-based cattle farming (n = 40; 29.2%), extensive cattle farming (n = 20, 14.6%), semi-intensive maize-cattle farming (n = 37, 27.0%) and intensive maize-cattle farming (n = 10, 7.3%). In contrast, farms in the peri-urban area were mostly oriented towards milk production and classified as semi-intensive pastoral (n = 11; 8.3%), semi-sedentary pastoral (n = 38; 28.6%), medium-scale agro- pastoral maize-dairy farming (n = 40, 30.1%), and small-scale agro-pastoral dairy-maize farming (n = 44; 33.1%). The intensive landless fattening enterprises seem to be most promising for the future exploitation of the growing demand of urban customers for beef, whereas small dairy herds integrated or not with crop production appear to be the most adapted to the continuously changing peri-urban environment.",2015,
"Form, function, and the flight of the pterosaur.","A. W. A. Kellner and D. A. Campos (â€œThe function of the cranial crest and jaws of a unique pterosaur from the Early Cretaceous of Brazil,â€ Reports, 19 July, p. [389][1]) suggest that the huge cranial crest of a newly discovered pterosaur might have had multiple functions, including mating display and thermoregulation, but they say it might have interfered with flight.

The authors compare the pterosaur with a modern bird less than one-fifth its size, speculating that the pterosaur might have caught fish by flying low over water with its lower jaw partially submerged.

The relatively massive lower jaw of the analogous modern bird, drawn in the authors' Fig. 3, suggests that the pterosaur could not have maintained flight against water resistance with its entire lower jaw submerged, but must have skimmed with the distal third or so, where the greatest lateral compression is shown to occur.

Not discussed by the authors is that the pterosaur probably needed its crest to balance its long jaws, the attitude of the head changing somewhat depending on locomotion on land, flying speed, or submergence of the lower jaw while flying over water.

A crest inflatable with blood and possibly variable in air resistance (like a hand-held fan) would have helped the pterosaur adjust the long-term attitude of its head, reducing the need for heavy, powerful neck muscles, at the cost of requiring a little more forward thrust while skimming. The force of air against an extended crest would balance the force of water on the jaw, keeping the head from being rotated toward the water.

Far from interfering with flight, an inflatable crest might have made longer flights possible. The spermaceti reservoir in the head of the sperm whale is supposed to have a similar function, allowing the whale to use blood flow to adjust the temperature and thus the buoyancy provided by the spermaceti.

# Response {#article-title-2}

WORKING WITH EXTINCT ORGANISMS IS always a challenge, particularly when it comes to the interpretation of the function of previously unknown structures. In our report, we described a skull and lower jaw of a new pterosaur ( Thalassodromeus sethi ) from Early Cretaceous deposits of Brazil, which bears a gigantic bony crest never before recorded in any animal (fossil or recent). We listed several possible functions of this oversized structure, focusing primarily on its effect in signaling (e.g., species recognition) and on its possible use to control body temperature. Despite noting that it had to have an aerodynamic effect (due to its large size), we did not discuss this function in detail, as correctly pointed out by Williams. He further suggests that in Thalassodromeus , this crest might have been inflatable and acted to balance the force of water on the jaw in a similar function of the spermaceti reservoir in the head of the sperm whale that is supposed to adjust buoyancy. We reject the â€œinflatable crest hypothesisâ€ on the basis of the reasons discussed below.

The oversized cranial structure in Thalassodromeus is made up of two thin layers of bone connected on the sagittal plane by a well-developed system of trabeculae (see the [figure][2]). It is difficult to imagine that such a laterally compressed structure could be substantially â€œinflatedâ€ (even by soft tissue present on the lateral side) to have a strong aerodynamic effect that could not have been achieved otherwise (e.g., simple lateral movement of the head). The analogy with a supposed buoyancy adjustment of the spermaceti organ in sperm whales does not make much sense in a flying animal that had other perhaps more effective mechanisms to â€œfloatâ€ in the air (e.g., wings). Furthermore, the spermaceti is mostly regarded as having other functions ranging from aggression (discarded for this pterosaur because of the fragility of the crest) to a sonar [e.g., ([1][3])]. On the basis of the large occipital region and muscle scars, Thalassodromeus did have strong neck muscles that (in conjunction with the flying apparatus) kept the head from being rotated toward the water during fishing.

Perpendicular (coronal) section of the upper portion of the cranial crest of the pterosaur Thalassodromeus sethi. 

The gray area on the left-hand side is the matrix (m) that originally involves the bone (removed from the right side); the white substance is calcium carbonate (c) that occasionally forms geodes with the growth of calcite crystals (g). The actual bone (b) is very thin, forming the external part of the crest (two arrows) and the thin trabeculae inside the crest (double arrow). This configuration demonstrates the hollow nature of the crest. Scale bar, 5 mm.

The main problem regarding the aerodynamic influence of the crest is empirically establishing the range of those effects considering all variables (e.g., angles and wind speed). The idea of this crest being used as a forward rudder, for example, is very tempting, and there seems to be little doubt that any lateral movement of the head would allow this animal to change direction during flight. Even during fishing, fast changes of the trajectory might have increased the capacity of Thalassodromeus to catch a preyâ€”particularly when skimming the water surface.

To properly study the aerodynamics of Thalassodromeus , however, there is a need for information from different sources starting with the fossils but including notions of biomechanics (e.g., muscle power and stress capacity of different biological tissues) and flight mechanics. Only a project with such an interdisciplinary approach, to which we would like to contribute, could empirically establish the limitations and effects of such an oversized cranial structure, including any effect that an extended crest might have had as a counterbalance to the forces of the water on the jaws, also suggested by Williams.

Performance Analysis of Updating-QR Supported OLS Against Stochastic Gradient Descent,"Regression model is a well-studied method for the prediction of real-valued data. Depending on the structure of the data involved, different approaches have been adopted for estimating the parameters which includes the Linear Equation solver, Gradient Descent, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and the like. The performance of each of them varies based on the data size and computation involved. Many methods have been introduced to improve their performance like QR factorization in least squares problem. Our focus is on the analysis of performance of gradient descent and QR based ordinary least squares for estimating and updating the parameters under varying data size. We have considered both tall/skinny as well as short/fat matrices. We have implemented Block Householders method of QR factorization in Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) platform using Graphics Processor Unit (GPU) GTX 645 with the initial set of data. New upcoming data is updated directly to the existing Q and R factors rather than applying QR factorization from the scratch. This updating-QR platform is then utilized for performing regression analysis. This will support the regression analysis process on-the-fly. The results are then compared against the gradient descent implemented. The results prove that parallel-QR method for regression analysis achieves speed-up of up to 22x compared with the gradient descent method when the attribute size is larger than the sample size and speed-up of up to 2x when the sample size is larger than the attribute size. Our implementation results also prove that the updating-QR method achieves speed-up approaching 2x over the gradient descent method for large datasets when the sample size is less than the attribute size.",2016,
A Model-based approach to transcription regulatory network reconstruction from time-course gene expression data,"Time-course gene expression profiling provides valuable data on dynamic behavior of cellular responses to external stimulation. Investigation of transcription factors (TFs) that regulate co-expressed genes in a dynamic process can reveal insights on the underlying molecular mechanisms. As the ChIP-seq technology is only suitable for a fraction of TFs in mammalian organisms, the computational identification of relevant TFs remains to be critical. We propose a regression-based model to infer the functional binding sites of TFs from time-course gene expression profiles. Our approach incorporates an association strength for each potential TF and target gene pair based on computational analysis of binding sites in promoter sequences of co-expressed genes. Our model further uses the Lasso-penalized technique to search for the most informative TF-target pairs. The application of our method to a gene expression study on E2-induced apoptosis in a variant of MCF-7 cells revealed that the findings are biologically meaningful.",2014,2014 36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society
No Reference Quality Assessment for Multiply-Distorted Images Based on an Improved Bag-of-Words Model,"Multiple distortion assessment is a big challenge in image quality assessment (IQA). In this letter, a no reference IQA model for multiply-distorted images is proposed. The features, which are sensitive to each distortion type even in the presence of other distortions, are first selected from three kinds of NSS features. An improved Bag-of-Words (BoW) model is then applied to encode the selected features. Lastly, a simple yet effective linear combination is used to map the image features to the quality score. The combination weights are obtained through lasso regression. A series of experiments show that the feature selection strategy and the improved BoW model are effective in improving the accuracy of quality prediction for multiple distortion IQA. Compared with other algorithms, the proposed method delivers the best result for multiple distortion IQA.",2015,IEEE Signal Processing Letters
Ethylene Production by Slices of Green Banana Fruit and Potato Tuber Tissue During The Development of Induced Respiration,"It is well known that injury and infection by disease organisms may stimulate ethylene production by plant tissues (Williamson 1950; Burg 1962; McGlasson and Pratt 1964). The increased ethylene production which results from injury in fruit tissues may hasten the onset of a respiratory climacteric. This response, which has been observed in slices cut from three-quarter-grown cantaloupe fruit, may herald the commencement of physiological changes leading to natural ripening (McGlasson and Pratt 1964). However, in underground storage tissues, stimulated ethylene production may be concerned with the mechanisms of wound healing (Stahmann, Clare, and Woodbury 1966; Imaseki, Uchiyama, and Uritani 1968). The phenomenon of induced respiration in tissue slices of bulky underground storage organs has been known for many years (Laties 1967) and more recently it has been found to occur in sections or slices of other plant parts (ap Rees 1966). Palmer and McGlasson (1969) observed a similar rise in slices of green banana fruit which they considered to be a form of ""induced"" respiration.",1969,Australian Journal of Biological Sciences
Model selection procedures for high dimensional genomic,"Many complex diseases are thought to be caused by multiple genetic variants. Recent advances in genotyping technology allowed investigators of a complex disease to obtain data for a massive number of candidate genetic variants. Typically each candidate variant is tested individually for an association with the disease. We approach the problem as one of model selection for high dimensional data. We propose a method whereby penalised maximum likelihood estimation provides a reasonably sized set of variants for inclusion in our model. We then perform stepwise regression on this set of variants to arrive at our model. Penalised maximum likelihood estimation is performed with both the lasso and a more recently developed method known as the hyperlasso, with smoothing parameters chosen by cross-validation. The hyperlasso has a penalty function that favours sparser solutions but with less shrinkage of those variables that are included in the model, when compared to the lasso; however, this comes at extra computational cost. We apply the above method to a large genomic data set from a previously published mice obesity study and use resample model averaging to assess model performance.

LASSO approximation and application to image super-resolution with CUDA acceleration,"Sparse learning based methods are effective for image restoration applications since they make use of texture priors learned by pre-trained over-complete dictionaries. However, sparse learning based methods are extremely slow due to complexity of sparse decomposition and a large number of image patches to process. In this paper, we introduce a fast approximation for LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) and apply the approach to single image super-resolution with CUDA acceleration. Our approach utilizes linear combinations of pre-computed sparse codes of standard orthogonal bases to estimate the sparse code of input signal. Error analysis is performed to find the feasible conditions of our approach and upper-bound of the estimation error. The simplicity of our approach makes it easy to be implemented on GPU. As for super-resolution application, we apply our approach to improve one of the best super-resolution methods by Yang et. al. The super-resolution results are comparable with that of the state-of-the-art methods while the speed can be increased to 620%.",2017,"2017 2nd International Conference on Image, Vision and Computing (ICIVC)"
Gender based survival prediction models for heart failure patients: A case study in Pakistan,"OBJECTIVES
The objective of this study was to build and assess the performance of survival prediction models using the gender-specific informative risk factors for patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction.


METHODS
A lasso approach was used to decide the informative predictors for building semi-parametric proportional hazards Cox model. Separate models were built for all patients [N = 299], male patients [Nmale = 194 (64.88%)], and female patients [Nfemale = 105 (35.12%)], to observe the risk factors associated with the individual's risk of death. The likelihood- ratio test was used to test the goodness of fit of the selected model, and the C-index was used to assess the predictive performance of the selected model(s) with respect to the overall model with all observed risk factors.


RESULTS
The survival prediction model for females is notably different from that for males. For males, smoking, diabetes, and anaemia, whereas for females, ejection fraction, sodium, and platelets count are non-informative with zero regression coefficients. The goodness of fit of the selected models with respect to the general model with all observed risk factors is tested using the likelihood-ratio test. The results are in favor of the selected models with p-values 0.51,0.61, and 0.70 for all patients, male patients, and female patients, respectively. The same values of C-index for the full model and the selected models for overall data, for males, and for females (0.72, 0.73, and 0.77 for overall data, male data, and female data, respectively) indicate that the selected models are as good as the corresponding overall models regarding their predictive performance.


CONCLUSION
There is a substantial difference in the survival prediction models for heart failure (HF) of male and female patients in this study. More studies are needed in Pakistan for confirming this striking male-female difference regarding the potential risk factors to predict survival with heart failure.",2019,PLoS ONE
Near-ideal behavior of a modified Elastic Net algorithm,In this paper it is shown that a modification of the Elastic Net algorithm (MEN) exhibits near ideal behavior in the following sense: Suppose the input to the algorithm is a vector of known sparsity index but unknown locations for the nonzero components. Then the output error of the algorithm is bounded by a universal constant times the error achieved by an oracle that knows not just the sparsity index but also the locations of the nonzero components. This result generalizes an earlier result of CandeÌ€s and Plan on the near ideal behavior of the LASSO algorithm.,2013,52nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control
Joan of Art: In Defence of Subjectivity,"This thesis examines the relationship between Adorno's 'shudder' and conceptual art, in the interest of conceiving of an art form resistant to societal and ontological 'objectification', as embodied by scientific pursuit, capitalist endeavour, and recent philosophical innovation (particularly in the work of Ray Brassier's Nihil Unbound, and Quentin Meillassoux's After Finitude). This art form, it will be argued, must necessarily be completely conceptual, devoid of any object which might become sundered to these objectifying forces. Just such a form, might be appealed to in order that the subject can feign an escape from absolute objectivity at the hands of the nihilising influence of science. Can the concept of freedom as an artistic declaration help the human to evade reification, in a way that can co-exist with accepted scientific findings; namely the clear base materiality of the 'subject', and the finitude of subjectivity, as signalled by Brassier and the absolute contingency of Quentin Meillassoux? 
 
Examining the implications of Duchamp's 'anything can be art' admixed with Beuys' 'We are all artists,' the study draws, in its latter third, on examinations of Adorno's 'shudder' made in the first chapter, in order to conceive of a means by which the subject may overturn its objectification via the declaration of its own subjectivity even in face of the falsity of this premise. Where, for Adorno, the 'shudder' is felt in face of the artwork, as the subject realises it base objectivity (as a result of the 'truth' which the artwork, as perpetual deceiver in a an untrue world, imparts), this study calls for the shudder, which frees the subject from objectivity, to be auto-designated by the subject, upon itself, for lack of an artwork capable of otherwise invoking it in a thoroughly reified world.",2012,
On the Linear Convergence of the Approximate Proximal Splitting Method for Non-smooth Convex Optimization,"Consider the problem of minimizing the sum of two convex functions, one being smooth and the other non-smooth. In this paper, we introduce a general class of approximate proximal splitting (APS) methods for solving such minimization problems. Methods in the APS class include many well-known algorithms such as the proximal splitting method, the block coordinate descent method (BCD), and the approximate gradient projection methods for smooth convex optimization. We establish the linear convergence of APS methods under a local error bound assumption. Since the latter is known to hold for compressive sensing and sparse group LASSO problems, our analysis implies the linear convergence of the BCD method for these problems without strong convexity assumption.",2014,Journal of the Operations Research Society of China
Theoretical density distribution of plasma streaming around a cylinder,"Abstract The distribution of plasma density around a metallic cylinder in a collisionfree plasma is determined by the system of Vlassov equations and the Poisson equation. The plasma may have a streaming velocity perpendicular to the cylinder axis producing a wake behind the cylinder. In the region outside a thin double layer at the cylinder surface the problem allows some simplification. Then numerical solutions become possible-even if the streaming velocity is low. Some numerical solutions are presented. A magnetic field produces an asymmetric shape of the wake, if the gyration radius of the ion becomes comparable to the cylinder radius.",1975,Planetary and Space Science
Sparse Regression Models of Pain Perception,"Discovering brain mechanisms underlying pain perception remains a challenging neuroscientific problem with important practical applications, such as developing better treatments for chronic pain. Herein, we focus on statistical analysis of functional MRI (fMRI) data associated with pain stimuli. While the traditional mass-univariate GLM [8] analysis of pain-related brain activation can miss potentially informative voxel interaction patterns, our approach relies instead on multivariate predictive modeling methods such as sparse regression (LASSO [17] and, more generally, Elastic Net (EN) [18]) that can learn accurate predictive models of pain and simultaneously discover brain activity patterns (relatively small subsets of voxels) allowing for such predictions. Moreover, we investigate the effect of temporal (time-lagged) information, often ignored in traditional fMRI studies, on the predictive accuracy and on the selection of brain areas relevant to pain perception. We demonstrate that (1) Elastic Net regression can be highly predictive of pain perception, by far outperforming ordinary leastsquares (OLS) linear regression; (2) temporal information is very important for pain perception modeling and can significantly increase the prediction accuracy; (3) moreover, regression models that incorporate temporal information discover brain activation patterns undetected by non-temporal models.",2010,
Functional models in genome-wide selection,"The development of sequencing technologies has enabled the discovery of markers that are abundantly distributed over the whole genome. Knowledge about the marker locations in reference genomes provides further insights in the search for causal regions and the prediction of genomic values. The present study proposes a Bayesian functional approach for incorporating the marker locations into genomic analysis using stochastic methods to search causal regions and predict genotypic values. For this, three scenarios were analyzed: F2 population with 300 individuals and three different heritability levels (0.2, 0.5, and 0.8), along with 12,150 SNP markers that were distributed through ten linkage groups; Fâˆž populations with 320 individuals and three different heritability levels (0.2, 0.5, and 0.8), along with 10,020 SNP markers that were distributed through ten linkage groups; and data related to Eucalyptus spp. to measure the model performance in a real LD setting, with 611 individuals whose phenotypes were simulated from QTLs distributed through a panel of 36,812 SNPs with known positions. The performance of the proposed method was compared with those of other genome selection models, namely, RR-BLUP, Bayes B and Bayesian Lasso. The Bayesian functional model presented higher or similar predictive ability when compared with those classical regressions methods in simulated and real scenarios on different LD structures. In general, the Bayesian functional model also achieved higher computational efficiency, using 12 SNPs per MCMC round. The model was efficient in the identification of causal regions and showed high flexibility of analysis, as it is easily adaptable to any genomic selection model.",2019,PLoS ONE
"Rulers and rainmakers in precolonial South Pare, Tanzania: Exchange and ritual experts in political centralization","This article applies Bourdieu's notion of symbolic capital to an analysis of political processes in the small chiefdoms of South Pare Mountain in northeastern Tanzania between 1700 and 1900. Regional exchange of cattle and exotic goods interacted with other social processes to create political change in societies with incipient political centralization. Political legitimization was based on the symbolic capital of ritual preeminence which demanded investment of economic resources. Regional exchange and the development of long-distance ivory and slave trade on the East African coast increased the cost of symbolic capital and exacerbated competition for political power. (East Africa, South Pare, history, political economy, chiefdoms, exchange, politics, ritual) The emergence of political centralization and the dynamics of chiefdoms have recently become central issues in archaeology (Earle 1991; Johnson and Earle 1987; Upham 1990; Hayden 1995). Although that research builds upon earlier theoretical work by cultural anthropologists and is based on ethnographic material, the topic has declined in salience in the field of ethnology. Many archaeologists are also now of the opinion that the utility of ethnographic comparisons has reached its limit, and that research should focus instead on long-term archaeological sequences of chiefdom developments (e.g., Earle 1991). However, in a recent article, Roscoe (1993; cf. Thomas 1996) calls for renewed attention from cultural anthropology to the topic and for collaboration between the two fields in order to develop models based on current social theory (e.g., Giddens 1986; Bourdieu 1990). This article takes up that challenge by applying Bourdieu's notion of symbolic capital to an analysis of political processes in the small chiefdoms of the South Pare Mountain in northeastern Tanzania between 1700 and 1900.(1) During this period, South Pare societies were part of an exchange system involving food, ivory, and slaves. These items were bartered for prestige goods in the form of livestock from pastoralists, and exotic valuables such as cloth, beads, and metals from coastal traders involved in the Indian Ocean trade. This article takes a diachronic perspective to demonstrate how the exchange of prestige goods interacted with other social processes to create political change in societies with incipient centralization. The analysis leads to a hypothesis about how political centralization may have emerged in these chiefdoms. Several authors have observed a relationship between the density of exchange networks and availability of prestige goods on the one hand, and the degree of political centralization on the other (Ekholm 1977; Kipp and Schortman 1989). For Melanesia and Polynesia, Brunton (1975), Friedman (1981), and Persson (1983) show that where valuables necessary for social payments cannot be controlled by any group, political organization is highly competitive and acephalous; while in regions where sources of valuables are few and exchange networks circumscribed, chiefly hierarchies occur. However, the development of incipient political centralization from acephalous social organization involves something more than the control of prestige goods. Cross-culturally, chiefly status and institutions were based on legitimacy, often of a ritual nature. The ritual power of chiefs in Africa is well known. The structural-functionalists saw it as an integrative force for maintenance of the social system (Fortes and Evans-Pritchard 1940). The Marxists view ritual power as legitimizing ideology; a smoke screen for exploitation by elites (Meillassoux 1981:86f.). Both approaches pay little attention to the fact that ideology is costly. Emerging elites cannot simply claim ritual power and expect to be believed. Ideology is rooted in prevailing cosmologies and social norms which may not lend themselves to easy centralization. But Bourdieu's (1990) notion of symbolic capital, while admittedly vague, may better reflect the role of ritual in the politics of chiefdoms and acephalous societies (cf. â€¦",1998,Ethnology

The Local Nature of List Colorings for Graphs of High Girth,"We consider list coloring problems for graphs $\mathcal{G}$ ofgirth larger than clogÎ”-1n, where nand Î”â‰¥ 3 are,respectively, the order and the maximum degree of $\mathcal{G}$,and cis a suitable constant. First, we determine that theedge and total list chromatic numbers of these graphs are$\chi'_l({\mathcal{G}}) = \Delta$ and $\chi''_l({\mathcal{G}}) =\Delta + 1$. This proves that the general conjectures ofBollobas and Harris (1985), Behzad and Vizing (1969) andJuvan, Mohar and `krekovski (1998) hold for this particular classof graphs. 
 
Moreover, our proofs exhibit a certain degree of ""locality"",which we exploit to obtain an efficient distributed algorithm ableto compute both kinds of optimal list colorings. 
 
Also, using an argument similar to one of Erdos, we showthat our algorithm can compute k-list vertex colorings ofgraphs having girth larger than clogk-1n.",2008,
Trough concentration over 12.1 mg/L is a major risk factor of vancomycin-related nephrotoxicity in patients with therapeutic drug monitoring.,"BACKGROUND
High doses of vancomycin increase the risk of nephrotoxicity, but the quantitative relationship between vancomycin exposure and nephrotoxicity is still controversial. This study evaluated the relationship between vancomycin trough concentration and nephrotoxicity, and risk factors for nephrotoxicity in patients undergoing therapeutic drug monitoring.


METHODS
A total of 1269 cases from patients who underwent therapeutic drug monitoring were collected from 2006 to 2010. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between trough concentration and the incidence of nephrotoxicity. Logistic regression using the generalized Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (lasso) method was used to evaluate possible risk factors for nephrotoxicity. The data were divided into high/low-concentration groups by the cutoff value obtained from the receiver operating characteristic curve, and additional logistic regression using the generalized lasso method was performed for each group.


RESULTS
The cutoff value of the vancomycin trough concentration was 12.1 mg/L. Patients with high concentrations (>12.1 mg/L) were more likely to develop nephrotoxicity (odds ratio = 16.0, 95% confidence interval, 8.2-31.1). The vancomycin trough concentration was the only significant risk factor for nephrotoxicity identified using the generalized lasso (P < 0.001). In contrast, no factor was associated with nephrotoxicity in the low-concentration group.


CONCLUSIONS
Vancomycin trough concentrations over 12.1 mg/L were associated with an increased risk of nephrotoxicity. This is lower than the known threshold. Trough vancomycin concentration over the threshold was the only risk factor of nephrotoxicity among demographic factors, dosing regimen, and other clinical conditions in this study. It is suggested that vancomycin trough concentrations greater than 12.1 mg/L require close monitoring for nephrotoxicity.",2014,Therapeutic drug monitoring
Do psychological factors or radiographic severity play a role in the age of onset in symptomatic developmental dysplasia of hip and femoroacetabular impingement syndrome?,"BackgroundAge of onset in symptomatic developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) and femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS) varies. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether psychological factors, radiographic, and clinical variables were related to age of onset of hip pain in DDH and FAIS.MethodsWe collected demographic, clinical, and radiographic data on 56 DDH and 84 FAIS patients. Each was diagnosed based on radiographic findings and clinical history. Age of onset was operationalized by subtracting patient reported duration of symptoms from patient age at presentation. Pain catastrophizing (PCS) and depression were assessed with the pain catastrophizing scale and hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS), respectively. Multiple linear regression modeling, with Lasso variable selection, was implemented.ResultsPain catastrophizing, anxiety, and depression were not significantly related to age of DDH onset (p-values >â€‰0.27) or age of FAIS onset (p-values >â€‰0.29). LASSO-penalized linear regression revealed alpha Dunn angle, Tonnis grade, prior hip surgery, WOMAC pain score, and iHOT total score were associated with age of onset in FAIS (Adjusted R2â€‰=â€‰0.3099). Lateral center edge angle (LCEA), alpha frog angle, Tonnis grade, SF12 physical functioning, and body mass index (BMI) were associated with age of DDH onset (Adjusted R2â€‰=â€‰0.3578).ConclusionsPsychological factors, as measured by PCS and HADS, were not associated with age of onset in DDH or FAIS. Functional impairment as measured by WOMAC pain and impaired active lifestyle as measured by iHOT were found to affect age of FAIS onset. For DDH, impaired physical functioning and increasing BMI were found to be associated with age of onset. Severity of the disease, as measured radiographically by LCEA and alpha Dunn angle, was also found to be associated with earlier age of onset in DDH and FAIS, respectively. A patientâ€™s radiographic severity may have more of a relationship to the onset of pain than physiologic factors.",2019,BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders
Random weighting to approximate posterior inference in LASSO regression,"We consider a general-purpose approximation approach to Bayesian inference in which repeated optimization of a randomized objective function provides surrogate samples from the joint posterior distribution. In the context of LASSO regression, we repeatedly assign independently-drawn standard-exponential random weights to terms in the objective function, and optimize to obtain the surrogate samples. We establish the asymptotic properties of this method under different regularization parameters $\lambda_n$. In particular, if $\lambda_n = o(\sqrt{n})$, then the random-weighting (weighted bootstrap) samples are equivalent (up to the first order) to the Bayesian posterior samples. If $\lambda_n = \mathcal{O} \left( n^c \right)$ for some $1/2 < c < 1$, then these samples achieve conditional model selection consistency. We also establish the asymptotic properties of the random-weighting method when weights are drawn from other distributions, and also if weights are assigned to the LASSO penalty terms.",2020,arXiv: Methodology
"Thalassotalea marina sp. nov., isolated from a marine recirculating aquaculture system, reclassification of Thalassomonas eurytherma as Thalassotalea eurytherma comb. nov. and emended description of the genus Thalassotalea.","A Gram-stain-negative, facultatively anaerobic bacterium, strain QBLM2T, was isolated from rearing water of a marine recirculating aquaculture system in Tianjin, China. Its taxonomic position was investigated through a polyphasic approach. Cells of strain QBLM2T were non-spore-forming rods, motile by means of a single polar flagellum. Positive for oxidase and catalase. Growth occurred at 15-40â€‰Â°C (optimum 30â€‰Â°C), at pHâ€‰6.5-10.5 (optimum pHâ€‰7.5-8.5) and in the presence of 0-5.0â€‰% (w/v) NaCl (optimum 3â€‰%). Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain QBLM2T formed a distinct lineage within the genus Thalassotalea and exhibited sequence similarities of 94.5-96.3â€‰% to members of the genus Thalassotalea. The predominant fatty acids (>10â€‰%) were C17â€‰:â€‰1Ï‰8c and summed feature 3 (C16â€‰:â€‰1Ï‰7c and/or C16â€‰:â€‰1Ï‰6c). The major polar lipids were phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine. Ubiquinone 8 (Q-8) was the major ubiquinone. The DNA G+C content was 37.1â€Šmol%. Based on the data above, strain QBLM2T is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Thalassotalea, for which the name Thalassotalea marina sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is QBLM2T (â€‰=â€‰CGMCC 1.12814Tâ€‰=â€‰KCTC 42731T). Phylogenetic analyses indicated that Thalassomonas eurytherma Za6a-12T fell within the genus Thalassotalea, so it is reclassified as Thalassotalea eurytherma comb. nov. and the description of the genus Thalassotalea is emended.",2015,International journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology
[Clinical profile of cryptosporidiosis in a pediatric hospital environment in Burkina Faso].,"Data concerning Cryptosporidium parvum infection in Black Africa are highly fragmentary. A 12-month study was carried out on 1392 stool specimens from children under 36 months of age with (n = 756) or without diarrhea (n = 629) in the Pediatric Department of Bobo Dioulasso Hospital in Burkina Faso. In 558 children HIV blood tests were also performed. The phenicated fuchsin technique was used to identify Cryptosporidia oocysts. Results were positive in 72 of the 1392 stool specimens tested (5.2%) and in 59 of the 756 stool samples from children with diarrhea (7.8%). Oocysts were not detected in any child under the age of 6 months and the highest incidence of infection was between 6 and 23 months. Detection of oocysts during this year long study was significantly higher from April to June, which corresponds to the beginning of the rainy season in Burkina Faso. Occurrence of diarrhea was not significantly correlated with parasite density. Presence of oocysts was correlated with malnutrition (p < 0.01) and rotavirus infection (p < 0.05). Of the 558 children who underwent HIV testing, only one was positive. In contrast the incidence of HIV infections in the overall population tested was 7%. This study indicates that cryptosporidiasis is a major factor in development of diarrhea and dehydration in the pediatric hospital setting of Burkina Faso. Two other notable findings are that occurrence of cryptosporidiosis is closely linked to hygiene in the population but is not significantly correlated with HIV infection in the pediatric setting in Africa.",1998,Medecine tropicale : revue du Corps de sante colonial
Ovarian Papillary Cystadenocarcinoma in Sub Saharan Africa: A Case Report,"Introduction: Ovarian cancer is the fifth most common cancer of women; it accounts for 3.8% of all neoplasms. It concerns women over 45 years old and its revelation is late. Ovarian papillary cystadenocarcinoma is the most frequent histological form in 75% of cases. Its prognosis is bleak because of its late diagnosis. The purpose of this observation is to discuss its diagnostic and therapeutic approach in a context of limited resources. 
Patient and methods: It is a case study realized at Bobo-Dioulassoâ€™s Teaching Hospital Center (Burkina Faso). 
Results: We report here the case of an ovarian papillary cystadenocarcinoma in a 28 year old patient, revealed by a pelvic tumor, without alteration of the general state. 
Conclusion: The malignant ovarian tumor is possible before 30 years; abdominopelvic computed tomography should supplement abdominopelvic ultrasound in the event of diagnosis of ovarian tumor to better define the nature of lesions and their degree of invasion and allow better planning of treatment.",2017,
Microstructural and metabolic changes in the brains of concussed athletes,"Concussions had long been considered an injury of little to no consequence. However, the forced retirement of several high profile athletes due to the impact of having suffered multiple concussions has pushed the issue to the forefront of scientific and sports culture alike. Despite the growing public awareness and the ever-expanding scientific understanding of concussions there is still much that remains unknown about these injuries. Indeed, understanding how an injury can have such profound effects, though mostly transient, without any apparent physical consequence continues to confound how concussions are conceptualized in research. Neuroimaging techniques have helped answer many of the questions surrounding the physical consequences of concussions on the brain as well as increasing the general understanding of the pathophysiology of concussions. While basic structural imaging techniques such as CT scans and MRI are unable to detect any structural changes in the vast majority of cases (Ellemberg, et al., 2009; Johnston, et al., 2001), other more precise and sensitive techniques have been able to successfully detect changes in the concussed brain. Functional MRI studies have further established a strong relationship between functional alterations and post-concussion symptoms (Chen, et al., 2007; Chen, et al., 2004; Chen, et al., 2008; Fazio, et al., 2007). Electrophysiological measures such as ERP (Gaetz, et al., 2000; Gaetz & Weinberg, 2000; Theriault, et al., 2009; Theriault, et al., 2010) and TMS (De Beaumont, Brisson, et al., 2007; De Beaumont, Lassonde, et al., 2007; De Beaumont, et al., 2009) have consistently demonstrated alterations in concussed",2011,
New algorithm for constructing area-based index with geographical heterogeneities and variable selection: An application to gastric cancer screening,"To optimally allocate health resources, policy planners require an indicator reflecting the inequality. Currently, health inequalities are frequently measured by area-based indices. However, methodologies for constructing the indices have been hampered by two difficulties: 1) incorporating the geographical relationship into the model and 2) selecting appropriate variables from the high-dimensional census data. Here, we constructed a new area-based health coverage index using the geographical information and a variable selection procedure with the example of gastric cancer. We also characterized the geographical distribution of health inequality in Japan. To construct the index, we proposed a methodology of a geographically weighted logistic lasso model. We adopted a geographical kernel and selected the optimal bandwidth and the regularization parameters by a two-stage algorithm. Sensitivity was checked by correlation to several cancer mortalities/screening rates. Lastly, we mapped the current distribution of health inequality in Japan and detected unique predictors at sampled locations. The interquartile range of the index was 0.0001 to 0.354 (mean: 0.178, SD: 0.109). The selections from 91 candidate variables in Japanese census data showed regional heterogeneities (median number of selected variables: 29). Our index was more correlated to cancer mortalities/screening rates than previous index and revealed several geographical clusters with unique predictors.",2016,Scientific Reports
Contextual Correlates of Physical Activity among Older Adults: A Neighborhood Environment-Wide Association Study (NE-WAS).,"Background: Few older adults achieve recommended physical activity levels. We conducted a ""neighborhood environment-wide association study (NE-WAS)"" of neighborhood influences on physical activity among older adults, analogous, in a genetic context, to a genome-wide association study.Methods: Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) and sociodemographic data were collected via telephone survey of 3,497 residents of New York City aged 65 to 75 years. Using Geographic Information Systems, we created 337 variables describing each participant's residential neighborhood's built, social, and economic context. We used survey-weighted regression models adjusting for individual-level covariates to test for associations between each neighborhood variable and (i) total PASE score, (ii) gardening activity, (iii) walking, and (iv) housework (as a negative control). We also applied two ""Big Data"" analytic techniques, LASSO regression, and Random Forests, to algorithmically select neighborhood variables predictive of these four physical activity measures.Results: Of all 337 measures, proportion of residents living in extreme poverty was most strongly associated with total physical activity [-0.85; (95% confidence interval, -1.14 to -0.56) PASE units per 1% increase in proportion of residents living with household incomes less than half the federal poverty line]. Only neighborhood socioeconomic status and disorder measures were associated with total activity and gardening, whereas a broader range of measures was associated with walking. As expected, no neighborhood meaZsures were associated with housework after accounting for multiple comparisons.Conclusions: This systematic approach revealed patterns in the domains of neighborhood measures associated with physical activity.Impact: The NE-WAS approach appears to be a promising exploratory technique.

The Image of the Loyal African During World War II and its Postwar Use by the French Communist Party,"From Marx's writing on the ""Irish question,"" through Lenin's Imperialism, on to Meillassoux's recent work with labor migration, the impact of imperialist economic development upon class struggles within the metropolitan nations has occupied analysts of capitalist imperialism. But cultural imperialism and its relationship with metropolitan class struggles may deserve similar attention. The conceptions of African society imposed by European administrators and scholars upon colonial Africa may have played a vital role in obscuring African resistance to colonial domination and class development in Africa from even the most progressive elements of the metropolitan proletariat. The following account describes the image of African political attitudes and actions during World War II created by contemporary French propaganda and, subsequently, French historiography, and discusses the use of these images by the French Communist party in the postwar period.1",1980,Canadian Journal of African Studies
Aerobic cometabolism of tetrabromobisphenol A by marine bacterial consortia,"The coastal environments worldwide are subjected to increasing TBBPA contamination, but current knowledge on aerobic biodegradability of this compound by marine microbes is lacking. The aerobic removal of TBBPA using marine consortia under eight different cometabolic conditions was investigated here. Results showed that the composition and diversity of the TBBPA-degrading consortia had diverged after 120-day incubation. Pseudoalteromonas, Alteromonas, Glaciecola, Thalassomonas, and Limnobacter were the dominant genera in enrichment cultures. Furthermore, a combination of beef extract- and peptone-enriched marine consortia exhibited higher TBBPA removal efficiency (approximately 60%) than the other substrate amendments. Additionally, Alteromonas macleodii strain GCW was isolated from a culture of TBBPA-degrading consortium. This strain exhibited about 90% of degradation efficiency toward TBBPA (10 mg Lâˆ’1) after 10 days of incubation under aerobic cometabolic conditions. The intermediates in the degradation of TBBPA by A. macleodii strain GCW were analyzed and the degradation pathways were proposed, involving Î²-scission, debromination, and nitration routes.",2019,Environmental Science and Pollution Research

Sampling Lasso quantile regression for large-scale data,"ABSTRACT With the quantile regression methods successfully applied in various applications, we often need to tackle with the big dataset with thousands of variables and millions of observations. In this article, we focus on the variable selection aspect of penalized quantile regression, and propose a new method Sampling Lasso Quantile Regression (SLQR), which allows selecting a small amount but informative data for fitting quantile regression models. Different from the ordinary regularization methods, this SLQR method performs a sampling technique to reduce the number of observations before applying Lasso. Through numerical simulation studies and real application in Greenhouse Gas Observing Network, we illustrate the efficacy of the SLQR method. The numerical results show that the SLQR method is able to achieve a high-precision quantile regression on large-scale data for both prediction and interpretation.",2018,Communications in Statistics - Simulation and Computation
Comparison of communities of ectomycorrhizal fungi in old-growth and mature stands of Douglas-fir at two sites on southern Vancouver Island,"An old-growth and a mature stand, each of fire origin and similar in drainage, slope, and exposure, were selected at each of two sites. Soil cores were collected in spring and fall for 2 years in each stand. Ectomycorrhizae were separated into types based on detailed examination of morphology and anatomy. All root tips were separated and counted. Sixty-nine morphological types were distinguished. Nineteen accounted for >1% of the 17 500 root tips examined, and 14 types were found in â™¢5% of the 120 soil cores. Only three types were found in â™¢20% of the cores. Total richness was approximately 100 fungi. Nine codominant mycosymbionts each colonized 2.8n24% of all tips and together colonized 67% of all tips. Cenococcum geophilum Fr. was the most abundant, followed by a Rhizopogon vinicolor Fr.-like species, an unidentified Piloderma-like species, Lactarius rubrilacteus Hesler & Smith, Piloderma fallax (Libert) Stalpers, and four unidentified species.

SCAD-Ridge penalized likelihood estimators for ultra-high dimensional models,"Extraction of as much information as possible from huge data is a burning issue in the modern statistics due to more variables as compared to observations therefore penalization has been employed to resolve that kind of issues. Many achievements have already been made by such penalization techniques. Due to the large number of variables in many research areas declare it a high dimensional problem and with this the sample correlation becomes very large. In this paper, we studied the maximum likelihood estimation of variable selection under smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) and Ridge penalties with ultra-high dimension settings to solve this problem. We established the oracle property of the proposed model under some conditions by following the theoretical method of Kown and Kim (2012) [19].

Quasi-pseudolikelihood in Markov network structure learning,"Kumpula Campus Library Probabilistic graphical models are a versatile tool for doing statistical inference with complex models. The main impediment for their use, especially with more elaborate models, is the heavy computational cost incurred. The development of approximations that enable the use of graphical models in various tasks while requiring less computational resources is therefore an important area of research. In this thesis, we test one such recently proposed family of approximations, called quasi-pseudolikelihood (QPL). Graphical models come in two main variants: directed models and undirected models, of which the latter are also called Markov networks or Markov random fields. Here we focus solely on the undirected case with continuous valued variables. The specific inference task the QPL approximations target is model structure learning, i.e. learning the model dependence structure from data. In the theoretical part of the thesis, we define the basic concepts that underpin the use of graphical models and derive the general QPL approximation. As a novel contribution, we show that one member of the QPL approximation family is not consistent in the general case: asymptotically, for this QPL version, there exists a case where the learned dependence structure does not converge to the true model structure. In the empirical part of the thesis, we test two members of the QPL family on simulated datasets. We generate datasets from Ising models and Sherrington-Kirkpatrick models and try to learn them using QPL approximations. As a reference method, we use the well-established Graphical lasso (Glasso). Based on our results, the tested QPL approximations work well with relatively sparse dependence structures, while the more densely connected models, especially with weaker interaction strengths, present challenges that call for further research.

Estimation and Selection via Absolute Penalized Convex Minimization And Its Multistage Adaptive Applications,"The â„“1-penalized method, or the Lasso, has emerged as an important tool for the analysis of large data sets. Many important results have been obtained for the Lasso in linear regression which have led to a deeper understanding of high-dimensional statistical problems. In this article, we consider a class of weighted â„“1-penalized estimators for convex loss functions of a general form, including the generalized linear models. We study the estimation, prediction, selection and sparsity properties of the weighted â„“1-penalized estimator in sparse, high-dimensional settings where the number of predictors p can be much larger than the sample size n. Adaptive Lasso is considered as a special case. A multistage method is developed to approximate concave regularized estimation by applying an adaptive Lasso recursively. We provide prediction and estimation oracle inequalities for single- and multi-stage estimators, a general selection consistency theorem, and an upper bound for the dimension of the Lasso estimator. Important models including the linear regression, logistic regression and log-linear models are used throughout to illustrate the applications of the general results.",2012,Journal of machine learning research : JMLR
Lag weighted lasso for time series model,"The adaptive lasso can consistently identify the true model in regression model. However, the adaptive lasso cannot account for lag effects, which are essential for a time series model. Consequently, the adaptive lasso can not reflect certain properties of a time series model. To improve the forecast accuracy of a time series model, we propose a lag weighted lasso. The lag weighted lasso imposes different penalties on each coefficient based on weights that reflect not only the coefficients size but also the lag effects. Simulation studies and a real example show that the proposed method is superior to both the lasso and the adaptive lasso in forecast accuracy.",2013,Computational Statistics

Predicting quantitative traits with regression models for dense molecular markers and pedigree.,"The availability of genomewide dense markers brings opportunities and challenges to breeding programs. An important question concerns the ways in which dense markers and pedigrees, together with phenotypic records, should be used to arrive at predictions of genetic values for complex traits. If a large number of markers are included in a regression model, marker-specific shrinkage of regression coefficients may be needed. For this reason, the Bayesian least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) (BL) appears to be an interesting approach for fitting marker effects in a regression model. This article adapts the BL to arrive at a regression model where markers, pedigrees, and covariates other than markers are considered jointly. Connections between BL and other marker-based regression models are discussed, and the sensitivity of BL with respect to the choice of prior distributions assigned to key parameters is evaluated using simulation. The proposed model was fitted to two data sets from wheat and mouse populations, and evaluated using cross-validation methods. Results indicate that inclusion of markers in the regression further improved the predictive ability of models. An R program that implements the proposed model is freely available.",2009,Genetics
Classification of longitudinal data through a semiparametric mixed-effects model based on lasso-type estimators.,"We propose a classification method for longitudinal data. The Bayes classifier is classically used to determine a classification rule where the underlying density in each class needs to be well modeled and estimated. This work is motivated by a real dataset of hormone levels measured at the early stages of pregnancy that can be used to predict normal versus abnormal pregnancy outcomes. The proposed model, which is a semiparametric linear mixed-effects model (SLMM), is a particular case of the semiparametric nonlinear mixed-effects class of models (SNMM) in which finite dimensional (fixed effects and variance components) and infinite dimensional (an unknown function) parameters have to be estimated. In SNMM's maximum likelihood estimation is performed iteratively alternating parametric and nonparametric procedures. However, if one can make the assumption that the random effects and the unknown function interact in a linear way, more efficient estimation methods can be used. Our contribution is the proposal of a unified estimation procedure based on a penalized EM-type algorithm. The Expectation and Maximization steps are explicit. In this latter step, the unknown function is estimated in a nonparametric fashion using a lasso-type procedure. A simulation study and an application on real data are performed.",2015,Biometrics
Herbicide Combinations for Weed Control in Skyline Honeylocust 1,"Pre-emergent fall applications of alachlor (Lasso) and oxadiazon (Ronstar) singly or in combination with linuron (Lorox) or simazine (Princep) exhibited in some cases excellent weed control in excess of 9 months in a Skyline honeylocust planting. Alachlor when applied at the 6.0 Ib AIA (active ingredient per acre) rate controlled annual grass weeds 10 months after application. Oxadiazon exhibited excellent control of both annual grasses and broadleaf weeds at all rates except when used singly at 3.0 Ib AIA. In addition, some control of bigroot morning glory (Ipomea pandurata) was observed with oxadiazon. Sequential applications of glysophate (Roundup) controlled weeds in the nursery situation with no phytotoxicity to the skyline honeylocust trees. would more efficiently control annual grass and broadleaf weeds, including perennials. Time of application of the herbicide treatments was designed so that fall treatments could extend the weed control period beyond the heavy spring work period. This resulting herbicide program should reduce labor and operating costs, increase production of quality plant material in a shorter period of time and negate the effects of wet weather and seasonal workloads on both the application of herbicides and on the control of weed growth. Control of weed populations is an essential management practice in the commercial production of shade trees. Increased demand for quality plants, reduced production schedules, and rising costs, make the use of herbicides imperative. The control of weeds in the shade tree nursery is complicated by several problems. First, adverse weather together with heavy spring and fall workloads can leave little opportunity for weed control practices. Secondly, shade trees are generally grown in the same location for 3-8 years, which makes it difficult to cultivate and impossible to fumigate. In addition, no single herbicide has yet been developed that will control all troublesome weeds without injury to some nursery crops. For the above reasons a research project was initiated to develop an herbicide program which Materials and Methods These experiments were conducted at the Cole Nursery Co., Inc., of Circleville, Ohio. Each individual experiment consisted of 6 treatments and a control with 3 replications. Plot design was completely randomized and each plot was 9' x 10' with 6-4 year old Gleditsia triacanthos inermis 'Skyline' trees per plot. All herbicides were applied with a CO2 constant pressure sprayer calibrated to deliver the herbicides in the equivalent of 36 gallons of water per acre. Both alachlor 4 EC and oxadiazon 2 EC were applied September 13, 1974 on clean cultivated soil in order to evaluate the control of winter and spring weed growth. The glysophate studies were initiated on May 20, 1975 and repeat applications were subsequently applied at 3 and 5 week intervals.

Data on weed control, weed species present and observation of any injury to the nursery stock were evaluated monthly during the growing season. Treatment means when significant were separated using Duncan's multiple range test. All herbicides were applied either alone or in combination with another herbicide to lengthen and increase overall weed control. Some of the prominent weed species present included Pennsylvania smartweed (Polygonum pennsylvanicum), common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia), common lambsquarter (Chenopodium album), galinsoga (Galinsoga parviflora), rough pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus), henbit (Lamium amplexicaule), yellow rocket (Barbarea vulgarls), wild morning glory {Convolvulus arvensis), chickweed (Stellaria media), bigroot morning glory (Ipomoea pandurata), shepard's purse (Capsella bursa-pastoris), daisy fleabane (Erigeron strigosus), mare's tail (Erigeron canadensis), large crabgrass (Digitaria sanguinalis), yellow foxtail (Setaria lutescens), and barnyard grass (Echinochloa crusgalli). Results Alachlor (Lasso) â€” Alachlor is a preemergent herbicide that controls annual grasses (3) and when applied singly it has given safe, effective weed control in a wide range of ornamentals. Previous studies have indicated that alachlor may be combined with linuron or simazine to increase its weed spectrum (1,2). All rates and combinations of alachlor gave satisfactory broadleaf weed control through June 4, 1975, 9 months after the initial application when compared to the nontreated control plots. Alachlor at 6.0 Ib AIA (AIA = active ingredient per acre) alone or in combination gave better annual grass weed control than alachlor at 3.0 Ib AIA alone or in combination with simazine at 1.0 Ib AIA (Table 1). The combination of alachlor at 6.0 Ib AIA + simazine at 1.0 Ib AIA gave significantly better broadleaf weed control at the June 4, 1975 evaluation period and continued to be the better treatment in later evaluation periods. The broadleaf weeds controlled by alachlor included chickweed, yellow rocket, daisy fleabane, mare's tail, henbit and shepard's purse, however by the late July evaluation period weed control was becoming ineffective with increasing populations of ragweed, lambsquarter, yellow foxtail, galinsoga, and annual morning glory.

Radiomics analysis of apparent diffusion coefficient in cervical cancer: A preliminary study on histological grade evaluation,"BACKGROUND
The role of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)-based radiomics features in evaluating histopathological grade of cervical cancer is unresolved.


PURPOSE
To determine if there is a difference between radiomics features derived from center-slice 2D versus whole-tumor volumetric 3D for ADC measurements in patients with cervical cancer regarding tumor histopathological grade, and systematically assess the impact of the b value on radiomics analysis in ADC quantifications.


STUDY TYPE
Prospective.


SUBJECTS
In all, 160 patients with histopathologically confirmed squamous cell carcinoma of uterine cervix.


FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE
Conventional and diffusion-weighted MR images (b valuesâ€‰=â€‰0, 800, 1000 s/mm2 ) were acquired on a 3.0T MR scanner.


ASSESSMENT
Regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn manually along the margin of tumor on each slice, and then the center slice of the tumor was selected with naked eyes in the course of whole-tumor segmentation. A total of 624 radiomics features were derived from T2 -weighted images and ADC maps. We randomly selected 50 cases and did the reproducibility analysis.


STATISTICAL TESTS
Parameters were compared using Wilcoxon signed rank test, Bland-Altman analysis, t-test, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression with crossvalidation.


RESULTS
In all, 95 radiomics features were insensitive to ROI variation among T2 images, ADC map of b800, and ADC map of b1000 (P > 0.0002). There was a significant statistical difference between the performances of 2D center-slice and 3D whole-tumor radiomics models in both ADC feature sets of b800 and b1000 (P < 0.0001, P < 0.0001). Compared with ADC features of b800 (0.3758â€‰Â±â€‰0.0118), the model of b1000 ADC features appeared to be slightly lower in overall misclassification error (0.3642â€‰Â±â€‰0.0162) (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.0076).


DATA CONCLUSION
Several radiomics features extracted from T2 images and ADC maps were highly reproducible. Whole-tumor volumetric 3D radiomics analysis had a better performance than using the 2D center-slice of tumor in stratifying the histological grade of cervical cancer. A b value of 1000 s/mm2 is suggested as the optimal parameter in pelvic DWI scans.

357-OR: Early Pregnancy Trace Element Mixtures and Gestational Glucose Levels Late in the 2nd Trimester,"Background: A number of essential trace elements are involved in glucose metabolism, but the associations between these elements and glucose levels among pregnant women are unclear. Furthermore, little is known about the joint association of these trace elements. Methods: We used data from 1857 women enrolled in the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Fetal Growth Study, for whom trace element status (Zn, Se, Cu, Mo) was determined using plasma collected during the 1 st trimester. Non-fasting glucose levels were measured during the GDM screening test. Three approaches were used to assess the joint effects of these trace elements on glucose levels. First, all four trace elements were included in a multivariable linear model and adaptive lasso was performed for model selection. Second, generalized additive models (GAMs) with model selection were fitted to allow non-linear associations. Lastly, a novel method, Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR) was used to model the dose-response relationships of the trace element mixture in a non-parametric fashion. Results: In the multivariable linear model, we observed significant associations of glucose levels with plasma Cu (2.4 mg/dL increase per 1 SD increase on the log scale; 95% CI: 1.1, 3.7) and plasma Mo (-1.4 mg/dL decrease per 1 SD increase on the log scale; 95% CI: -2.6, -0.1). The GAM showed suggestive evidence of non-linear positive interaction between Zn and Cu in plasma (p-value = 0.052). Similar results were observed using the BKMR approach. Conclusion: Employing different statistical methods to study the effect of early pregnancy trace element mixtures on glucose levels, we found consistent evidences of hyperglycemic effect of Cu and hypoglycemic effect of Mo, as well as potential synergism between Zn and Cu. Future work is needed to better understand the joint effects of these elements in the context of the increasingly insulin-resistant state of pregnancy. Disclosure Y. Zheng: None. C. Zhang: None. P.L.

Regularization parameter selection for low rank matrix recovery,"Low rank matrix recovery is the focus of many applications, but it is a NP-hard problem. A popular way to deal with this problem is to solve its convex relaxation, the nuclear norm regularized minimization problem (NRM), which includes LASSO as a special case. There are some regularization parameter selection results for LASSO in vector case, such as screening rules, which improve the efficiency of the algorithms. However, there are no corresponding parameter selection results for NRM in matrix case. In this paper, we build up a novel rule to choose the regularization parameter for NRM under the help of duality theory. This rule claims that the regularization parameter can be easily chosen by feasible points of NRM and its dual problem, when the rank of the desired solution is no more than a given constant. In particular, we apply this idea to NRM with least square and Huber functions, and establish the easily calculated formula of regularization parameters. Finally, we report numerical results on some signal shapes, which state that our proposed rule shrinks the interval of the regularization parameter efficiently.",2019,arXiv: Optimization and Control
Improving Deep Neural Network Sparsity through Decorrelation Regularization,"Modern deep learning models usually suffer high complexity in model size and computation when transplanted to resource constrained platforms. To this end, many works are dedicated to compressing deep neural networks. Adding group LASSO regularization is one of the most effective model compression methods since it generates structured sparse networks. We investigate the deep neural networks trained by group LASSO constraint and observe that even with strong sparsity regularization imposed, there still exists substantial filter correlation among the convolution filters, which is undesired for a compact neural network. We propose to suppress such correlation with a new kind of constraint called decorrelation regularization, which explicitly forces the network to learn a set of less correlated filters. The experiments on CIFAR10/100 and ILSVRC2012 datasets show that when combined our decorrelation regularization with group LASSO, the correlation between filters could be effectively weakened, which increases the sparsity of the resulting model and leads to better compressing performance.",2018,

Mining transcript features related to translation in Arabidopsis using LASSO and random forest,"Translation is an important process for all living organisms. During translation, messenger RNA is rewritten into protein. Multiple control mechanisms determine how much protein is generated during translation. In particular, several regulatory elements located on mRNA transcripts are known to affect translation. In this study, a genome-wide analysis was performed to mine features related to translation in the genome of Arabidopsis thaliana. We used ribosome footprinting data to measure translation and constructed a predictive model using LASSO and random forest to select features that likely affect translation. We identified multiple transcript features and measured their influence on translation in different transcript regions. We found that features related to different translation stages may have a different impact on translation; often, features relevant to the elongation step were playing a stronger role. Interestingly, we found that the contribution of features may be different for transcripts belonging to different functional groups, suggesting that transcripts might employ different mechanisms for the regulation of translation.",2015,2015 IEEE 5th International Conference on Computational Advances in Bio and Medical Sciences (ICCABS)
