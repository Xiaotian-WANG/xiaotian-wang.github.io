Variable selection for high-dimensional generalized varying-coefficient models,"In this paper, we consider the problem of variable selection for high- dimensional generalized varying-coefficient models and propose a polynomial-spline based procedure that simultaneously eliminates irrelevant predictors and estimates the nonzero coefficients. In a ""large p, small n"" setting, we demonstrate the conver- gence rates of the estimator under suitable regularity assumptions. In particular, we show the adaptive group lasso estimator can correctly select important vari- ables with probability approaching one and the convergence rates for the nonzero coefficients are the same as the oracle estimator (the estimator when the impor- tant variables are known before carrying out statistical analysis). To automatically choose the regularization parameters, we use the extended Bayesian information cri- terion (eBIC) that effectively controls the number of false positives. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to examine the finite sample performance of the proposed procedures.",2012,Statistica Sinica
Normalization of multicenter CT radiomics by a generative adversarial network method.,"PURPOSE
To reduce the variability of radiomics features caused by computed tomography (CT) imaging protocols through using a generative adversarial network (GAN) method.


MATERIAL AND METHODS
In this study, we defined a set of images acquired with a certain imaging protocol as a domain, and a total of 4 domains (A, B, C, and T [target]) from 3 different scanners were included. In dataset#1, 60 patinets for each domain were collected. Datasets#2 and #3 included 40 slices of spleen for each of the domains. In dataset#4, the slices of 3 colorectal cancer groups (n = 28, 38, and 32) were separately retrieved from 3 different scanners, and each group contained short-term and long-term survivors. 77 features were extracted for evaluation by comparing features distributions. First, we trained the GAN model on dataset#1 to learn how to normalize images from domains A, B, and C to T. Next, by comparing feature distributions between normalized images of the different domains, we identified the appropriate model and assessed it , in dataset #2 and dataset#3, respectively. Finally, to investigate whether our proposed method could facilitate multicenter radiomics analysis, we built the lasso classifier to distinguish short-term from long-term survivors based on a certain group in dataset#4, and validate it in another two groups, which formed a cross-validation between groups in dataset#4.


RESULTS
After normalization, the percentage of aligned features between domains A vs T, B vs T, and C vs T increased from 10.4 %, 18.2%, and 50.1% to 93.5%, 89.6%, and 77.9%, respectively. In the cross-validation results, average improvement of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve achieved 11% (3%-32%).


CONCLUSION
Our proposed GAN-based normalization method could reduce the variability of radiomics features caused by different CT imaging protocols and facilitate multicenter radiomics analysis.",2020,Physics in medicine and biology
Rischi glaciali in Valle d'Aosta. Monitoraggio e ricerca applicata,"I fenomeni di origine glaciale rappresentano una fonte di rischio importante nelle aree di montagna e nelle Alpi in particolare. Il rischio deriva dall'interazione tra le dinamiche glaciali, molto attive ed in rapida evoluzione anche - ma non solo - in relazione al cambiamento climatico, e la presenza antropica, in forte espansione nelle aree alpine nell'ultimo secolo. I principali rischi di origine glaciale derivano dal crollo di seracchi, dal collasso di ghiacciai temperati e dal rilascio improvviso di acqua accumulata nei ghiacciai stessi. Il territorio valdostano, per le sue caratteristiche, e particolarmente soggetto a tali rischi. Per questa ragione l'amministrazione regionale, tramite la Fondazione montagna sicura, ha attuato un piano di monitoraggio specifico per il rischio glaciale. Il piano si articola in diverse azioni, sia a livello dell'intero territorio sia per il monitoraggio di casi specifici",2013,

Sparsity-based approaches for damage detection in plates,"Abstract The data deluge in Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) and the need for automated online damage detection systems necessitates a move away from traditional model-based approaches. To that end, we propose sparsity-based algorithms for damage detection in plates. Instead of high-fidelity models, our proposed algorithms use dictionaries, consisting of response signals acquired directly from the system of interest, as the key feature to both detect and localize damages. We address the damage detection problem both when the damage is located on or off a grid of possible damage coordinates defined by the dictionary. This gives rise to two classes of problems, namely, on the grid and off the grid problems. In our sparsity-based on the grid damage detection (SDD-ON) platform, we solve a LASSO regression problem, where, the unknown vector is a pointer for existence of damage at the various locations defined on the grid used for dictionary construction. In our proposed off the grid damage detection (SDD-OFF) platform, we use a penalized regression algorithm to extend the dictionary of measured damage signals to points off-the-grid by linear interpolation. We evaluate the performance of both SDD frameworks, in detecting damages on plates, using finite element simulations as well as laboratory experiments involving a pitch-catch setup using a single actuator-sensor pair. Our results suggest that the proposed algorithms perform damage detection in plates efficiently. We obtain area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of 0.997 and 0.8314 for SDD-ON and SDD-OFF, respectively.",2019,Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing
Combining Value-at-Risk forecasts using penalized quantile regressions,"Penalized quantile regressions are proposed for the combination of Value-at-Risk forecasts. The primary reason for regularization of the quantile regression estimator with the elastic net, lasso and ridge penalties is multicollinearity among the standalone forecasts, which results in poor forecast performance of the non-regularized estimator due to unstable combination weights. This new approach is applied to combining the Value-at-Risk forecasts of a wide range of frequently used risk models for stocks comprising the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index. Within a thorough comparison analysis, the penalized quantile regressions perform better in terms of backtesting and tick losses than the standalone models and several competing forecast combination approaches. This is particularly evident during the global financial crisis of 2007â€“2008.",2017,Econometrics and Statistics
A learning-based CT prostate segmentation method via joint transductive feature selection and regression,"In1 recent years, there has been a great interest in prostate segmentation, which is a important and challenging task for CT image guided radiotherapy. In this paper, a learning-based segmentation method via joint transductive feature selection and transductive regression is presented, which incorporates the physician's simple manual specification (only taking a few seconds), to aid accurate segmentation, especially for the case with large irregular prostate motion. More specifically, for the current treatment image, experienced physician is first allowed to manually assign the labels for a small subset of prostate and non-prostate voxels, especially in the first and last slices of the prostate regions. Then, the proposed method follows the two step: in prostate-likelihood estimation step, two novel algorithms: tLasso and wLapRLS, will be sequentially employed for transductive feature selection and transductive regression, respectively, aiming to generate the prostate-likelihood map. In multi-atlases based label fusion step, the final segmentation result will be obtained according to the corresponding prostate-likelihood map and the previous images of the same patient. The proposed method has been substantially evaluated on a real prostate CT dataset including 24 patients with 330 CT images, and compared with several state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-arts in terms of higher Dice ratio, higher true positive fraction, and lower centroid distances. Also, the results demonstrate that simple manual specification can help improve the segmentation performance, which is clinically feasible in real practice.",2016,Neurocomputing

Variable Selection in the Chlamydia Pneumoniae Lung Infection Study,"In this study, the data based on nucleic acid amplication tech- niques (Polymerase chain reaction) consisting of 23 dierent transcript vari- ables which are involved to investigate genetic mechanism regulating chlamy- dial infection disease by measuring two dierent outcomes of muring C. pneumonia lung infection (disease expressed as lung weight increase and C. pneumonia load in the lung), have been analyzed. A model with fewer reduced transcript variables of interests at early infection stage has been obtained by using some of the traditional (stepwise regression, partial least squares regression (PLS)) and modern variable selection methods (least ab- solute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), forward stagewise regres- sion and least angle regression (LARS)). Through these variable selection methods, the variables of interest are selected to investigate the genetic mechanisms that determine the outcomes of chlamydial lung infection. The transcript variables Tim3, GATA3, Lacf, Arg2 (X4, X5, X8 and X13) are being detected as the main variables of interest to study the C. pneumonia disease (lung weight increase) or C. pneumonia lung load outcomes. Models including these key variables may provide possible answers to the problem of molecular mechanisms of chlamydial pathogenesis.",2013,
Comparative Effect of Various Herbicides on the Control of Weeds in Groundnut (Arachis Hypogeae L.),"An experiment to study the comparative effect of five herbicides 2, 4-D, Lasso, Vernam. Tenoran and Tok E-25 for the control of weeds in groundnut and their effect on pod yield was conducted for two Kharif seasons 1970â€“71 on variety M - 145 under irrigated conditions, at the Punjab Agricultural University Farm, Ludhiana. There was a marked reduction in the dry weight of weeds from 1354 kg/ha in unweeded control to only 180 kg/ha with â€˜Lassoâ€™ application. The pre-emergence spray of Lasso at the rate of 5 kg/ha also brought a significant improvement in plant characters. The plant height reduced from 16.60 cm to 13.55 cm, the number of secondary branches per plant increased from 8.58 to 11.33 (13%), and weight of mature pods per plant enhanced from 6.85 to 9 56 g.

A53T alpha-synuclein induces mitophagy through MAM-induced fission and reduced impairment of LC3B to promote alpha-synuclein degradation,"A53T alpha-synuclein induces mitophagy through MAM-induced fission and reduced impairment of LC3B to promote alpha-synuclein degradation Kayla M. Humphries Advisor: University of Guelph, 2017 Dr. Scott Ryan Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction and aggregated Î±-synuclein (Î±-syn). Some cases of PD are caused by mutations in Î±syn, resulting in an increased propensity for aggregation. To investigate the link between mitochondrial dysfunction and the Î±-syn mutation A53T, human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), each consisting of an A53T line and a wildtype or corrected control line, were differentiated into dopaminergic human neurons (hNs). Transmission electron microscopy demonstrated that A53T cells had elongated mitochondrialassociated membranes (MAMs) at early timepoints, which were shortened to normal lengths by day 60 of differentiation, concurrent with mitochondrial fragmentation. Golgi dilation and vacuolar area were increased in A53T hNs, indicative of an increased autophagic load. Immunofluorescence showed that aggregated Î±-syn has a greater colocalization with lysosomes in A53T hNs, suggesting lysosomes degrade, or attempt to degrade, aggregated Î±-syn. This degradation could occur alongside mitophagy, as knockdown of the apoptotic protein beclin1 decreased cell survival in the A53T line, indicating mitophagy is protective. Further, in vitro experiments demonstrate that A53T Î±-syn has a reduced ability to impair binding of the mitophagy-initiating protein LC3B to mitochondria, suggesting that A53T cells would be more vulnerable to mitophagy. Potential therapies should focus on preventing MAM-induced fission and restoring the ability of A53T cells to impair LC3B-mediated mitophagy.",2017,
Dynamics of Petroleum-degrading Bacterial Community with Biodegradation of Petroleum Contamination in Seawater,"The dynamics of petroleom-degrading bacterial community resulting from biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbon contamination in seawater is analyzed by DGGE(denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) and constructing of 16S rDNA clone library.The concentrations of oil-degrading microbes and the rate of oil degradation are also examined.It is found that the concentrations of oil-degrading microbes are at lower level in the natural seawater near Ningbo port,but the addition of petroleum hydrocarbon to seawater result in a rapid increase of the concentrations and they may reach the peak value on the 14th day,with the number of 2.4 Ã— 107 cells.mL-1.In this period the bacteria is most diverse in its richness.The petroleum-degrading bacterial community structure change throughout the process.On the 7th day,Alcanivorax and Thalassospira become the dominant bacteria of the community;and on the 14th day,the dominant bacteria diversity is increased with addition of Pseudomonas;and the 21st day sees the critical role that cinetobacter and Parvibaculum play in this period.The degradation of oil reaches the highest rate in the latter period of degradation process(171(mg.d-1)Â·L-1),with the degradation of petroleum hydrocarbon being 28.74% after 21 days into the process.",2009,Journal of Ningbo University
Egalitarian LASSO for Combining Economic Forecasts,"Despite the clear success of forecast combination in many economic environments, several important issues remain incompletely resolved. The issues relate to selection of the set of forecasts to combine, and whether some form of additional regularization (e.g., shrinkage) is desirable. Against this background, and also considering the frequently-found superiority of simple-average combinations, we propose LASSO-based procedures that select and shrink toward equal combining weights. We then provide an empirical assessment of the performance of our â€œegalitarian LASSOâ€ procedures. The results indicate that simple averages are highly competitive, and that although out-of-sample RMSE improvements on simple averages are possible in principle using egailitarian LASSO methods, they are hard to achieve without endowing the forecaster with information not available ex ante, due to the intrinsic difficulty of small-sample cross validation of LASSO tuning parameters. We therefore propose alternative direct combination procedures, most notably â€œbest averageâ€ combination, motivated by the structure of egalitarian LASSO and the lessons learned, which do not require choice of a tuning parameter. Intriguingly, they turn out to outperform simple averages.

Identification of a metabolic gene panel to predict the prognosis of myelodysplastic syndrome.,"Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is clonal disease featured by ineffective haematopoiesis and potential progression into acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). At present, the risk stratification and prognosis of MDS need to be further optimized. A prognostic model was constructed by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis for MDS patients based on the identified metabolic gene panel in training cohort, followed by external validation in an independent cohort. The patients with lower risk had better prognosis than patients with higher risk. The constructed model was verified as an independent prognostic factor for MDS patients with hazard ratios of 3.721 (1.814-7.630) and 2.047 (1.013-4.138) in the training cohort and validation cohort, respectively. The AUC of 3-year overall survival was 0.846 and 0.743 in the training cohort and validation cohort, respectively. The high-risk score was significantly related to other clinical prognostic characteristics, including higher bone marrow blast cells and lower absolute neutrophil count. Moreover, gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) showed several significantly enriched pathways, with potential indication of the pathogenesis. In this study, we identified a novel stable metabolic panel, which might not only reveal the dysregulated metabolic microenvironment, but can be used to predict the prognosis of MDS.",2020,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine

Estimator Augmentation with Applications in High-Dimensional Group Inference,"We generalize the method of estimator augmentation (Zhou 2014) to the block Lasso, defined via the block-$(1,\alpha)$ norm, which includes both the group Lasso $(\alpha=2)$ and the Lasso $(\alpha=1)$ as special cases. By augmenting a block Lasso estimator $\hat{\beta}$ with the subgradient $S$ of the block norm evaluated at $\hat{\beta}$, we derive a closed-form density for the joint distribution of $(\hat{\beta},S)$ under a high-dimensional setting. This allows us to draw from an estimated sampling distribution of $\hat{\beta}$, or more generally any function of $(\hat{\beta},S)$, by Monte Carlo algorithms and make inference about a group of parameters. We demonstrate the application of estimator augmentation in group inference with the group Lasso and a de-biased group Lasso constructed as a function of $(\hat{\beta},S)$. Our numerical results show that importance sampling via estimator augmentation can be orders of magnitude more efficient than parametric bootstrap in estimating tail probabilities for significance tests. This work also brings new insights into the geometry of the sample space and the solution uniqueness of the block Lasso.",2016,arXiv: Methodology

Shrinkage estimation in linear mixed models for longitudinal data,"This paper is concerned with the selection and estimation of fixed effects in linear mixed models while the random effects are treated as nuisance parameters. We propose the non-penalty Jamesâ€“Stein shrinkage and pretest estimation methods based on linear mixed models for longitudinal data when some of the fixed effect parameters are under a linear restriction. We establish the asymptotic distributional biases and risks of the proposed estimators, and investigate their relative performance with respect to the unrestricted maximum likelihood estimator (UE). Furthermore, we investigate the penalty (LASSO and adaptive LASSO) estimation methods and compare their relative performance with the non-penalty pretest and shrinkage estimators. A simulation study for various combinations of the inactive covariates shows that the shrinkage estimators perform better than the penalty estimators in certain parts of the parameter space. This particularly happens when there are many inactive covariates in the model. It also shows that the pretest, shrinkage, and penalty estimators all outperform the UE. We further illustrate the proposed procedures via a real data example.",2018,Metrika

Cluster feature selection in high-dimensional linear models,"This paper concerns with variable screening when highly correlated variables exist in high-dimensional linear models. We propose a novel cluster feature selection (CFS) procedure based on the elastic net and linear correlation variable screening to enjoy the benefits of the two methods. When calculating the correlation between the predictor and the response, we consider highly correlated groups of predictors instead of the individual ones. This is in contrast to the usual linear correlation variable screening. Within each correlated group, we apply the elastic net to select variables and estimate their parameters. This avoids the drawback of mistakenly eliminating true relevant variables when they are highly correlated like LASSO [R. Tibshirani, Regression shrinkage and selection via the lasso, J. R. Stat. Soc. Ser. B 58 (1996) 268â€“288] does. After applying the CFS procedure, the maximum absolute correlation coefficient between clusters becomes smaller and any common model selection methods like sure independence screening (SIS) [J. Fan and J. Lv, Sure independence screening for ultrahigh dimensional feature space, J. R. Stat. Soc. Ser. B 70 (2008) 849â€“911] or LASSO can be applied to improve the results. Extensive numerical examples including pure simulation examples and semi-real examples are conducted to show the good performances of our procedure.",2017,

 and $${\hbox {PM}}_{2.5}$$
 measurement in Europe is active sampling with subsequent gravimetric analysis. Also tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) monitors are widely used across Europe for the assessment of particulate matter (PM), even though they are known to be biased due to the loss of semi-volatile materials attributed to sample heating. In our work we correct TEOM $${\hbox {PM}}_{{10}}$$
 measurements at eight different monitoring sites located in different surroundings and different climates across Slovenia to replicate reference measurements. We use simultaneous reference and TEOM measurements from a period of seven years (2011â€“2017) and assess the advantage of custom defined correction factors (with linear and orthogonal regression) compared to default correction factors. We further try to improve the corrections by adding meteorological parameters as inputs and training a linear model (lasso) and nonlinear model (random forest). Random forest and lasso models also enable us to evaluate the impact of different meteorological parameters or chemical compounds on TEOM measurements. Our results show that TEOM measurements can be efficiently corrected using correction factors defined with two linear regressions (for summer and winter) at most locations across continental Slovenia. Koper, which lies at the sea side, was the most problematic measurement site. There the measurements were the most affected by the meteorological situation, and they could not be successfully corrected.

Censored linear model in high dimensions,"Censored data are quite common in statistics and have been studied in depth in the last years [for some references, see Powell (J Econom 25(3):303â€“325, 1984), Murphy et al. (Math Methods Stat 8(3):407â€“425, 1999), Chay and Powell (J Econ Perspect 15(4):29â€“42, 2001)]. In this paper, we consider censored high-dimensional data. High-dimensional models are in some way more complex than their low-dimensional versions, therefore some different techniques are required. For the linear case, appropriate estimators based on penalised regression have been developed in the last years [see for example Bickel et al. (Ann Stat 37(4):1705â€“1732, 2009), Koltchinskii (Bernoulli 15:799â€“828, 2009)]. In particular, in sparse contexts, the $$l_1$$l1-penalised regression (also known as LASSO) [see Tibshirani (J R Stat Soc Ser B 58:267â€“288, 1996), BÃ¼hlmann and van de Geer (Statistics for high-dimensional data. Springer, Heidelberg, 2011) and reference therein] performs very well. Only few theoretical work was done to analyse censored linear models in a high-dimensional context. We therefore consider a high-dimensional censored linear model, where the response variable is left censored. We propose a new estimator, which aims to work with high-dimensional linear censored data. Theoretical non-asymptotic oracle inequalities are derived.",2014,TEST
Joint sparse canonical correlation analysis for detecting differential imaging genetics modules,"MOTIVATION
Imaging genetics combines brain imaging and genetic information to identify the relationships between genetic variants and brain activities. When the data samples belong to different classes (e.g. disease status), the relationships may exhibit class-specific patterns that can be used to facilitate the understanding of a disease. Conventional approaches often perform separate analysis on each class and report the differences, but ignore important shared patterns.


RESULTS
In this paper, we develop a multivariate method to analyze the differential dependency across multiple classes. We propose a joint sparse canonical correlation analysis method, which uses a generalized fused lasso penalty to jointly estimate multiple pairs of canonical vectors with both shared and class-specific patterns. Using a data fusion approach, the method is able to detect differentially correlated modules effectively and efficiently. The results from simulation studies demonstrate its higher accuracy in discovering both common and differential canonical correlations compared to conventional sparse CCA. Using a schizophrenia dataset with 92 cases and 116 controls including a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array and functional magnetic resonance imaging data, the proposed method reveals a set of distinct SNP-voxel interaction modules for the schizophrenia patients, which are verified to be both statistically and biologically significant.

Sparse Projections over Graph,"Recent study has shown that canonical algorithms such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) can be obtained from graph based dimensionality reduction framework. However, these algorithms yield projective maps which are linear combination of all the original features. The results are difficult to be interpreted psychologically and physiologically. This paper presents a novel technique for learning a sparse projection over graphs. The data in the reduced subspace is represented as a linear combination of a subset of the most relevant features. Comparing to PCA and LDA, the results obtained by sparse projection are often easier to be interpreted. Our algorithm is based on a graph embedding model, which encodes the discriminating and geometrical structure in terms of the data affinity. Once the embedding results are obtained, we then apply regularized regression for learning a set of sparse basis functions. Specifically, by using L1-norm regularizer (e.g. lasso), the sparse projections can be efficiently computed. Experimental results on two document databases demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",2008,
Improved signal unmixing of vegetation using sparse group selection,"Recently, signal unmixing was proposed in remote sensing with the goal to infer physical parameters of materials of interest, such as vegetation, on the ground. The typical approach uses large collections of pure spectra, called spectral libraries, in which many possible states of the vegetation are modeled by simulated or on-site acquired spectra. Spectra randomly selected from these libraries are used as input to dedicated unmixing methods, such as Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA). The spectra leading to the lowest reconstruction error are considered to be representative for the materials present in the pixel, such that the physical parameters of the ground vegetation can be inferred. However, the large number of spectra in the library imposes limits to the performance of this combinatorial approach, mainly related to running time constraints. In this paper, we propose the inclusion of a pre-processing step in the processing chain, based on the group lasso, which has the goal of selecting groups of signatures likely to be present in the mixtures. In this sense, the Group Sparse Unmixing via variable Splitting and Augmented Lagrangian (GSUnSAL) algorithm is used. The signatures contained in the groups selected by GSUnSAL are then used as input for MESMA. Our experiments using a real dataset acquired by an ASD spectrometer in a South-African orchard show that the proposed approach introduces important improvements in the signal unmixing solutions.",2013,2013 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium - IGARSS
Group Lasso Estimation of High-dimensional Covariance Matrices,"In this paper, we consider the Group Lasso estimator of the covariance matrix of a stochastic process corrupted by an additive noise. We propose to estimate the covariance matrix in a high-dimensional setting under the assumption that the process has a sparse representation in a large dictionary of basis functions. Using a matrix regression model, we propose a new methodology for high-dimensional covariance matrix estimation based on empirical contrast regularization by a group Lasso penalty. Using such a penalty, the method selects a sparse set of basis functions in the dictionary used to approximate the process, leading to an approximation of the covariance matrix into a low dimensional space. Consistency of the estimator is studied in Frobenius and operator norms and an application to sparse PCA is proposed.",2011,J. Mach. Learn. Res.
Acoustic Greenâ€™s Function Estimation using Numerical Simulations and Application to Extern Aeroacoustic Beamforming,"Acoustic imaging techniques aims at characterizing the different acoustic sources of noise on an aircraft (jet, fans, wing, landing gears, etc.) using microphone array measurements. Those source identification techniques, among whom the beamforming is the most popular, require the knowledge of the acoustic Green's function of the medium between the estimated sources and the microphones of the array. Unfortunately, those propagation functions are known only for cases of relatively simple complexity. 
In the presence of complex flows, cavities, reecting surfaces like wings and tails, the Green's function is not known and the use of beamforming techniques based on approximate Green's function can lead to errors in the estimation of the location and amplitudes of the sources and can even lead to the apparition of spurious sources. 
The main aim of this thesis is to set up a numerical method for the estimation of the Green's function for aeroacoustic imaging applications. The method must have a minimal computational cost and provide a sufficiently accurate estimation to be used on realistic industrial configurations. 
The proposed methodology takes advantage of the sparsity of the Green's functions in the time-domain to minimize the required simulation time. The close relationship with the domain of system identification makes possible the use of a wide variety of sparsity-based regression algorithms like, among others, the stepwise regression, the lasso and the elastic net. First, the method is validated on complex 3D numerical test cases in the presence of flows and diffracting objects that are typical of those encountered in the industry. For the configurations involving a high number of focus points, the reverse-flow reciprocity decreases significantly the Green's function estimation problem. 
The methodology is finally applied on experimental data obtained on a high lift 2D wing placed in the ONERA CEPRA19 open section anechoic wind tunnel justifying the applicability of the method on realistic industrial configurations.",2018,
cqrReg: An R Package for Quantile and Composite Quantile Regression and Variable Selection,"The cqrReg package for R is the first to introduce a family of robust, high-dimensional regression models for quantile and composite quantile regression, both with and without an adaptive lasso penalty for variable selection. In this paper, we reformulate these quantile regression problems and present the estimators we implement in cqrReg using alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), majorize-minimization (MM), and coordinate descent (CD) algorithms. Our new approaches address the lack of publicly-available methods for (composite) quantile regression, both with and without regularization. We demonstrate the need for a variety of algorithms in later simulation studies. For comparison, we also introduce the widely-used interior point (IP) formulation and test our methods against the advanced IP algorithms in the existing quantreg package. Our simulation studies show that each of our methods, particularly MM and CD, excel in different settings such as with large or high-dimensional data sets, respectively, and outperform the methods currently implemented in quantreg. ADMM offers particular promise for future developments in its amenability to parallelization.",2017,arXiv: Computation
Lasso peptides: chemical approaches and structural elucidation.,"The discovery and development of novel constrained peptides that combine the advantages of therapeutic proteins with those of small molecules has partially prompted the re-emergence of peptides as therapeutics. In this regard, lasso peptides are characterized by both the selectivity and potency of larger protein biologics but with no or low immunogenicity, and the stability and bioavailability of small molecules. Moreover, the diverse functionality of lasso peptides and their extraordinary stability against chemical, thermal and proteolytic degradation make them attractive candidates for drug discovery. However, the chemical synthesis of lasso peptides remains a challenge due to the difficulty in building and maintaining their threaded structure. From a therapeutic point of view, these small and constrained structures would provide a new paradigm in drug discovery.",2018,Organic & biomolecular chemistry
Labelset anchored subspace ensemble (LASE) for multi-label annotation,"In multimedia retrieval, multi-label annotation for image, text and video is challenging and attracts rapidly growing interests in past decades. The main crux of multi-label annotation lies on 1) how to reduce the model complexity when the label space expands exponentially with the increase of the number of labels; and 2) how to leverage the label correlations which have broadly believed useful for boosting annotation performance. In this paper, we propose ""labelsets anchored subspace ensemble (LASE)"" to solve both problems in an efficient scheme, whose training is a regularized matrix decomposition and prediction is an inference of group sparse representations. In order to shrink the label space, we firstly introduce ""label distilling"" extracting the frequent labelsets to replace the original labels. In the training stage, the data matrix is decomposed as the sum of several low-rank matrices and a sparse residual via a randomized optimization, where each low-rank part defines a feature subspace mapped by a labelset. A manifold regularization is applied to map the labelset geometry to the geometry of the obtained subspaces. In the prediction stage, the group sparse representation of a new sample on the subspace ensemble is estimated by group lasso. The selected subspaces indicate the labelsets that the sample should be annotated with. Experiments on several benchmark datasets of texts, images, web data and videos validate the appealing performance of LASE in multi-label annotation.",2012,
Behavior of Lasso Quantile Regression with Small Sample Sizes,"Quantile regression is a statistical technique intended to estimate, and conduct inference about the conditional quantile functions. Just as the classical linear regression methods estimate models for conditional mean function, quantile regression offers a mechanism for estimating models for conditional median function, and the full range of other conditional quantile functions. In this paper describe, compare, and apply the two quantile regression (L1-Lasso, L2-Lasso) suggested approaches. The two quantile regression suggested approaches used to select the best subset of variables and estimate the parameters of the quantile regression equation when small sample sizes are used. The aim of this study is to study the behavior of L1Lasso and L2 -Lasso quantile regression method when small sample sizes are generated. Simulations show that the proposed approaches are very competitive in terms of variable selection, estimation accuracy and efficient when small sample sizes are used.

NUOVE TECNOLOGIE PER LA VALUTAZIONE DEL DEGRADO E IL CONTROLLO DI STRUTTURE IN CALCESTRUZZO ARMATO PRECOMPRESSO Risanamenti Strutturali,"calcestruzzo precompresso sono considerevolmente differenti da quelle utilizzate per le strutture in c.a. convenzionali. In generale, vi Ã¨ una ridotta evidenza esterna dei danni o del deterioramento della struttura. La fuoriuscita occasionale di qualche cavo dagli ancoraggi o dalla superficie di travi o di lastre potrebbe non essere sufficiente a identificare un danneggiamento in atto. Le strutture in calcestruzzo armato precompresso sono strutture critiche per quanto riguarda lâ€™applicabilitÃ  delle tecniche di indagine convenzionali, nel senso che le informazioni ottenute con queste ultime sono insufficienti a dare un quadro conoscitivo adeguato sulle reali condizioni di degrado.

Improving case definition of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis in electronic medical records using natural language processing: a novel informatics approach.,"BACKGROUND
Previous studies identifying patients with inflammatory bowel disease using administrative codes have yielded inconsistent results. Our objective was to develop a robust electronic medical record-based model for classification of inflammatory bowel disease leveraging the combination of codified data and information from clinical text notes using natural language processing.


METHODS
Using the electronic medical records of 2 large academic centers, we created data marts for Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) comprising patients with â‰¥1 International Classification of Diseases, 9th edition, code for each disease. We used codified (i.e., International Classification of Diseases, 9th edition codes, electronic prescriptions) and narrative data from clinical notes to develop our classification model. Model development and validation was performed in a training set of 600 randomly selected patients for each disease with medical record review as the gold standard. Logistic regression with the adaptive LASSO penalty was used to select informative variables.


RESULTS
We confirmed 399 CD cases (67%) in the CD training set and 378 UC cases (63%) in the UC training set. For both, a combined model including narrative and codified data had better accuracy (area under the curve for CD 0.95; UC 0.94) than models using only disease International Classification of Diseases, 9th edition codes (area under the curve 0.89 for CD; 0.86 for UC). Addition of natural language processing narrative terms to our final model resulted in classification of 6% to 12% more subjects with the same accuracy.


CONCLUSIONS
Inclusion of narrative concepts identified using natural language processing improves the accuracy of electronic medical records case definition for CD and UC while simultaneously identifying more subjects compared with models using codified data alone.",2013,Inflammatory bowel diseases
Distributed Spectrum Sensing for Cognitive Radio Networks by Exploiting Sparsity,"A cooperative approach to the sensing task of wireless cognitive radio (CR) networks is introduced based on a basis expansion model of the power spectral density (PSD) map in space and frequency. Joint estimation of the model parameters enables identification of the (un)used frequency bands at arbitrary locations, and thus facilitates spatial frequency reuse. The novel scheme capitalizes on two forms of sparsity: the first one introduced by the narrow-band nature of transmit-PSDs relative to the broad swaths of usable spectrum; and the second one emerging from sparsely located active radios in the operational space. An estimator of the model coefficients is developed based on the Lasso algorithm to exploit these forms of sparsity and reveal the unknown positions of transmitting CRs. The resultant scheme can be implemented via distributed online iterations, which solve quadratic programs locally (one per radio), and are adaptive to changes in the system. Simulations corroborate that exploiting sparsity in CR sensing reduces spatial and frequency spectrum leakage by 15 dB relative to least-squares (LS) alternatives.",2010,IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing
Development and Validation of an MRI-Based Radiomics Signature for the Preoperative Prediction of Lymph Node Metastasis in Bladder Cancer,"BACKGROUND
Preoperative lymph node (LN) status is important for the treatment of bladder cancer (BCa). However, a proportion of patients are at high risk for inaccurate clinical nodal staging by current methods. Here, we report an accurate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based radiomics signature for the individual preoperative prediction of LN metastasis in BCa.


METHODS
In total, 103 eligible BCa patients were divided into a training set (nâ€¯=â€¯69) and a validation set (nâ€¯=â€¯34). And 718 radiomics features were extracted from the cancerous volumes of interest (VOIs) on T2-weighted MRI images. A radiomics signature was constructed using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm in the training set, whose performance was assessed and then validated in the validation set. Stratified analyses were also performed. Based on the multivariable logistic regression analysis, a radiomics nomogram was developed incorporating the radiomics signature and selected clinical predictors. Discrimination, calibration and clinical usefulness of the nomogram were assessed.


FINDINGS
Consisting of 9 selected features, the radiomics signature showed a favorable discriminatory ability in the training set with an AUC of 0.9005, which was confirmed in the validation set with an AUC of 0.8447. Encouragingly, the radiomics signature also showed good discrimination in the MRI-reported LN negative (cN0) subgroup (AUC, 0.8406). The nomogram, consisting of the radiomics signature and the MRI-reported LN status, showed good calibration and discrimination in the training and validation sets (AUC, 0.9118 and 0.8902, respectively). The decision curve analysis indicated that the nomogram was clinically useful.


INTERPRETATION
The MRI-based radiomics nomogram has the potential to be used as a non-invasive tool for individualized preoperative prediction of LN metastasis in BCa. External validation is further required prior to clinical implementation.",2018,EBioMedicine
The Role of 22 Genes Expression in Bladder Cancer by Adaptive LASSO,"Background: Genetic expression has been frequently considered as an efficient method for early diagnosis of cancer. In this study, we examined the simultaneous effect of 22 genes on contribution to bladder cancer. Objectives: Since these 22 genes are known as the most important risk factors in many cancers, we aimed to investigate them as potential effective genes in bladder cancer. Methods: The data consist of 25 patients with bladder cancer (the case group) and 23 matched healthy individuals as a control group. Univariate analysis was performed and differences between two groups were analyzed through the independent T-test. A multivariate gene expression model was implemented using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and Adaptive LASSO regression. Standard error of coefficients was obtained using the bootstrap method. We used two methods for classification and compared areas under the curve (AUC), using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Results: Independent T-test showed that 11 genes had a significant difference between the two groups. Also multivariate analysis using the LASSO revealed that 12 genes have a significant effect on bladder cancer and adaptive lasso regression represented SDF1, CTLA-4, Her2 and IL-23 genes as the most effective genes. The AUC for LASSO and Adaptive LASSO were 0.71 and 0.89, respectively which was statistically significant (P = 0.009). Our multivariable results for SDF1, CTLA-4 and IL-23 confirm the findings of many studies in this field. Conclusions: Among all genes were examined, SDF1, CTLA-4, Her2 and IL-23 which were selected by the two methods has the greatest contribution to bladder cancer.",2016,Iranian journal of cancer prevention

Correlation Between Tumor Metabolism and Semiquantitative Perfusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging Metrics in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.,"PURPOSE
To correlate semiquantitative parameters derived from dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG-PET) for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).


METHODS AND MATERIALS
Twenty-four NSCLC patients who underwent pretreatment 18F-FDG-PET and DCE-MRI were analyzed. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) was measured from 18F-FDG-PET. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI was obtained on a 3T MRI scanner using 4-dimensional T1-weighted high-resolution imaging with a volume excitation sequence. The DCE-MRI parameters, consisting of mean, median, standard deviation (SD), and median absolute deviation (MAD) of peak enhancement, time to peak (TTP), time to half peak (TTHP), wash-in slope (WIS), wash-out slope (WOS), initial gradient, wash-out gradient, signal enhancement ratio, and initial area under the relative signal enhancement curve taken up to 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180Â seconds, TTP, and TTHP (IAUCtthp), were calculated for each lesion. Univariate analysis (UVA) was performed using Spearman correlation. A linear regression model to predict SUVmax from DCE-MRI parameters was developed by multivariate analysis (MVA) using least absolute shrinkage selection operator in combination with leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV).


RESULTS
In UVA, mean(WOS) (ÏÂ =Â -0.456, PÂ =Â .025), mean(IAUCtthp) (ÏÂ =Â -0.439, PÂ =Â .032), median(IAUCtthp) (ÏÂ =Â -0.543, PÂ =Â .006), and MAD(IAUCtthp) (ÏÂ =Â -0.557, PÂ =Â .005) were statistically significant; all these parameters were negatively correlated with SUVmax. In MVA, a linear combination of SD(WIS), SD(TTP), MAD(TTHP), and MAD(IAUCtthp) was statistically significant for predicting SUVmax (LOOCV-based adjusted R2Â =Â 0.298, PÂ =Â .0006). A decrease in SD(WIS), MAD(TTHP), and MAD(IAUCtthp) and an increase in SD(TTP) were associated with a significant increase in SUVmax.


CONCLUSION
An association was found between SUVmax, the SD, and MAD of DCE-MRI metrics derived during contrast uptake in NSCLC, reflecting that intratumoral heterogeneity in wash-in contrast kinetics is associated with tumor metabolism. Although MAD(IAUCtthp) was a significant feature in both UVA and MVA, the LASSO-based multivariate regression model yielded better predictability of SUVmax than a univariate regression model using MAD(IAUCtthp). This study will facilitate understanding of the complex relationship between tumor vascularization and metabolism and eventually help in guiding targeted therapy.",2018,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics"
"Health Effects of PM2.5 and Its Components on Mortality, Blood Pressure, and DNA Methylation","Epidemiological studies have examined the association between PM2.5 mass and mortality, but there remains uncertainty about the relative importance of species. PM2.5 contains various species, such as organic carbon, elemental carbon, and metals. Determining the differential toxicity of PM2.5 species and identifying species with greatest toxicity is of great importance to emissioncontrol strategies and regulations. In the dissertation thesis, effects of PM2.5 species on health outcomes on different levels were estimated. The first study examined the association between PM2.5 species and mortality on approximately 4.5 million deaths for all causes, cardiovascular diseases, myocardial infarction, stroke, and respiratory diseases in 75 U.S. cities for 2000-2006, using city-season specific Poisson regression and multivariate meta-regression controlled for infiltration. Since cardiovascular diseases are leading causes of death within U.S. population, the second study aimed to determine which PM2.5 species are associated with blood pressure, an indicator of cardiovascular health, in a longitudinal cohort. Linear mixed-effects models with the adaptive LASSO penalty were applied to longitudinal data from 718 elderly men in the Veterans Affairs Normative Aging Study (NAS),",2018,

"Heterologous Expression of a Cryptic Gene Cluster from Streptomyces leeuwenhoekii C34T Yields a Novel Lasso Peptide, Leepeptin","Analysis of the genome sequence of Streptomyces leeuwenhoekii C34T identified biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) for three different lasso peptides (Lp1, Lp2 and Lp3) which were not known to be made by the strain. Lasso peptides are a relatively new member of the RiPP (ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides) family of natural products and have not been extensively studied. Lp3, whose production could be detected in culture supernatants from S. leeuwenhoekii C34T and after heterologous expression of its BGC in Streptomyces coelicolor, is identical to the previously characterised chaxapeptin. Lp1, whose production could not be detected or achieved heterologously, appears to be identical to a recently identified member of the citrulassin family of lasso peptides. Since production of Lp2 by S. leeuwenhoekii C34T was not observed, its BGC was also expressed in S. coelicolor The lasso peptide was isolated and its structure confirmed by mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses revealing a novel structure that appears to represent a new family of lasso peptides.IMPORTANCE Recent developments in genome sequencing combined with bioinformatic analysis have revealed that actinomycetes contain a plethora of unexpected BGCs and thus have the potential to produce many more natural products than previously thought. This reflects the inability to detect the production of these compounds under laboratory conditions, perhaps through the use of inappropriate growth media or the absence of the environmental cues required to elicit expression of the corresponding BGCs. One approach to overcoming this problem is to circumvent the regulatory mechanisms that control expression of the BGC in its natural host by deploying heterologous expression. The generally compact nature of lasso peptide BGCs makes them particularly amenable to this approach, and in the example given here revealed a new member of the lasso peptide family of RiPPs. This approach should be readily applicable to other cryptic lasso peptide gene clusters and would also facilitate the design and production of non-natural variants by changing the sequence encoding the core peptide, as has been achieved with other classes of RiPPs.",2019,Applied and Environmental Microbiology

"Molecular systematics of Haploginglymus, a genus of subterranean amphipods endemic to the Iberian Peninsula (Amphipoda: Niphargidae)","The molecular systematics of the subterranean amphipod genus Haploginglymus is addressed through the phylogenetic analysis of three DNA gene fragments (nuclear ribosomal 28S and protein-coding Histone 3, plus mitochondrial Cytochrome c Oxidase subunit I). We take advantage of the description of a new species from southern Spain (Haploginglymus geos sp. nov.) to assess the singularity of this genus endemic to the Iberian Peninsula and the inclusion of the morphologically aberrant H. morenoi within Haploginglymus. Our results corroborate the monophyly of the family Niphargidae but shows Niphargus to be paraphyletic as it currently stands, with Haploginglymus appearing nested within it. A strongly supported sister-group relationship between niphargids and the (thalassoid) pseudoniphargids is recovered as well, but we propose the Niphargidae should continue to be considered as a primary limnic group for biogeographic purposes despite its presumed marine derivation. Our findings are in agreement with previous studies that suggest the family Niphargidae originated in the late Cretaceous in the NE Atlantic, from where it eventually expanded across continental Europe.",2017,Contributions to Zoology
Nuclear Microprobe Studies of Elemental Distribution in the Seagrass Thalassodendron Ciliatum,"Elemental levels and distributions in various organs (leaves, upright stems, rhizomes and roots) of the seagrass Thalassodendron ciliatum were determined using the NAC nuclear microprobe. Elemental distributions were obtained using the true elemental imaging system Dynamic Analysis (DA). Cl was the most abundant element present in the organs, occurring in all tissues, but present in relatively low concentrations in epidermal cells of leaves and roots. Na, K, S and Mg were also abundant and occurred in all organ tissues. Ca concentration was highest in the leaves, especially in the epidermis. Low concentrations of P were found and its tissue distribution was limited. Although Fe, Cu, Zn, Mn, Br, Ti and Si were present in relatively small amounts, enrichment of the epidermis with Fe, Ti and Si in all organs, was observed. Fe concentration was the highest in rhizomes while Si concentration was highest in upright stems. The significance of these elemental distribution patterns and the value of the nuclear microprobe in elemental analysis of seagrasses are discussed. â€ 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Visual object tracking via coefficients constrained exclusive group LASSO,"Discriminative methods have been widely applied to construct the appearance model for visual tracking. Most existing methods incorporate online updating strategy to adapt to the appearance variations of targets. The focus of online updating for discriminative methods is to select the positive samples emerged in past frames to represent the appearances. However, the appearances of positive samples might be very dissimilar to each other; traditional online updating strategies easily overfit on some appearances and neglect the others. To address this problem, we propose an effective method to learn a discriminative template, which maintains the multiple appearances information of targets in the long-term variations. Our method is based on the obvious observation that the target appearances vary very little in a certain number of successive video frames. Therefore, we can use a few instances to represent the appearances in the scope of the successive video frames. We propose exclusive group sparse to describe the observation and provide a novel algorithm, called coefficients constrained exclusive group LASSO, to solve it in a single objective function. The experimental results on CVPR2013 benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves promising performance.",2018,Machine Vision and Applications
Constrain to perform : Regularization of habitat models,"Predictive habitat models are an important tool for ecological research and conservation. A major cause of unreliable models is excessive model complexity, and regularization methods aim to improve the predictive performance by adequately constraining model complexity. We compare three regularization methods for logistic regression: variable selection, lasso, and ridge. They differ in the way model complexity is measured: variable selection uses the number of estimated parameters, the lasso uses the sum of the absolute values of the parameter estimates, and the ridge uses the sum of the squared values of the parameter estimates. 
 
We performed a simulation study with environmental data of a real landscape and artificial species occupancy data. We investigated the effect of three factors on relative model performance: (1) the number of parameters (16, 10, 6, 2) in the â€˜trueâ€™ model that determined the distribution of the artificial species, (2) the prevalence, i.e. the proportion of sites occupied by the species, and (3) the sample size (measured in events per variable, EPV). 
 
Regularization improved model discrimination and calibration. However, no regularization method performed best under all circumstances: the ridge generally performed best in the 16-parameter scenario. The lasso generally performed best in the 10-parameter scenario. Variable selection with AIC was best at large sample sizes (EPVâ‰¥10) when less than half of the variables influenced the species distribution. However, at low sample sizes (EPV<10), ridge and lasso always performed best, regardless of the parameter scenario or prevalence. Overall, calibration was best in ridge models. Other methods showed overconfidence, particularly at low sample sizes. The percentage of correctly identified models was low for both lasso and variable selection. 
 
Variable selection should be used with caution. Although it can produce the best performing models under certain conditions, these situations are difficult to infer from the data. Ridge and lasso are risk-averse model strategies that can be expected to perform well under a wide range of underlying speciesâ€“habitat relationships, particularly at small sample sizes.",2006,Ecological Modelling
A general framework for solving convex optimization problems involving the sum of three convex functions,"In this paper, we consider solving a class of convex optimization problem which minimizes the sum of three convex functions $f(x)+g(x)+h(Bx)$, where $f(x)$ is differentiable with a Lipschitz continuous gradient, $g(x)$ and $h(x)$ have a closed-form expression of their proximity operators and $B$ is a bounded linear operator. This type of optimization problem has wide application in signal recovery and image processing. To make full use of the differentiability function in the optimization problem, we take advantage of two operator splitting methods: the forward-backward splitting method and the three operator splitting method. In the iteration scheme derived from the two operator splitting methods, we need to compute the proximity operator of $g+h \circ B$ and $h \circ B$, respectively. Although these proximity operators do not have a closed-form solution in general, they can be solved very efficiently. We mainly employ two different approaches to solve these proximity operators: one is dual and the other is primal-dual. Following this way, we fortunately find that three existing iterative algorithms including Condat and Vu algorithm, primal-dual fixed point (PDFP) algorithm and primal-dual three operator (PD3O) algorithm are a special case of our proposed iterative algorithms. Moreover, we discover a new kind of iterative algorithm to solve the considered optimization problem, which is not covered by the existing ones. Under mild conditions, we prove the convergence of the proposed iterative algorithms. Numerical experiments applied on fused Lasso problem, constrained total variation regularization in computed tomography (CT) image reconstruction and low-rank total variation image super-resolution problem demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed iterative algorithms.",2017,arXiv: Optimization and Control
Private finance initiative in incomplete contracts: Theory and evidence from Japan,"Abstract Private finance initiative (PFI) is a way of creating ""publicâ€“private partnerships"" (PPPs) where private firms are contracted to complete and manage public projects. The purpose of this paper is to investigate how to achieve a desirable procurement contract in PFIs. In the first part, we develop an incomplete contracting model to analyze the effectiveness of PFIs. We show that an appropriate fixed compensation is important in disentangling adverse selection. In the second part, we test the validity of this theoretical implication by case study of â€œThalasso Fukuokaâ€ and by cross-sectional analysis on Japanâ€™s PFIs. The case study indicates that adverse selection under overestimated value for money (VFM) was a major reason for why the project failed. The cross-sectional analysis also shows that when the local government had overestimated the initial VFM, adverse selection discouraged private companies with higher reservation profits to apply for the project. It suggests that the overestimated initial VFM could make the project less productive even if it did not lead the project to bankrupcy.",2019,Japan and the World Economy
Development of a Prediction Model for Stress Fracture During an Intensive Physical Training Program: The Royal Marines Commandos,"Background: Stress fractures (SFs) are one of the more severe overuse injuries in military training, and therefore, knowledge of potential risk factors is needed to assist in developing mitigating strategies. Purpose: To develop a prediction model for risk of SF in Royal Marines (RM) recruits during an arduous military training program. Study Design: Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: RM recruits (N = 1082; age range, 16-33 years) who enrolled between September 2009 and July 2010 were prospectively followed through the 32-week RM training program. SF diagnosis was confirmed from a positive radiograph or magnetic resonance imaging scan. Potential risk factors assessed at week 1 included recruit characteristics, anthropometric assessment, dietary supplement use, lifestyle habits, fitness assessment, blood samples, 25(OH)D, bone strength as measured by heel broadband ultrasound attention, history of physical activity, and previous and current food intake. A logistic least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression with 10-fold cross-validation was used to select potential predictors among 47 candidate variables. Model performance was assessed using measures of discrimination (c-index) and calibration. Bootstrapping was used for internal validation of the developed model and to quantify optimism. Results: A total of 86 (8%) volunteer recruits presented at least 1 SF during training. Twelve variables were identified as the most important risk factors of SF. Variables strongly associated with SF were age, body weight, pretraining weightbearing exercise, pretraining cycling, and childhood intake of milk and milk products. The c-index for the prediction model, which represents the model performance in future volunteers, was 0.73 (optimism-corrected c-index, 0.68). Although 25(OH)D and VO2max had only a borderline statistically significant association with SF, the inclusion of these factors improved the performance of the model. Conclusion: These findings will assist in identifying recruits at greater risk of SF during training and will support interventions to mitigate this injury risk. However, external validation of the model is still required.",2017,Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine
Selecting pre-screening items for early intervention trials of dementia--a case study.,"Our goal was to review and extend statistical methods for discriminating between normal subjects and those with dementia or cognitive impairment. We compared six different methods to one constructed by expert opinion, in their brevity and predictive power. The methods include logistic regression and neural networks, with standard and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) variable selection, as well as decision trees with and without boosting. These methods were applied to the baseline data of a subgroup of subjects in a dementia study, using their screening interview items to predict their clinical diagnosis of normal or non-normal (cognitively impaired or demented). The derived models were then validated on a different subgroup of subjects in the same study who had the screening and clinical diagnosis two to five years later. Performance of different models was compared based on their sensitivity and specificity in the validation sample. Generally, the six statistical methods performed slightly to moderately better than the expert-opinion model. Neural networks generally performed better than the logistic and decision tree models. LASSO improved the performance of logistic and neural network models, but it eliminated few input variables in the neural network. The single decision tree performed at least as well as the standard logistic model, and with fewer items, making it an attractive pre-screening tool. Using the boosting option for decision trees did not substantially improve the performance. We recommend that for each situation, different methods of classification should be attempted to obtain optimal results for a given purpose.",2004,Statistics in medicine
A Stepwise Algorithm for Generalized Linear Mixed Models,"Stepwise regression includes regression models in which the predictive variables are selected by an automated algorithm. The stepwise method involves two approaches, namely, backward elimination and forward selection. Currently, SAS has several regression procedures capable of performing stepwise regression. Among them are REG, LOGISTIC, GLMSELECT and PHREG. PROC REG handles linear regression model but does not support a CLASS statement. PROC LOGISTIC handles binary responses and allows for logit, probit and complementary log-log link functions. It also allows for CLASS statements. The GLMSELECT procedure performs selections in the framework of general linear models. It allows for a variety of model selection methods, including the LASSO method of Tibshirani (1996) and the related LAR method of Efron et al. (2004). GLMSELECT supports a CLASS statement. PHREG is appropriate for proportional hazard survival regression. We present a stepwise algorithm for Generalized Linear Mixed Models for both marginal and conditional models. We illustrate the algorithm using data from a longitudinal observational study aimed to investigate parentsâ€™ beliefs, behaviors, feeding practices that associate positively or negatively with indices of sleep quality.",2014,
La sindicaciÃ³ dels funcionaris de la Generalitat de Catalunya (1931-1939),"Les planes que ocupen tot aquest llarg estudi analitzen els projectes de sindicacio i associacio corporativa dels funcionaris de la Generalitat de Catalunya, fonamentalment lAssociacio de Funcionaris de la Generalitat de Catalunya (AFGC), durant els anys 1931-1939. Tanmateix, no sels analitza com a subjectes passius a remolc dels esdeveniments politics, sino com a elements actius de la politica catalana dels anys trenta. Per tant, es parteix de la idea motor que la major part de la classe politica catalana del periode republica formava part de la funcio publica, tant local com regional, com de ladministracio central de lestat. Aixo implica un enorme protagonisme del funcionariat en tots els processos de canvi i de transformacio politica, social, economica i cultural que sesdevingueren a Catalunya durant la II Republica. Aixi, les planes daquest treball intentaran posar de manifest que el classic discurs regeneracionista del catalanisme, fonamentat en la necessitat de reformar lestat, era, entre altres raons, una proposta dadequar lestructura de lestat espanyol a les necessitats de promocio professional de les classes mitjanes catalanistes a traves de ladministracio publica. En rigor, laspiracio de lautonomia, en termes pragmatics, suposava la voluntat de crear un espai de promocio socioprofessional per a aquestes noves classes mitjanes emergents que havien derivat cap el catalanisme politic com a contrapes a unes classes mitjanes de signe republica lerrouxista o militar que primaren les vies de ladministracio municipal o central com a vies de promocio.
La concrecio de lautonomia regional, a partir de lany 1931 amb la Generalitat provisional i del 1932 amb lestatut dautonomia, desferma entre les classes mitjanes republicanes i catalanistes una veritable fam de conquesta de llocs de treball publics. I aquesta situacio defini bona part del joc de rivalitats politiques dels anys trenta a Catalunya. Fou per aquesta rao que es configuraren tota una serie dassociacions corporatives de lanomenada classe funcionarial de la Generalitat i que tingueren per objectiu la defensa dels interessos professionals duns empleats publics que sentiren una enorme inseguretat laboral dins duna administracio tot just acabada de crear. Per aixo, es pot parlar que, a Catalunya, la revolucio republicana del 1931 fou una revolucio de funcionaris i daspirants a funcionaris que veieren en lautonomia regional la seva gran finestra doportunitats. Tanmateix, seria erroni creure que la revolucio del 1936 posa fi a tot aquest proces de creixement de la funcio publica autonomica, sino tot el contrari. La gran rivalitat entre catalanistes radicals i anarcosindicalistes durant el 1931-1936 no fou estrictament una rivalitat entre els oficinistes, funcionaris i dependentes del sector dels serveis contra els obrers manuals. Pel contrari, fou una confrontacio entre aquells que van voler conservar els seus llocs de treball publics i aquells que els volien destruir perque no hi podien disposar dells (i en aquesta linia hi tingue un pes fonamental el tradicional discurs antiestatista dels llibertaris), Ara be, quan va esclatar la febre revolucionaria de lestiu del 1936, la CNT no va dubtar a renunciar (almenys els seus dirigents) al comunisme llibertari per tal de conquerir el maxim espai de poder public que es concreta en una nova revolucio daspirants a funcionaris, aquesta vegada procedents del sector dels obrers manuals. I, per aquesta rao, la mateixa CNT va acabar, malgrat el seu teoric i mitificat antiestatisme, creant el corresponent Sindicat Unic de Funcionaris de la Generalitat. En rigor, bona part del joc politic dels anys trenta a Catalunya va girar a lentorn de la lluita pel control dels llocs de treball publics i de ladministracio, fet que contradiu els discursos tradicionals de les formacions politiques catalanistes i obreristes que sempre negaren la legitimitat de lestat fos espanyol o de qualsevol mena: uns, pel seu caracter uniformista, i, els altres, per la seva dificultat daccedir-hi per merits academics als llocs de feina publics. Certament, un cop catalanistes i llibertaris pogueren aspirar a formar part de la funcio publica donaren a coneixer un discurs i unes actituds allunyades del classic regeneracionisme antiestatalista.
This study analyzes the corporative association projects of Generalitat de Catalunya public officials, especially the Associacio de Funcionaris de la Generalitat de Catalunya (AFGC), among the years 1931-1939. The public officials not were passive subjects of the political events. Really, the public officials were active subjects of the political events. First idea: more members of the catalonian political classe in 1931-1939 were public officials in the local, regional and central state administrations. In fact, it means a very important starring of public officials in the political, social, economic and cultural change process in Catalonian during the Second Republic. This study analyzes also the regeneracionist discourse of the catalanism movement, based in the state reform and the professional promotion of the middle class in the local, regional and central state administration.
The regional autonomy instaured in april 1931 with the Generalitat de Catalunya and the Devolution Statute aproved in september 1932 awoke in the republican and catalanist middle class an important expectative to conquest public emploiment. And this fact, defined the political rivalities in Catalonian during 1931-1939. In this way, many public officials corporative associations were founded and heir objectives were, basically, the defenseof public officials interests into a new administration like catalonian regional autonomy. For this reason, its possible to say that republicain revolution of 1931 was also a public officials revolution. In the other side, rivalry between radical catalanists and anarcosindicalists during 1931-1936 wasnt only a rivalry between white collars and manual workers; also was a rivalry between those of white collars who wanted to conserve their public employment and those of manual workers who wanted to aspire a public emploiment. Ceirtanly, in summer 1936, CNT didnt doubt to renounce (especially their leaders) to the anarchist utopia, and so to conquest the maxim politic power possible into the local, regional and central sate administration. So, it happened a new revolution: anarchists and not anarchists manual workers conquered public official emploiments into local, regional and central state administration. So, CNT founded a trade union called Sindicat Unic de Funcionaris de la Generalitat de Catalunya (SUFGC). In fact, political life in 1931-1939 was based in the fight for public official employments.",2007,
Islands beneath islands: phylogeography of a groundwater amphipod crustacean in the Balearic archipelago,"BackgroundMetacrangonyctidae (Amphipoda, Crustacea) is an enigmatic continental subterranean water family of marine origin (thalassoid). One of the species in the genus, Metacrangonyx longipes, is endemic to the Balearic islands of Mallorca and Menorca (W Mediterranean). It has been suggested that the origin and distribution of thalassoid crustaceans could be explained by one of two alternative hypotheses: (1) active colonization of inland freshwater aquifers by a marine ancestor, followed by an adaptative shift; or (2) passive colonization by stranding of ancestral marine populations in coastal aquifers during marine regressions. A comparison of phylogenies, phylogeographic patterns and age estimations of clades should discriminate in favour of one of these two proposals.ResultsPhylogenetic relationships within M. longipes based on three mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and one nuclear marker revealed five genetically divergent and geographically structured clades. Analyses of cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) mtDNA data showed the occurrence of a high geographic population subdivision in both islands, with current gene flow occurring exclusively between sites located in close proximity. Molecular-clock estimations dated the origin of M. longipes previous to about 6 Ma, whereas major cladogenetic events within the species took place between 4.2 and 2.0 Ma.ConclusionsM. longipes displayed a surprisingly old and highly fragmented population structure, with major episodes of cladogenesis within the species roughly correlating with some of the major marine transgression-regression episodes that affected the region during the last 6 Ma. Eustatic changes (vicariant events) -not active range expansion of marine littoral ancestors colonizing desalinated habitats-explain the phylogeographic pattern observed in M. longipes.",2011,BMC Evolutionary Biology
The incorporation of zinc and iron into the frustule of the marine diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana,"Zinc and iron uptake experiments were conducted with the marine diatom Thalassosira pseudonana,to investigate whether Zn and Fe are incorporated into the frustule of this diatom. Our results show that the uptake and deposition of Zn into opal has a sigmoidal relationship with the free Zn 21 concentration of the culture medium. The amount of Zn incorporated into the opal represents only 1â€3% of the total amount of Zn taken up by the diatom; however, the exact reasons for Zn incorporation into the opal are not known. Even so, the consistent relationship between Zn levels in the opal and the culture medium suggests that fossil diatoms may be used as a recorder for historical changes in oceanic free Zn 21 concentrations. These results also demonstrate that the Zn : Si(OH) 4 relationship observed in the Pacific and Antarctic Oceans is not a result of Zn released from biogenic opal. Fe uptake experiments also revealed that Fe is incorporated into diatom opal; however, the amount incorporated appears to be regulated by the diatom and did not increase with increasing Fe concentration within the diatom culture medium. This therefore eliminates the use of Fe incorporated within diatom opal as a possible proxy for dissolved Fe concentrations.",2000,Limnology and Oceanography
Explanatory Model of Dry Eye Disease Using Health and Nutrition Examinations: Machine Learning and Network-Based Factor Analysis From a National Survey,"BACKGROUND
Dry eye disease (DED) is a complex disease of the ocular surface, and its associated factors are important for understanding and effectively treating DED.


OBJECTIVE
This study aimed to provide an integrative and personalized model of DED by making an explanatory model of DED using as many factors as possible from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) data.


METHODS
Using KNHANES data for 2012 (4391 sample cases), a point-based scoring system was created for ranking factors associated with DED and assessing patient-specific DED risk. First, decision trees and lasso were used to classify continuous factors and to select important factors, respectively. Next, a survey-weighted multiple logistic regression was trained using these factors, and points were assigned using the regression coefficients. Finally, network graphs of partial correlations between factors were utilized to study the interrelatedness of DED-associated factors.


RESULTS
The point-based model achieved an area under the curve of 0.70 (95% CI 0.61-0.78), and 13 of 78 factors considered were chosen. Important factors included sex (+9 points for women), corneal refractive surgery (+9 points), current depression (+7 points), cataract surgery (+7 points), stress (+6 points), age (54-66 years; +4 points), rhinitis (+4 points), lipid-lowering medication (+4 points), and intake of omega-3 (0.43%-0.65% kcal/day; -4 points). Among these, the age group 54 to 66 years had high centrality in the network, whereas omega-3 had low centrality.


CONCLUSIONS
Integrative understanding of DED was possible using the machine learning-based model and network-based factor analysis. This method for finding important risk factors and identifying patient-specific risk could be applied to other multifactorial diseases.",2020,JMIR Medical Informatics

[Principles of palliative motor surgery of paralysis of the hand].,"The purpose of surgical restoration of the paralysed hand is to use or to reconstruct the physiological tenodesis effects which are linked on to flexion-extension motions of the wrist. Active movements of interphalangeal (IP) flexion and metacarpo-phalangeal (MP) extension of the fingers are made by extrinsic muscles coming from the forearm. The intrinsic muscles of the fingers produce MP flexion and IP extension. A claw deformity occurs when they are completely paralysed in a finger whose joints are flexible, and whose extrinsic muscles remains functional or are restored. When Bouvier's maneuver is positive, the claw is said simple, and its treatment is either MP capsuloplasty when there is no motors, or an active palliative procedure with proximal (or MP) effect when motors exist: lasso and/or direct interosseous activation. Indications of the classical active palliative procedures with distal (or IP) effect remain rare, only in a few complicated claw deformities. Circumduction of the thumb may be decomposed into three elementary movements: reposition, antepulsion, and adduction, which are respectively controlled by the radial, median, and ulnar nerves. Each of these movements may be restored by a specific tendinous transfer. In the total paralysis of the thumb as we observe in high tetraplegia, a key-grip may be restored by joint stabilization of the thumb, associated with activation of the Flexor Pollicis Longus and Extensor Pollicis Longus by means of tenodesis or tendinous transfers.",1993,Annales de chirurgie plastique et esthetique
Editorial: The Inequality Crisis,"""Zero hunger"" was the message oflnacio Lula da Silva, an eminent trade unionist, when he was elected President of Brazil in 2002. At the time, people throughout Latin America were starting to vote for political leaders concerned about economic inequality. Today, the ripples of this wave seem to have reached, at last, the centre of global finance:New York has faced fiscal collapse, a crime epidemic, terrorist attacks, and natural disasters. But now, in our time, we face a different crisis - an inequality crisis. It's not often the stuff of banner headlines in our daily newspapers. It's a quiet crisis, but one no less pernicious than those that have come before. Its urgency is read on the faces of our neighbours and their children, as families struggle to make it against increasingly long odds (de Blasio, 2014).These words represent the centrepiece of the inaugural address of the new Mayor of New York, Bill de Blasio, in January 2014. A few weeks earlier, de Blasio had won the mayoral elections in a landslide, gaining 73 per cent of the vote with a campaign that focused on economic inequality, poverty and other social issues. He succeeds Michael Bloomberg, a business magnate and one of the richest people in the world, who stood for a free market approach to urban politics.Undoubtedly, de Blasio s campaign was about New York, not about the United States or the state of the world. But as the attention paid to his victory by international news media indicates, his observation that there is an ""inequality crisis"" has a significance that goes beyond the city limits of New York. In fact, income inequality has increased considerably in the last decades, in almost all OECD countries and emerging economies. According to a recent report by the NGO Oxfam, the 85 wealthiest people on the planet own as much as the poorest half of the global population (Fuentes-Nieva and Galasso, 2014). As the contributions to this issue demonstrate, this rise in inequality is connected to the advance of free market strategies in economic policy across the globe from the 1970s onwards and, more recently, to the prevalence of modes of managing the global financial and economic crisis that protect asset owners and hit hard people on low incomes.The Combating Inequality Research ProjectThis issue of the Journal assembles work from the Combating Inequality Research Project of the Global Labour University (GLU). The GLU is a network of higher education and research institutions in Brazil (University of Campinas), Germany (University of Kassel and Berlin School of Economics and Law), India (Tata Institute of Social Sciences) and South Africa (University of the Witwatersrand). At these campuses, Master s degree courses are being offered for trade unionists from across the globe. The project was launched in early 2013 and is the GLU s first major undertaking in the field of research, funded by the Hans Bockler Foundation.The inequality project starts from the premise that trade unions represent people who are negatively affected by the rise in global inequality, and that they have a strong track record of fighting inequality. In this context, the project asks how unions could respond to the ""inequality crisis"", that is, what could be useful political demands to be voiced by unions in this context, and what they could do to mobilize around this issue. It examines the causes of economic inequality, charts its development in the last few decades, assesses countermeasures and discusses strategies for their implementation, and identifies supportive social forces.1This issue can be seen as a mid-term report on the inequality project. With the exception of Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett, all the contributors are directly involved with it and present interim research findings. These represent the six thematic areas of the project, namely, labour markets and macroeconomic governance; the financial system; redistribution policies; conceptions of sustainable development; countermeasures; and implementation strategies and campaigns. â€¦",2014,
Structure of an antibacterial peptide ATP-binding cassette transporter in a novel outward occluded state.,"Enterobacteriaceae produce antimicrobial peptides for survival under nutrient starvation. Microcin J25 (MccJ25) is an antimicrobial peptide with a unique lasso topology. It is secreted by the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) exporter McjD, which ensures self-immunity of the producing strain through efficient export of the toxic mature peptide from the cell. Here we have determined the crystal structure of McjD from Escherichia coli at 2.7-Ã… resolution, which is to the authors' knowledge the first structure of an antibacterial peptide ABC transporter. Our functional and biochemical analyses demonstrate McjD-dependent immunity to MccJ25 through efflux of the peptide. McjD can directly bind MccJ25 and displays a basal ATPase activity that is stimulated by MccJ25 in both detergent solution and proteoliposomes. McjD adopts a new conformation, termed nucleotide-bound outward occluded. The new conformation defines a clear cavity; mutagenesis and ligand binding studies of the cavity have identified Phe86, Asn134, and Asn302 as important for recognition of MccJ25. Comparisons with the inward-open MsbA and outward-open Sav1866 structures show that McjD has structural similarities with both states without the intertwining of transmembrane (TM) helices. The occluded state is formed by rotation of TMs 1 and 2 toward the equivalent TMs of the opposite monomer, unlike Sav1866 where they intertwine with TMs 3-6 of the opposite monomer. Cysteine cross-linking studies on the McjD dimer in inside-out membrane vesicles of E. coli confirmed the presence of the occluded state. We therefore propose that the outward-occluded state represents a transition intermediate between the outward-open and inward-open conformation of ABC exporters.",2014,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
Graphical user interface (GUI) for the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression,"In Data Science, we usually encounter High-dimensional data. In this situation, the Classical Regression method usually cannot perform well because it is impossible to include all covariates in the model since the number of a parameter to be estimated is larger than the sample size. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) method is one of the methods which can deal with this problem. Lasso regression perform the selection of covariates so that only the most influential covariates are used in the model. Unfortunately, most of Lasso method should be performed in CLI Software which is difficult to use for the general user. For this reason, we develop a web application by using Shiny to perform the Lasso method based on GUI which is easier to use. It allows users to analyze high-dimensional data without using programming language. The paper contains an implementation of Lasso Regression using web application on olive pomade oil data.",2019,
A hybrid data mining approach for identifying the temporal effects of variables associated with breast cancer survival,"Abstract Predicting breast cancer survival is crucial for practitioners to determine possible outcomes and make better treatment plans for the patients. In this study, a hybrid data mining based methodology was constructed to differentiate the variables whose importance for survival change over time. Therefore, the importance of variables was determined for three different time periods (i.e. one, five, and ten years). To conduct such an analysis, the most parsimonious models were constructed by employing one regression analysis methodâ€”Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), and one metaheuristic optimization method, namely a Genetic Algorithm (GA). Due to the high imbalance between the number of survivals and deaths, two well-known resampling proceduresâ€”Random Under-sampling (RUS) and Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE)â€”were applied to increase the performance of the classification models. In the final stage, two data mining models, namely Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Logistic Regression (LR), were utilized along with 10-fold cross-validation. Sensitivity analysis (SA) was conducted for each model to identify the importance of each variable for a certain model and time period. The obtained results revealed that certain variables lose their importance over time, while others gain importance. This information can assist medical practitioners in identifying specific subsets of variables to focus on in different periods, which will in turn lead to a more effective and efficient cancer care. Moreover, the study findings indicate that extremely parsimonious models can be developed by adopting a purely data-driven approach, rather than eliminating the variables manually. Such methodology can also be applied in treating other types of cancer.",2020,Expert Syst. Appl.
Semi-supervised Classification using Kernel Entropy Component Analysis and the LASSO.,"In this thesis we present a new semi-supervised classification technique based on the Kernel Entropy Component Analysis (KECA) transformation and the least absolute shrinkage selection operator (LASSO). The latter is a constrained version of the least squares classifier. Traditional supervised classification techniques only use a limited set of labeled data to train the classifier, thus leaving a large part of the data practically unused. If we have very little training data available it is obvious that the classifier will have problems generalizing well as too few points will not fully represent the classes we are training the classifier to separate. So creating semi-supervised classifiers that somehow includes information from unlabeled data is a natural extension. This is further confirmed by the fact that labeling of data is very often a boring and time consuming task that can only be done by a few experts on the field in question rather than general pattern recognition experts, while unlabeled data are often abundant and no experts are needed. One way of taking advantage of unlabeled data, which is the one we will use in this thesis, is to first transform the data to a new space using all data, both labeled and unlabeled, and in this new space use the labeled points to create a classifier. The idea is that when we include all the unlabeled data in the transformation the, often scarcely populated, labeled data set will represent the data better than without the unlabeled points. Previous work have shown very good results using the data transformations Laplacian eigenmaps with ordinary least squares and Data Spectroscopy with the LASSO. We transform the data with a new method developed at the University of TromsÃ¸ called Kernel Entropy Component Analysis and combine it with LASSO classification.

Development of a predictive radiomics model for lymph node metastases in pre-surgical CT-based stage IA non-small cell lung cancer.,"OBJECTIVES
To develop and validate predictive models using clinical parameters, radiomic features and a combination of both for lymph node metastasis (LNM) in pre-surgical CT-based stage IA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.


METHODS
This retrospective study included 649 pre-surgical CT-based stage IA NSCLC patients from our hospital. One hundred and thirty-eight (21 %) of the 649 patients had LNM after surgery. A total of 396 radiomic features were extracted from the venous phase contrast enhanced computed tomography (CECT). The training group included 455 patients (97 with and 358 without LNM) and the testing group included 194 patients (41 with and 153 without LNM). The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm was used for radiomic feature selection. The random forest (RF) was used for model development. Three models (a clinical model, a radiomics model, and a combined model) were developed to predict LNM in early stage NSCLC patients. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) value and decision curve analysis were used to evaluate the performance in LNM status (with or without LNM) using the three models.


RESULTS
The ROC analysis (also decision curve analysis) showed predictive performance for LNM of the radiomics model (AUC values for training and testing, respectively 0.898 and 0.851) and of the combined model (0.911 and 0.860, respectively). Both performed better than the clinical model (0.739 and 0.614, respectively; delong test p-values both<0.001).


CONCLUSION
A radiomics model using the venous phase of CE-CT has potential for predicting LNM in pre-surgical CT-based stage IA NSCLC patients.",2019,Lung cancer
A CpG Methylation Classifier to Predict Relapse in Adults with T-cell Lymphoblastic Lymphoma.,"PURPOSE
Adults with T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) generally benefit from treatment with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)-like regimens, but approximately 40% will relapse after such treatment. We evaluated the value of CpG methylation in predicting relapse for adults with T-LBL treated with ALL-like regimens.


EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
A total of 549 adults with T-LBL from 27 medical centers were included in the analysis. Using the Illumina Methylation 850K Beadchip, 44 relapse-related CpGs were identified from 49 T-LBL samples by two algorithms, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selector Operation (LASSO) and Support Vector Machine-Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE). We built a four-CpG classifier using LASSO Cox regression based on association between the methylation level of CpGs and relapse-free survival (RFS) in the training cohort (n=160).The four-CpG classifier was validated in the internal testing cohort (n=68) and independent validation cohort (n=321) Results: The four-CpG-based classifier discriminated T-LBL patients at high risk of relapse in the training cohort from those at low risk (p<0.001).This classifier also showed good predictive value in the internal testing cohort (p<0.001) and the independent validation cohort(p<0.001). A nomogram incorporating 5 independent prognostic factors including the CpG-based classifier, lactate dehydrogenase levels, ECOG-PS, central nervous system involvement and NOTCH1/FBXW7 status showed a significantly higher predictive accuracy than each single variable. Stratification into different subgroups by the nomogram helped identify the subset of patients who most benefited from more intensive chemotherapy and/or sequential hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.


CONCLUSIONS
Our four-CpG-based classifier could predict disease relapse in patients with T-LBL, and could be used to guide treatment decision.",2020,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research
C-HiLasso: A Collaborative Hierarchical Sparse Modeling Framework,"Sparse modeling is a powerful framework for data analysis and processing. Traditionally, encoding in this framework is performed by solving an l1-regularized linear regression problem, commonly referred to as Lasso or Basis Pursuit. In this work we combine the sparsity-inducing property of the Lasso at the individual feature level, with the block-sparsity property of the Group Lasso, where sparse groups of features are jointly encoded, obtaining a sparsity pattern hierarchically structured. This results in the Hierarchical Lasso (HiLasso), which shows important practical advantages. We then extend this approach to the collaborative case, where a set of simultaneously coded signals share the same sparsity pattern at the higher (group) level, but not necessarily at the lower (inside the group) level, obtaining the collaborative HiLasso model (C-HiLasso). Such signals then share the same active groups, or classes, but not necessarily the same active set. This model is very well suited for applications such as source identification and separation. An efficient optimization procedure, which guarantees convergence to the global optimum, is developed for these new models. The underlying presentation of the framework and optimization approach is complemented by experimental examples and theoretical results regarding recovery guarantees.",2011,IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing
Does Corporate Governance Impact Bank Performance? -evidence from India,"The purpose of this paper is to examine whether corporate governance (CG)mechanisms of Indian banks affect their financial performance. This study employs panel data models for a sample of 29 Indian banks that form part of the National Stock Exchange 500 index(NSE-500 Index) for the period 2009-2016.Ten board characteristics are considered as the proxy for CG of banks.Return on Assets(ROA) is assumed to be a proxy for financial performance of banks. Our work concludes that only one out of ten board characteristics , namely number of board members positively affects accounting performance of Indian banks (measured through return on assets). This study looks at a sample of twenty nine Indian banks over a period of eight years only ,the findings of the study may differ ,if different time period is considered .Further other corporate governance mechanisms such as characteristics of audit committee,stakeholder relations committee,nomination and remuneration committee and risk management committee are not considered for th e study. This paper adds to the domain of corporate governance by introducing a new measure for corporate governance of banks which is constructed by collecting the relevant data from the annual reports of the sample banks.Academia,hereafter, may employ the identified board related variables, as the proxy for CG of the banks.Further, managers of banks may improve their performance by taking cognizance of those board related parameters, which have an impact on their performance. To the best of the knowledge of the authors, no study in the literature has investigated the impact of CG on the performance of banks in India.Hence, the findings of the study has major implications both for academia and managers. KeywordsCorporate Governance, Bank Performance, Board characteristics, Indian Banks INTRODUCTION Corporate Governance(CG) deals with the mechanisms, through which providers of capital and other stakeholders, control the managerial actions such that managers are motivated to maximize the wellbeing of the various stakeholders of the firm (Clarke,1998;Cooper & Owen, 2007).Corporate governance is the system used to delineate the rights and responsibilities of the board ,management ,shareholders, and other stakeholders in a firm(Dong et al., 2017).The positive impact of corporate governance on the performance of the firms is documented by extant literature. For instance effective corporate governance results in higher profitability (Miwa,2002; Orbay & Yurtoglu,2006;Balasubramanian et al.,2010;Yasser,2011; Francis et al.,2013;Ararat et al. 2017), lower cost of capital (Anderson et al. ,2004;Ghouma et al. 2017), increased firm value (Klein et al.,2004;Setia-Atmaja,2009; Cheung et al.,2011; Conelly et al.,2012;Nini et al., 2012), enhanced market liquidity(Prommin et al.,2014;Elshandidy & Neri, 2015), increased access to the credit market (Stulz,1999 &Funchal & MonteMor, 2016), better capital structure choice(Jiraporn et al. 2012), reduced information asymmetry(Healy & Palepu,2001 ;Cormier etal.,2009 ;Dass & Massa, 2011), minimized managerial entrenchment (Anderson et al.,2004;Morellec et al.,2012),reduced default risk(Switzer,2013 ; Calomiris,2016), higher research and development investment (Zhang et al.,2014 & Chen,2014), better crisis management(Essen et al.,2013 & Villanueva-Villar,2016), and increased dividend payout (Pinkowitz et al.,2006& Harford et al., 2008). Regulation and competitiveness have a role in shaping corporate governance mechanisms (Udayasankar & Das,2007 &Claessens & Yurtoglu, 2013) .Whereas in U.S. ,the Sarbanes Oxley Act lays down, a set of mandatory rules and regulations concerning the governance norms ,other countries such as UK ,have framed voluntary guidelines(Bruno&Claessens,2010& Zalewska,2014).The Cadbury report lays down, a set of procedures for the appointment of directors to the board, who are responsible for the firmâ€™s control and governance mechanisms(Brown et al. ,2011). Amongst the developing countries, particularly in India, the CG reform process started as a response to scandals in equity markets , and firms disappearing with equity market participantsâ€™ wealth(Narayanaswamy et al., 2012).The Securities and Exchanges Board of India(SEBI) was set up as a statutory body, in order to protect the well-being of minority shareholders (Singh,2015). In 2000 ,the Kumar Mangalam committee formed by SEBI ,submitted its proposals pertaining to CG (Deb, 2013).This led to the clause 49 being introduced with regulations pertaining to shareholder rights ,management and discussion analysis, board procedures, as well as board composition norms (Kumar & Singh, 2012).The Narayanamurthy committee lays down ,the rules for handling of independent directors sitting on the board(Kumar & Singh,2012). With respect to risk management strategies, the committee lays down the norms for supervision ,by the board ,and its norms also dealt with disclosure, and audit standards (Narayanaswamy et al., 2012).Sound corporate governance is believed to be related with an appropriate level of corporate monitoring ,and corporate performance(Cadbury,1997;Helmers,2017).Banks are increasingly being seen as opaque (Lassoued,2016), and operating in a complex, and regulated environment(Andres & Vallellado,2008;Mehran et al. 2011). In developed countries,bank efficiency ( a quick and convenient way of bankâ€™s ability to turn resources into revenue)is assumed to Â© 2018 JETIR August 2018, Volume 5, Issue 8 www.jetir.org (ISSN-2349-5162) JETIRA006124 Journal of Emerging Technologies and Innovative Research (JETIR) www.jetir.org 697 be a proxy for quality of financial development (Koetter& Wedow,2010;Greenwood,2013).An understanding of corporate governance ,has an impact on the financial performance, as well as asset quality of banks(Augusto,2016). Few studies, have examined the performance of banking sector in developing economies(Tecles & Tabak, 2010). Corporate governance of these institutions is an important issue, keeping in mind the essential role that banks play in emerging economies, and the nature of the banking reforms that these economies have implemented (Deb, 2013).To the best of the knowledge of the researchers, no study has been undertaken with an objective of measuring the impact of corporate governance on performance of banks operating in India. The research questions that come to the fore are: Whether corporate governance affects the accounting performance of Indian banks? , and Hence,the paper has the following objectives: 1)To introduce a new measure of corporate governance based on tenboard characteristics using data reported by sample Indian banks in their annual reports. 2) To empirically investigate the impact of corporate governance on the accounting performance of Indian banks (measured through return on assets). This work introduces a new measure of corporate governance, which attempts to measure corporate governance using, data collected from the annual reports of Indian banks. Managers can improve the performance of banks, by taking cognizance of the relationship between board indicators, and financial performance of their banks. This study is based on data related to corporate governance, and accounting measure of performance of twenty nine Indian listed banks. Data is collected for eight financial years (2009-2016) using annual reports of the sample banks and CMIE Prowess, the database of Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy. The study concludes that, the corporate governance of Indian banks has a positive and significant impact on their accounting, and market performance. The uniqueness of the study is that it develops a new corporate governance measure,using CG reports disclosed by the sample banks in their annual reports. The remainder of the study is organized as follows: the second section deals with the literature review and the development of the theoretical framework. The third section presents the methodology conveying information about the sample selection, variables used and the model specification. Analysis and discussion of the results are presented in the fourth section. The fifth section concludes the study,and spells out the scope for further research. LITERATURE REVIEW Corporate governance affects investment ,financing (Morellec et al., 2012),and dividend pay-outdecisions(Officer, 2011). Several previous studies (Fauver et al., 2006;Beltratti & Stulz, 2012), have shown that good corporate governance practices improve organizational performance under stable economic conditions. Board characteristics, are considered to be a proxy for corporate governance(Boone et al,2007;Andres&Vallelado,2008).Early work on boards, by Smith (1776) and Berle& Means(1932) suggests that, directors are unable to monitor shareholder wealth. The board of a company is entrusted with the duty of monitoring the performance of the firm, on behalf of the shareholders(Acharya et al.,2011).Erickson et al, (2006) quotes that a â€œwell constituted board with an optimum number of directors, can be effective in monitoring the management, and driving value enhancement for shareholdersâ€. It is the fiduciary responsibility of the board to advise managers on a regular basis, though in practice it is often ignored by the corporate board(Barroso et al. 2011). The monitoring function of the board is intended to address the agency problem between managers and shareholders (Tuggle,2010) ,whereas the advising function refers to helping management with strategic initiatives (Faleye et al. ,2011). Financial system is aided by a set of intermediaries, who contribute to the functioning, and growth of markets (Levine, 2004).As per the modern theory of financial intermediation, liquidity creation is an essential role of banks(Berger & Bouwman, 2009;Fungacova,2013). Banks are a special set of intermediaries as not everyone can sell, and distribute financial products(Beck, 2001).In countries with poor governance, the role of ba",2018,Journal of emerging technologies and innovative research
Robust Classification by Pre-conditioned LASSO and Transductive Diffusion Component Analysis,"Modern machine learning-based recognition approaches require large-scale datasets with large number of labelled training images. However, such datasets are inherently difficult and costly to collect and annotate. Hence there is a great and growing interest in automatic dataset collection methods that can leverage the web. Collecting datasets in this way, however, requires robust and efficient ways for detecting and excluding outliers that are common and prevalent. So far, there have been a limited effort in machine learning community to directly detect outliers for robust classification. Inspired by the recent work on Pre-conditioned LASSO, this paper formulates the outlier detection task using Pre-conditioned LASSO and employs unsupervised transductive diffusion component analysis to both integrate the topological structure of the data manifold, from labeled and unlabeled instances, and reduce the feature dimensionality. Synthetic experiments as well as results on two real-world classification tasks show that our framework can robustly detect the outliers and improve classification.",2015,ArXiv
"Early Toarcian (Jurassic) belemnites from northeastern Gondwana (South Riffian ridges, Morocco)","AbstractA belemnite fauna collected in the lowermost Toarcian succession that crops out near Moulay Idriss (northern Morocco) is studied in this article. This is the first palaeontological study of Early Toarcian belemnites from Northern Africa, i.e., the northeastern margin of the Gondwana, in connexion with Tethys. Four species of the family Passaloteuthidae Naef, 1922, have been identified: Passaloteuthis bisulcata (de Blainville, 1827), Pseudohastites longiformis (Blake, 1876), Parapassaloteuthis zieteni (Mayer-Eymar, 1884) and Parapassaloteuthis sp. A. All species have been collected in lowermost Toarcian beds dated to the ammonite Polymorphum Chronozone (=Tenuicostatum Chronozone), which coincides with the belemnite Passaloteuthis bisulcata biozone. 
The discovery of a syntype of this zonal index is discussed. The identified species are common with Europe, thus suggesting that the onset of the belemnite provincialism in the Toarcian could post-date the earliest Toarcian Polymorphumâ€”Tenuicostatum Chronozone. However, records of Early Jurassic belemnites are still too sparse to recognize the establishment of provincialism and the timing of its onset.KurzfassungAus der untersten Toarcium-Abfolge in der NÃ¤he von Moulay Idriss (Nord-Marokko) wird eine Belemnitenfauna beschrieben.

l1-Regularization of High-Dimensional Time-Series Models with Flexible Innovations,"We study the asymptotic properties of the Adaptive LASSO (adaLASSO) in sparse, high-dimensional, linear time-series models. We assume that both the number of covariates in the model and the number of candidate variables can increase with the sample size (polynomially orgeometrically). In other words, we let the number of candidate variables to be larger than the number of observations. We show the adaLASSO consistently chooses the relevant variables as the number of observations increases (model selection consistency) and has the oracle property, even when the errors are non-Gaussian and conditionally heteroskedastic. This allows the adaLASSO to be applied to a myriad of applications in empirical finance and macroeconomics. A simulation study shows that the method performs well in very general settings with t-distributed and heteroskedastic errors as well with highly correlated regressors. Finally, we consider an application to forecast monthly US inflation with many predictors. The model estimated by the adaLASSO delivers superior forecasts than traditional benchmark competitors such as autoregressive and factor models.",2015,
Parasite-Derived Proteins Inhibit Allergic Specific Th2 Response,"The prevalence of allergic disease and asthma has increased dramatically during the last 30-40 years. Atopic disorders comprise a range of allergic diseases including asthma, anaphylaxis, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis; these diseases have been seen a precipitous increase in the last four decades. Intriguingly, geographic regions with a high helminth infection burden tend to have a lower incidence of asthma (1). The effects of parasitic infections on the incidence of allergic disease has been receiving increased attention from researchers of late, with studies conducted in Ethiopia and Gabon demonstrating that parasitic infestation is associated with reduced atopic sensitization and dust mite skin test sensitivity (2-4). Children treated repeatedly for Trichuris trichiura and Ascaris lumbricoides exhibited increased dust-mite skin responses as compared with children that had not been treated for asymptomatic soilassociated helminthic infections (5). Several molecules from helminthes induce pronounced Th2 responses in a manner similar to that seen in cases of full-blown parasitic infection. Excretory-secretory (ES) glycoproteins isolated from the rodent nematode, Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, have been shown to evidence Th2-promoting activity on dendrite cells, however, the exact nature of the molecules involved in N. brasiliensis ES proteins remain to be clearly elucidated. This activity is heat-labile and protease-sensitive, thereby suggesting that the active component is proteinaceous in nature (6). Also, in schistosomiasis, the soluble extract of Schistosoma mansoni eggs (SEA) was shown to induce SEA-specific Th2 responses when injected into mice (7), and SEA was also demonstrated to condition human dendrite cells (DCs) to polarize Th response in a Th2 direction in vitro (8). When exposed to Th2 cytokines, these molecules can also activate host CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T cells (regulatory T cells, Treg) which subsequently release IL-10 and tumor growth factor Î² (TGF-Î²), which may be functionally involved in the suppression of the level of Th2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13. These parasites can establish a chronic infection, which highlights important issues (9), in that the presence of these metabolically active pathogens indicates that the immune system is being relentlessly challenged with foreign antigens; this continuous immune reactivity, if uncontrolled, could eventuate severe pathology. In addition, these pathogens may have developed evolutionary strategies by which they may evade the immune system for long-term survival in an immunocompetent host (10). In order to ascertain, then, whether parasitic infections can reduce allergic reactions and whether their infective stage influences the immune system of the host, we have mimicked",2012,
Machine Learning on High Dimensional Shape Data from Subcortical Brain Surfaces: A Comparison of Feature Selection and Classification Methods,"Recently, high-dimensional shape data HDSD has been demonstrated to be informative in describing subcortical brain morphometry in several disorders. While HDSD may serve as a biomarker of disease, its high dimensionality may require careful treatment in its application to machine learning. Here, we compare several possible approaches for feature selection and pattern classification using HDSD. We explore the efficacy of three candidate feature selection FS methods: Guided Random Forest GRF, LASSO and no feature selection NFS. Each feature set was applied to three classifiers: Random Forest RF, Support Vector Machines SVM and Naive Bayes NB. Each model was cross-validated using two diagnostic contrasts: Alzheimer's Disease and mild cognitive impairment; each relative to matched controls. GRF and NFS outperformed LASSO as FS methods and were comparably competitive. NB underperformed relative to RF and SVM, which were comparable in performance. Our results advocate the NFS-RF approach for its speed, simplicity and interpretability.",2015,

"Community Structure of Eastern Pacific Reef Fishes (Gulf of Papagayo, Costa Rica)","We assessed the relative abundance of reef fishes and its relation with physical parameters and habitat at four sites in Culebra Bay, a human disturbed area in Gulf of Papagayo, Costa Rica (eastern Pacitic) fiom March to October 1997. Based on 64 visual counts, we recorded 75 species of 28 M e s of reef fishes. Four pomacentrids, two labrids and one haemulid comprised the top seven most abundant species, ranked as follows: Chromis atrilobata, Tholassoma lucasanum, Abudefd$ troschelzz, Haemulon steindachneri, Halichoeres dzspilus, Stegastes acapulcoensis, and Sfegastesf7milafus. Densities of many of the species vaned significantly with variable site depth. Our results reflect higher Beta diversity than other studies, altough only 22% of the species were found at all the study sites. The type of substrate, the complexity, and the exposure of the reef may have a strong iduence on the distniution of many of the species of reef fishes in the Gulf of Papagayo. Four possible groups of fish species were observed suggesting that spatial patterns were stronger than seasonal trends. The shallowest site was c h m r i z e d by Ophioblennius sterndachneri, Microspathodon bazrdii, M. dorsalis and Abudefduf troschelii. An intermediate site with a more heterogeneons substrate, was composed by S. acapulcoensis, Canthigaster pmctatisszma, H nicholsi, H. chimchiae, T. lucasanum, Sgamen verres and Serranus psittacmus. A slightly deeper site than the previous was represented by H. dzspzlus, Johnranddia nigrirostris, Pomacanthus zonpecfus, Holacanthus passer, and S. flavilatus. Fially the deepest site habitat, had a distinctive assemblage composed by C. atrilobata, Chaetodon Tecnociencia, Vol. 7, No 2 humeralis, Diodon holocanthus, H. steindachneri, and H. maculicauda.

"Thalassodendron ciliatum (Cymodoceaceae) in Palau: occurrence, typhoon impacts and changes over time","Abstract The seagrass Thalassodendron ciliatum (Cymodoceaceae) is uncommon in Palau, Micronesia, but remnant beds occur in an area of less than 1 km2 on the northern tip of Velasco Reef, a sunken atoll, plus small areas on its western rim. The ridges are lengthy, consisting of rhizome mat and seagrass up to 1 m high, and 4â€“8 m wide forming curving elongate shapes (arcs, concentric curves, circles, patches). Most occur on a gently sloping limestone bottom 22â€“27 m deep, with some as shallow as 15 m on the Western Rim, and ridges sit directly on top of the limestone pavement, with only the weight of mat and its incorporated rock materials holding them in place. Photographic monitoring over time has indicated they are actively eroding on their edges, but the passage of Super Typhoon Haiyan in 2013 caused much greater damage to the beds. Small patches occur in shallow water on the east side of Babeldaob Island slightly behind the fringing reef crest and have not changed significantly over recent decades.",2018,Botanica Marina
"Sexual Phenotype Differences in zic2 mRNA Abundance in the Preoptic Area of a Protogynous Teleost, Thalassoma bifasciatum","The highly conserved members of the zic family of zinc-finger transcription factors are primarily known for their roles in embryonic signaling pathways and regulation of cellular proliferation and differentiation. This study describes sexual phenotype differences in abundances of zic2 mRNA in the preoptic area of the hypothalamus, a region strongly implicated in sexual behavior and function, in an adult teleost, Thalassoma bifasciatum. The bluehead wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum) is a valuable model for studying neuroendocrine processes because it displays two discrete male phenotypes, initial phase (IP) males and territorial, terminal phase (TP) males, and undergoes socially-controlled protogynous sex change. Previously generated microarray-based comparisons suggested that zic2 was upregulated in the brains of terminal phase males relative to initial phase males. To further explore this difference, we cloned a 727 bp sequence for neural zic2 from field-collected animals. Riboprobe-based in situ hybridization was employed to localize zic2 signal in adult bluehead brains and assess the relative abundance of brain zic2 mRNA across sexual phenotypes. We found zic2 mRNA expression was extremely abundant in the granular cells of the cerebellum and widespread in other brain regions including in the thalamus, hypothalamus, habenula, torus semicircularis, torus longitudinalis, medial longitudinal fascicle and telencephalic areas. Quantitative autoradiography and phosphorimaging showed zic2 mRNA hybridization signal in the preoptic area of the hypothalamus was significantly higher in terminal phase males relative to both initial phase males and females, and silver grain analysis confirmed this relationship between phenotypes. No significant difference in abundance was found in zic2 signal across phenotypes in the habenula, a brain region not implicated in the control of sexual behavior, or cerebellum.",2011,PLoS ONE
Aspects Related to Body Image and Eating Behaviors in Healthy Brazilian Undergraduate Students,"The discrepancy between oneâ€™s actual body and the ideal body, especially among young adults, can lead to body dissatisfaction in both men and women, which is commonly accepted to be central to eating disorders. We explored aspects of body image and eating disorders in healthy Brazilian students (n = 219) using two standardized measures (Body Shape Questionnaire [BSQ-34] and Eating Attitudes Test [EAT-26]) and assessing height, weight, Body Mass Index (BMI), and the history of physical activity. We also analyzed the ability of one measure to predict another. Linear multiple regression was used to verify which variables best predicted the scale outcomes. The Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) was used for variable selection. The results suggested that women have a greater risk of body dissatisfaction and eating disorders. Both instruments had variables that significantly predicted each otherâ€™s results, whereas BMI was only associated with BSQ-34 scores. These findings broaden our understanding of eating disorders and body image.",2018,
Portfolio Optimization with Return Prediction Models Evidence for Industry Portfolios,"Several studies suggest that using prediction models instead of historical averages results in more efficient asset allocations, thus providing investors with higher risk-adjusted returns. While earlier studies focus on predicting the U.S. equity market risk-premium, we investigate the predictability of industry returns and hypothesize that forecasting returns on the industry level rather than on the aggregate stock market level allows for superior asset allocation decisions. Moreover, we extend the commonly tested dataset of predictive variables by including additional macro variables, reflecting the business cycle and technical indicators using information on investor behavior. We analyze industry return forecasts in-sample and out-ofsample and evaluate the economic benefits of industry level predictions in an asset allocation framework based on the Black-Litterman model. We first analyze the predictive power of individual variables using bivariate regressions and then examine multivariate predictive regression models including OLS, a regularization technique (LASSO), predictive regressions based on principal components, a target-relevant latent factor approach (3PRF), as well as forecast combinations. Our results suggest that return forecast models predict future returns better than historical averages for most industries. Moreover, our results reveal that asset allocations based on return predictions significantly outperform asset allocations based on historical averages as well as passive equally weighted (1/N) portfolios. Most importantly, using industry return predictions results in more efficient asset allocation decisions providing investors with higher risk-adjusted returns.",2015,

Iteratively reweighted LASSO for mapping multiple quantitative trait loci,"The iteratively reweighted least square (IRLS) method is mostly identical to maximum likelihood (ML) method in terms of parameter estimation and power of quantitative trait locus (QTL) detection. But the IRLS is greatly superior to ML in terms of computing speed and the robustness of parameter estimation. In conjunction with the priors of parameters, ML can analyze multiple QTL model based on Bayesian theory, whereas under a single QTL model, IRLS has very limited statistical power to detect multiple QTLs. In this study, we proposed the iteratively reweighted least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (IRLASSO) for extending IRLS to simultaneously map multiple QTLs. The LASSO with coordinate descent step is employed to efficiently estimate non-zero genetic effect of each locus scanned over entire genome. Simulations demonstrate that IRLASSO has a higher precision of parameter estimation and power to detect QTL than IRLS, and is able to estimate residual variance more accurately than the unweighted LASSO based on LS. Especially, IRLASSO is very fast, usually taking less than five iterations to converge. The barley dataset from the North American Barley Genome Mapping Project is reanalyzed by our proposed method.",2014,Briefings in bioinformatics
Multidimensional Shrinkage-Thresholding Operator and Group LASSO Penalties,"The scalar shrinkage-thresholding operator is a key ingredient in variable selection algorithms arising in wavelet denoising, JPEG2000 image compression and predictive analysis of gene microarray data. In these applications, the decision to select a scalar variable is given as the solution to a scalar sparsity penalized quadratic optimization. In some other applications, one seeks to select multidimensional variables. In this work, we present a natural multidimensional extension of the scalar shrinkage thresholding operator. Similarly to the scalar case, the threshold is determined by the minimization of a convex quadratic form plus an Euclidean norm penalty, however, here the optimization is performed over a domain of dimension N â‰¥ 1. The solution to this convex optimization problem is called the multidimensional shrinkage threshold operator (MSTO). The MSTO reduces to the scalar case in the special case of N=1. In the general case of N >; 1 the optimal MSTO shrinkage can be found through a simple convex line search. We give an efficient algorithm for solving this line search and show that our method to evaluate the MSTO outperforms other state-of-the art optimization approaches. We present several illustrative applications of the MSTO in the context of Group LASSO penalized estimation.",2011,IEEE Signal Processing Letters

Ridle for sparse regression with mandatory covariates with application to the genetic assessment of histologic grades of breast cancer,"BackgroundMany questions in statistical genomics can be formulated in terms of variable selection of candidate biological factors for modeling a trait or quantity of interest. Often, in these applications, additional covariates describing clinical, demographical or experimental effects must be included a priori as mandatory covariates while allowing the selection of a large number of candidate or optional variables. As genomic studies routinely require mandatory covariates, it is of interest to propose principled methods of variable selection that can incorporate mandatory covariates.MethodsIn this article, we propose the ridge-lasso hybrid estimator (ridle), a new penalized regression method that simultaneously estimates coefficients of mandatory covariates while allowing selection for others. The ridle provides a principled approach to mitigate effects of multicollinearity among the mandatory covariates and possible dependency between mandatory and optional variables. We provide detailed empirical and theoretical studies to evaluate our method. In addition, we develop an efficient algorithm for the ridle. Software, based on efficient Fortran code with R-language wrappers, is publicly and freely available at https://sites.google.com/site/zhongyindaye/software.ResultsThe ridle is useful when mandatory predictors are known to be significant due to prior knowledge or must be kept for additional analysis. Both theoretical and comprehensive simulation studies have shown that the ridle to be advantageous when mandatory covariates are correlated with the irrelevant optional predictors or are highly correlated among themselves. A microarray gene expression analysis of the histologic grades of breast cancer has identified 24 genes, in which 2 genes are selected only by the ridle among current methods and found to be associated with tumor grade.ConclusionsIn this article, we proposed the ridle as a principled sparse regression method for the selection of optional variables while incorporating mandatory ones. Results suggest that the ridle is advantageous when mandatory covariates are correlated with the irrelevant optional predictors or are highly correlated among themselves.",2017,BMC Medical Research Methodology
Variable Clustering in High Dimensional Probit Regression,"Dimension reduction is a major issue in high-dimensional regression models. We recently introduced the CLusterwise Effect REgression (CLERE) methodology [1] in the context of linear regression for variable clustering as a way of reducing the dimensionality.

This comparison achieved on both simulated and real data, revealed the good predictive performances of our method.",2014,
A message-passing receiver for BICM-OFDM over unknown clustered-sparse channels,"We propose a factor-graph-based approach to joint channel-estimation-and-decoding of bit-interleaved coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (BICM-OFDM). In contrast to existing designs, ours is capable of exploiting not only sparsity in sampled channel taps but also clustering among the large taps, behaviors which are known to manifest at larger communication bandwidths. In order to exploit these channel-tap structures, we adopt a two-state Gaussian mixture prior in conjunction with a Markov model on the hidden state. For loopy belief propagation, we exploit a â€œgeneralized approximate message passingâ€ algorithm recently developed in the context of compressed sensing, and show that it can be successfully coupled with soft-input soft-output decoding, as well as hidden Markov inference. For N subcarriers and M bits per subcarrier (and any channel length L < N), our scheme has a computational complexity of only O(N log 2 N+N2M). Numerical experiments using IEEE 802.15.4a channels show that our scheme yields BER performance within 1 dB of the known-channel bound and 4 dB better than decoupled channel-estimation-and-decoding via LASSO.",2011,
Mycobacterium bovis Prevalence in Humans Does Not Differ between Regions in Burkina Faso,"Background: In 1996, tuberculosis detection rate was higher in Oudalan (Sahel region) than in other provinces in Burkina Faso. Cattle breeding, a major activity of the local population, may favor exposure of humans to bovine tuberculosis. 
Objectives: (i) to isolate and identify M. bovis among new cases of tuberculosis with positive culture in the Sahel (Gorom-Gorom and Dori); the Center (Ouagadougou) and the Western (Bobo-Dioulasso) regions of the country; (ii) to investigate susceptibility of isolated strains to anti-tuberculosis. 
Methods: (i) collection of sputum from newly TB patients with a positive smear during a prospective study carried out in 1998 in the North, Central and Western region of the country and transferred at the Mycobacteriology Laboratory, (ii) optimization of operational procedures: (iii) mycobacteria strains's isolation on 3 different media (Loweinstein Jensen (LJ), LJ without glycerine and LJ supplemented with pyruvate; (iv) identification of the tuberculosis complex according to criteria such as: bacillus growth time, colony appearance, biochemical test results, bacilli growth with pyrazinamide or thiophene carboxylate hydrazide, or D-cycloserine; (v) performing antibiograms. 
Results: Among the isolated strains, M. bovis represented 6.2% (2/30) in Gorom-Gorom, 0% (0/18) in Dori, 2.6% (3/109) in Ouagadougou and 2.9% (2/65) in Bobo-Dioulasso. Sixty nine percent (31/45) of strains were susceptible to the main anti-tuberculosis drugs, 13 strains presented single or combined resistance and one strain was multidrug-resistant. 
Conclusion: We showed that M. bovis disease is prevalent in all the studied regions but at a relatively low rate. The transhumance of from the north to the west practiced by the breeders could explain why it was found M. bovis in a similar rate as in Ouagdougou and Bobo-Dioulasso where livestock activity is less intense than in Gorom-Gorom.",2017,Archives of Clinical Microbiology
A Network-based Comparison between Molecular Apocrine Breast Cancer Tumor and Basal and Luminal Tumors by Joint Graphical Lasso.,"Joint graphical lasso(JGL) approach is a Gaussian graphical model to estimate multiple graphical models corresponding to distinct but related groups. Molecular apocrine (MA) breast cancer tumor has similar characteristics to luminal and basal subtypes. Due to the relationship between MA tumor and two other subtypes, this paper investigates the similarities and differences between the MA genes association network and the ones corresponding to other tumors by taking advantageous of JGL properties. Two distinct JGL graphical models are applied to two sub-datasets including the gene expression information of the MA and the luminal tumors and also the MA and the basal tumors. Then, topological comparisons between the networks such as finding the shared edges are applied. In addition, several support vector machine (SVM) classification models are performed to assess the discriminating power of some critical nodes in the networks, like hub nodes, to discriminate the tumors sample. Applying the JGL approach prepares an appropriate tool to observe the networks of the MA tumor and other subtypes in one map. The results obtained by comparing the networks could be helpful to generate new insight about MA tumor for future studies.",2019,IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics

The toolbox is free, open-source and available for use with the MATLAB and R numerical platforms.",2016,arXiv: Computation
Sparse Recovery with Coherent Tight Frame via Analysis Dantzig Selector and Analysis LASSO,"This article considers recovery of signals that are sparse or approximately sparse in terms of a (possibly) highly overcomplete and coherent tight frame from undersampled data corrupted with additive noise. We show that the properly constrained $l_1$-analysis, called analysis Dantzig selector, stably recovers a signal which is nearly sparse in terms of a tight frame provided that the measurement matrix satisfies a restricted isometry property adapted to the tight frame. As a special case, we consider the Gaussian noise. Further, under a sparsity scenario, with high probability, the recovery error from noisy data is within a log-like factor of the minimax risk over the class of vectors which are at most $s$ sparse in terms of the tight frame. Similar results for the analysis LASSO are showed. 
The above two algorithms provide guarantees only for noise that is bounded or bounded with high probability (for example, Gaussian noise). However, when the underlying measurements are corrupted by sparse noise, these algorithms perform suboptimally. We demonstrate robust methods for reconstructing signals that are nearly sparse in terms of a tight frame in the presence of bounded noise combined with sparse noise. The analysis in this paper is based on the restricted isometry property adapted to a tight frame, which is a natural extension to the standard restricted isometry property.",2013,ArXiv
Sound fossils and speaking stones: Towards a mineral ontology of contemporary art,"Barikin provides a compelling analysis of the ways in which contemporary art can challenge distinctions between animate and inanimate materials. The chapter uses the figure of the â€˜sound fossilâ€™â€”a term that refers to the audible traces of the Big Bangâ€”as a provocation for addressing new materialisms in contemporary art. Drawing from art history and philosophy, Barikinâ€™s â€˜mineral ontologyâ€™ proposes an ethics of being in which the livingâ€“non-living binary may no longer apply. The argument primarily focuses on a long-duration project Making a Record (Diamond, Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald) by Melissa Dubbin and Aaron S.

Why Tourists Donâ€™t Visit Again?,"The population of tourists has grown rapidly with the development of social media. The rise of social media has changed the behaviors that passengers visit sightseeing spots. Online consumer reviews could be considered as the main channel for providing valuable information to consumers. Revisit intention could directly influence the future behavior of customers. Itâ€™s also one of the crucial factors that enhance the income growth of tourism. However, relatively few researchers focused on why passengers donâ€™t revisit directly. Therefore, this study will focus on the topic that why passengers didnâ€™t revisit again. Weâ€™ll use textual reviews of social media instead of questionnaire survey. And text mining and feature selection (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, LASSO) methods have been employed to identify the factors that affect passenger non-revisit intention. From the results, this study will provide some suggestions for the tourism industry to improve their service quality and increase their revisit intentions.",2018,2018 9th International Conference on Awareness Science and Technology (iCAST)

Validation of ART Calculator for Predicting the Number of Metaphase II Oocytes Required for Obtaining at Least One Euploid Blastocyst for Transfer in Couples Undergoing in vitro Fertilization/Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection,"This multicenter study evaluated the reliability of the recently published ART calculator for predicting the minimum number of metaphase II (MII) oocytes (MIImin) to obtain at least one euploid blastocyst in patients undergoing in vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI). We used clinical and embryonic retrospective data of 1,464 consecutive infertile couples who underwent IVF/ICSI with the intention to have preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy. The validation procedure followed a stepwise approach. Firstly, we assessed the distribution of euploid blastocysts per patient and found that it followed a negative binomial distribution. Secondly, we used generalized linear models and applied the Lasso procedureâ€“including MII oocytes to adjust the dataâ€“to select the factors predicting the response variable â€œeuploid blastocyst.â€ Third, a logistic regression modelâ€“fit to the binomial response euploid (yes/no) for each MII oocyteâ€“was built using the relevant factors. The observational unit was the â€œwomanâ€ whereas the response was the pair (m, n), where n is the number of retrieved MII oocytes and m the corresponding number of euploid blastocysts. The model was internally validated by randomly splitting the data into training and validation sets. The R-squares (~0.25) and the area under the ROC curve (~0.70) did not differ between the training and validation datasets. Fourth, mathematical equations and the calculated probabilities generated by the validation model were used to determine the MIImin required for obtaining at least one euploid blastocyst according to different success probabilities. Lastly, we compared the fittings generated by the validation model and the ART calculator and assessed the predictive value of the latter using the validation dataset. The fittings were sufficiently close for both the estimated probabilities of blastocyst euploid per MII oocyte (r = 0.91) and MIImin (r = 0.88). The ART calculator positive predictive values, i.e., the frequency of patients with at least one euploid blastocyst among those who achieved the estimated MIImin, were 84.8%, 87.5%, and 90.0% for 70%, 80%, and 90% predicted probabilities of success, respectively. The ART calculator effectively predicts the MIImin needed to achieve at least one euploid blastocyst in individual patients undergoing IVF/ICSI. The prediction tool might be used for counseling and planning IVF/ICSI treatments.",2019,Frontiers in Endocrinology

Stability Selection for Structured Variable Selection,"In variable or graph selection problems, finding a right-sized model or controlling the number of false positives is notoriously difficult. Recently, a meta-algorithm called Stability Selection was proposed that can provide reliable finite-sample control of the number of false positives. Its benefits were demonstrated when used in conjunction with the lasso and orthogonal matching pursuit algorithms. 
In this paper, we investigate the applicability of stability selection to structured selection algorithms: the group lasso and the structured input-output lasso. We find that using stability selection often increases the power of both algorithms, but that the presence of complex structure reduces the reliability of error control under stability selection. We give strategies for setting tuning parameters to obtain a good model size under stability selection, and highlight its strengths and weaknesses compared to competing methods screen and clean and cross-validation. We give guidelines about when to use which error control method.",2017,ArXiv
Gene selection with guided regularized random forest,"The regularized random forest (RRF) was recently proposed for feature selection by building only one ensemble. In RRF the features are evaluated on a part of the training data at each tree node. We derive an upper bound for the number of distinct Gini information gain values in a node, and show that many features can share the same information gain at a node with a small number of instances and a large number of features. Therefore, in a node with a small number of instances, RRF is likely to select a feature not strongly relevant. Here an enhanced RRF, referred to as the guided RRF (GRRF), is proposed. In GRRF, the importance scores from an ordinary random forest (RF) are used to guide the feature selection process in RRF. Experiments on 10 gene data sets show that the accuracy performance of GRRF is, in general, more robust than RRF when their parameters change. GRRF is computationally efficient, can select compact feature subsets, and has competitive accuracy performance, compared to RRF, varSelRF and LASSO logistic regression (with evaluations from an RF classifier). Also, RF applied to the features selected by RRF with the minimal regularization outperforms RF applied to all the features for most of the data sets considered here. Therefore, if accuracy is considered more important than the size of the feature subset, RRF with the minimal regularization may be considered. We use the accuracy performance of RF, a strong classifier, to evaluate feature selection methods, and illustrate that weak classifiers are less capable of capturing the information contained in a feature subset. Both RRF and GRRF were implemented in the ''RRF'' R package available at CRAN, the official R package archive.",2013,Pattern Recognit.
Adjusting the Penalized Term for the Regularized Regression Models,"More attention has been given to regularization methods in the last two decades as a result of exiting high-dimensional ill-posed data. This paper proposes a new method of introducing the penalized term in regularized regression. The proposed penalty is based on using the least squares estimatorâ€™s variances of the regression parameters. The proposed method is applied to some penalized estimators like ridge, lasso, and elastic net, which are used to overcome both the multicollinearity problem and selecting variables. Good results are obtained using the average mean squared error criterion (AMSE) for simulated data, also real data are shown best results in the form of less average prediction errors (APE) of the resulting estimators.

Tests in adaptive regression via the Kac-Rice formula,"We derive an exact p-value for testing a global null hypothesis in a general adaptive regression problem. The general approach uses the Kac-Rice formula, as described in (Adler & Taylor 2007). The resulting formula is exact in finite samples, requiring only Gaussianity of the errors. We apply the formula to the lasso, group lasso, and principal components and matrix completion problems. In the case of the lasso, the new test relates closely to the recently proposed covariance test of Lockhart et al. (2013).",2013,arXiv: Methodology
New Technologies And The Ethics Of Extreme Risks,"A transformative decision rule alters the representation of a decisionproblem, either by changing the sets of acts and states taken intoconsideration, or by modifying the probability or value assignments.Examples of decision rules belonging to this class are the principleof insufficient reason, Isaac Leviâ€™s condition of E-admissibility, Luceand Raiffaâ€™s merger of states-rule, and the de minimis principle. Inthis doctoral thesis transformative decision rules are analyzed froma foundational point of view, and applied to two decision theoreticalproblems: (i) How should a rational decision maker model a decisionproblem in a formal representation (â€˜problem specificationâ€™, â€˜formaldescriptionâ€™)? (ii) What role can transformative decision rules play inthe justification of the principle of maximizing expected utility?The thesis consists of a summary and seven papers. In Papers Iand II certain foundational issues concerning transformative decisionrules are investigated, and a number of formal properties of this classof rules are proved: convergence, iterativity, and permutability. InPaper III it is argued that there is in general no unique representationof a decision problem that is strictly better than all alternative representations.In Paper IV it is shown that the principle of maximizingexpected utility can be decomposed into a sequence of transformativedecision rules. A set of axioms is proposed that together justify theprinciple of maximizing expected utility. It is shown that the suggestedaxiomatization provides a resolution of Allaisâ€™ paradox that cannot beobtained by Savage-style, nor by von Neumann and Morgenstern-styleaxiomatizations. In Paper V the axiomatization from Paper IV is furtherelaborated, and compared to the axiomatizations proposed byvon Neumann and Morgenstern, and Savage. The main results in PaperVI are two impossibility theorems for catastrophe averse decisionrules, demonstrating that given a few reasonable desiderata for suchrules, there is no rule that can fulfill the proposed desiderata. In PaperVII transformative decision rules are applied to extreme risks, i.e.to a potential outcome of an act for which the probability is low, butwhose (negative) value is high.",2001,

Edwards Southwestern Oklahoma State University Abstract In our study, we found evidence for some effect on how students perceive information about systemic racism and White privilege based on the perceived identity of the presenter. â€¢ IntroductionIn our study, we found evidence for some effect on how students perceive information about systemic racism and White privilege based on the perceived identity of the presenter. â€¢ Introduction American audiences are continually presented with information regarding racially and gender driven discrimination. With inspiration drawn from the Battle, Hill, and Zorwick (SWPA2015) research, and contemporary cross-racial violence capturing the nationâ€™s attention, we were driven to examine the ideas young people had about White privilege and systematic racism as defined by Sue and Sue (2012). We wanted to know if our collective perception regarding this information is changed when the presenterâ€™s race, gender, or nationality changes. â€¢ Methods â€¢Participants -146 General Psychology students -69% female -66.4% European American -M ean Age of 19; Modal Age of 18 â€¢Materials -Materials for this study consisted of 8 short videos of students presenting information on White privilege and systemic racism, a demographic questionnaire, and a survey about the information. â€¢Procedures -Four studentstwo students of European decent (one male and one female) and two students of nonEuropean descent (again one male and one female) were filmed presenting scripted information. -E ach student filmed the script twice, once identifying themselves as American and once identifying themselves as an international student. -First, the participants were given a demographics questionnaire, then shown a video condition, and finally given a survey concerning how they felt about the filmâ€™s content and how it affected the world around them Results â€¢ Outcomes were explored based on presentersâ€™ racial identity, gender, and nationality. â€¢ There were no main effects or interactions for the presentersâ€™ concerns/issues; however, there were significant results for the other three outcome variables. â€¢ For the question of whether the presentation was informative, there was a significant main effect of the presentersâ€™ gender (F(1, 7)=8.88, p=.003). â€¢ For the question of whether the presenter changed the participantâ€™s view of race in society, there was a significant interaction between the presenterâ€™s race and gender (F(1,7)=5.50 p=02). â€¢ For the question of whether the presenter did a good job explaining the concept, there was a main effect of the presenterâ€™s race (F(1,7)=5.21, p=02).",2016,
Life is Story: Tales and Journeys in Practical Spirituality in the Aesthetic Plasma of Story in the Lila,"Life Is Story presents the aesthetic form of Story, in particular sacred story as opposed to secular story, as the true nonfictional prototype of all practical spirituality and inner transformation in the life journey of Persons headed toward human and meditative excellence. Story is further framed, like a story within a natural nest of many stories, in the paralleling and interpenetrating wider contexts of meditation following Patanjali and the civilization of high spirituality rooted in the Indian culture of Sanatana Dharma. The inner journey of Persons in service to the worlds unfolds alongside the constitutive elements of Story, illustrating the way ordinary lives may rise through inner reflection to the artistic richness of an integrated work of sacred living art exhibiting the canons and criteria of aesthetic oneness despite the tangle of events that distort, cover, distract, and beguile. The inner journey is aesthetically explored as the devices and magic of Story are decoded. An extraordinary and sacred adventure is revealed in a real aesthetic plasma, at once a display of a living storyfield of reciprocating karmas and a glistening but temporary maya of opportunities to find, hold, or lose the compassionate middle way between all pairs of opposites. Life Is Story explores the highest expression of sacred Story, the Parable, as a distinct nonfiction and the real calculus of life at a more exalted level than the fictional creativity of ordinary and secular stories. All Story nevertheless employs the same technical aesthetic devices to deliver up the noble poetry of humanitarian messages. â€˜Storyâ€™ in the singular intends a true Platonic Essence (Form) on par with the â€˜Paraâ€™ designation of Indian systems, something utterly beyond Nama-Rupa and the grasp of ordinary, even extraordinary, â€˜mindâ€™ and its discursive operations and affects. The descriptive adjective â€˜sacredâ€™ as opposed to merely secular reinforces this distinction. Ordinary â€˜storiesâ€™ are existential examples (existents), and may at that be either sacred or secular. The â€˜heartâ€™ of Story is higher than the top of the appearing hierarchical umbrella (well beyond the grasp of the physical, appearing, dazzling web of existential maya available to the five gross senses and the sixth subtle sensing organ of mind/manas). Story appeals to Soul (Atman) in the total economy of persons considered as body-mind-Spirit. Story, and Parable as high sacred Story, appeals to the Soulstate of persons. Ordinary, secular storiessacred miss the mark completely, or strike at the â€˜universalâ€™ level without recognition that the fullest frame and environment of Story, and of all its arsenal of devices, launches an appeal to the listening Soul where mindstuff has dissolved, never confusing high state mind with Soulstate. The large flaw of western metaphysics, psychology and cosmology is precisely the confusion of mindstate or mindstuff (citta-as-manas) with Soulstate (true meditation beyond mindstuff). This was at the top of my list of impediments to genuine east-west dialogue when I was invited to present and convene sessions at a world congress on Mysticism at Bangalore (at what is now Christ University), when the Dalai Llama was the keynote speaker. Failure to distinguish between high state Mind and Soul, which operates totally beyond Nama-Rupa, is the greatest failure and impediment to authentic east-west dialogue and communication. Words are used but meanings are missed, very completely, in philosophy and in the true phenomenology of consciousness. â€˜Storyâ€™ in the singular keeps the focus on what I will call â€˜Fourth Orderâ€™ psychologies of consciousness, based on Patanjaliâ€™s Yoga Psychology, rather than the Freudianism (1st order), Behaviorism (2nd order) and even the visionary Existential psychologies of a Sartre and a Merleau-Ponty (3rd order) in the west. Parable, however, moves beyond the humanitarian into the eternal and spiritual domain. One steps unawares and comfortably into sacred parabolic meanings poised on Infinity through the lassos, knots, and more of life under the spell and surge of Storyâ€™s meticulously embedded symbols and crescendo that flow through shift after shift of karmically and electrostatically charged storyfields and moments conspiring to restore sacred connections to the high spiritual culture and civilization of Sanatana Dharma, its Indian and closely allied spiritual and meditative cultures.",2018,

Previews NAD as a Genotype-Specific Drug Target,"Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia remains the paragon of genotype-targeted cancer pharmacology. The identification of ABL kinase activation by BCR-ABL fusion and the availability of STI-571 as an ABL-targeted inhibitor have allowed hundreds of thousands of US patients to be treated with a specific agent (Druker, 2008). Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL) that are refractory to treatment frequently contain chromosome translocations of the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene (de Boer et al., 2013; Muntean and Hess, 2012). The MLL gene encodes a histone H3 Lys 4 methyltransferase that is essential for HOX gene expression during development. Although mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) translocations result in loss of the endogenous methyltransferase domain, oncogenic MLL fusion proteins are associated with a set of transcriptional elongation promoting proteins and the histone H3 Lys79 methyltransferase DOT1L, which further enhance target gene expression (de Boer et al., 2013; Muntean and Hess, 2012). In addition, the N-terminal menin-binding motif of MLL and MLL fusions is essential for interactions with menin, the lens epithelium-derived growth factor, and chromatin and is required for leukemogenesis (Muntean and Hess, 2012). Thus, multiple MLLassociated factors are potential drug targets for MLL-rearranged ALL (de Boer et al., 2013; Muntean and Hess, 2012). Motivated by the severity of the malignancy and the wealth of potential drug targets, Matheny et al. (2013; in this issue of Chemistry & Biology) conducted a cellular high-throughput screen for lead compounds that would inhibit proliferation of MLL-rearranged ALL and possess little activity against ALL cell lines without MLL gene rearrangement. STF-118804 was identified in such screens. To identify the molecular target of this compound, they infected an MLL-rearranged cell line with pools of an 9,300 gene-targeting shRNA library, which contains 25 knockdown reagents per gene and identified the shRNAs that were depleted by selection with STF-118804. The data indicated that silencing of the nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase gene (NAMPT) produced hypersensitivity to the chemical probe (Matheny et al., 2013). NAMPT is the enzyme required for salvage biosynthesis from nicotinamide to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). Nicotinamide, like the other NAD precursor vitamins nicotinate and nicotinamide riboside, is a water soluble 3-pyridyl-containing metabolite. STF-11804 bears a strong resemblance to Nampt inhibitors FK866 and CB30865. All three are 3-pyridyl compounds with a hydrophobic extension (Figure 1). NAD and its reduced and phosphorylated forms, NADH, NADP, and NADPH, are essential for the function of multiple oxidoreductases in central carbon metabolism. This is termed the redox function of NAD. In addition, NAD is a consumed substrate of Sir2-related protein Lys deacetylases (sirtuins) and ADPribose-transfer enzymes including poly(ADPribose) polymerase (PARP). Nonredox functions of NAD are mediated by enzymes, such as sirtuins and PARP, that degrade the NAD dinucleotide to nicotinamide and ADPribosyl products, necessitating nicotinamide salvage in order to maintain NAD homeostasis (Belenky et al., 2007). NADH is so central to life that many common cell viability assays measure it as a proxy for proliferation.

Local Buckling of Stiffe ned and Unstiffe ned Elements under Nonuniform Compression,"Thin plates subjected to linearly varying inplane compression in one direction may undergo local buckling before failure. An analytical procedure is presented for evaluating the local buckling strength based on which equations for the local buckling stress of unstiffened and stiffened elements are presented. INTRODUCTION Thin walled members are composed of plate elements which are supported along both edges parallel to the direction of compression (referred to as stiffened elements) and supported along only one edge parallel to the direction of compression with the other completely free (referred to as unstiffened elements). These t~lin plate elements may experience elastic local buckling and stable postbuckling behaviour when subject to inplane compressive, bending or shear stress. Due to initial imperfections, the bifurcation type of local buckling indicated by small deflection theory is not usually experienced by elements of commercially manufactured thin walled members. However, the postbuckling behaviour expressed in the form of effective width equations is a function of the elastic local buckling stress and hence the theoretical calculation of elastic local buckling stress of thin walled elements is of practical interest. Furthermore, the out of plane deflection of imperfect plates increases drastically at local buckling stress and hence is of interest to deSigners. Stowell (1939). Timoshenko (1961), Winter (1959), and Kalyanaraman (1979), have presented methods for evaluating local buckling strength of thin plate elements and members subjected to uniform in plane compression. Rhodes and Harvey (1971) and Walker (1967), have presented analytical procedures for evaluating the local and postbuckling behaviour of t~lin walled stiffened and unstiffened elements subjected to linearly varying in plane compression. Ramakrishna and Kalyanaraman (1984) have presented closed form equations for local and post buckling strength of thin walled stiffened elements subjected to linearly varying inplane compression based on regression of analytical results. In this paper Galerkin's procedure has been used to solve the governing differential equation for calculating the Iqcal buckling stress of non-uniformly compressed stiffened and unstiffened elements having elastically rotationally restrained longitudinal edges. Through regression, equations developed [Jayabalan (1989)] for the local buckling coefficient are presented as a function of the edge rotational restraint factor, and the non-uniform compression factor. The results of the proposed equations are compared with experimental results.

Entwicklung von Photosensitizer-Konjugaten und Evaluierung im Caco-2 Modell,"Die Photosensitizer-gestutzte photodynamische Therapie stellt auf Grund ihrer hohen Selektivitat eine vielversprechende Behandlungsmethode in der Tumortherapie dar. Durch die gezielte Verabreichung von photosensibilisierenden Substanzen und deren anschliesender Aktivierung durch Bestrahlung mit Licht kann direkt an Tumorzellen ein zytotoxischer Effekt hervorgerufen werden. Jedoch ist der Erfolg der photodynamische Therapie durch ungunstige chemische, physikalische und pharmakologische Eigenschaften der meist lipophilen PS begrenzt. Um einige dieser limitierenden Faktoren zu uberwinden, konnten Photosensitizer mit wasserloslichen Polymeren oder cytoadhasiven Proteinen modifiziert werden, um Hydrophilie bzw. Zellinteraktion und damit die Effizienz zu erhohen. 
Im Rahmen dieser Arbeit wurden drei Photosensitizer aus der Gruppe der Porphyrine mit Polystyrolsulfat-Natrium (PSS-Na) oder Weizenlektin (WGA) modifiziert und die Interaktion dieser Konjugate mit Caco-2 Monolayern im Vergleich zur jeweiligen Ausgangsverbindung untersucht. WGA ist ein wasserlosliches Lektin, das durch seine spezifische Interaktion mit Zuckerstrukturen der Zellmembran die Bindung und auch Aufnahme von konjugierten Wirkstoffen in die Zelle verbessern kann. mTHPP wurde mit 13 Molekulen PSS-Na komplexiert (mTHPP-PSSNa), TPP wurde mittels mixed-anhydride-Methode und TCPP mittels Carbodiimid kovalent an WGA konjugiert. 
Die Modifikation von mTHPP mit PSS-Na bewirkte nach 30-minutiger Inkubation bei 4Â°C eine signifikant erhohte Bindung des Photosensitizers an die Zelloberflache, die quantitativ durch eine 30-fach hohere RFI bestatigt wurde. Dieses Ergebnis konnte zusatzlich bei 37Â°C nach 30 minutiger Inkubation mit einer bis zu 4-fach hoheren Zell-assoziierten relativen Fluoreszenzintensitat (RFI) im Vergleich zu mTHPP belegt werden. Eine Verlangerung der Inkubationsdauer bei 4Â°C und bei 37Â°C fuhrte bei beiden Verbindungen zu einem deutlichen Anstieg der RFI. Dabei zeigten sowohl mTHPP als auch mTHPP-PSSNa bei 37Â°C eine hohere zellassoziierte Fluoreszenzintensitat als bei 4Â°C, was auch auf eine Aufnahme der Photosensitizer in die Zellen hinweist. Diese quantitativen Ergebnisse konnten auch qualitativ durch Fluoreszenzmikroskopie bestatigt werden. Daruber hinaus fuhrte die Weislicht-Bestrahlung der mit PS beladenen Monolayer zu punktuellen Fluoreszenzverteilungen von mTHPP-PSSNa in den Zellen, welche aber nachweislich, gestutzt auf Kolokalisationsstudien mit Fluorescein-markiertem WGA, nicht durch Aufnahme in die Lysosomen zustande kommt. Des Weiteren konnte auch durch Visualisierung der Zellgrenzen mittels Farbung des tight junction Proteins ZO-1 weder fur mTHPP noch fur mTHPP-PSSNa eine eindeutige Aussage uber eine Aufnahme in die Zelle getroffen werden. 
 
Um die Wirkstoff â€“ Zellinteraktion zu verbessern wurde TPP mittels mixed anhydride-Methode an WGA gekoppelt. Die anschliesende Zell-Bindungsstudien der Konjugate bei 4Â°C ergaben keine Verbesserung der Bindungsrate durch die WGA-Modifikation. Aus diesem Grund wurden keine weiteren Versuche mit TPP durchgefuhrt. 
TCPP, das im Gegensatz zu TPP vier Carboxylgruppen besitzt, wurde durch die Carbodiimid-Methode in zwei unterschiedlich molaren Verhaltnissen (1:10 und 1:50, WGA:TCPP) an WGA gekoppelt. Die fluorimetrisch ausgewerteten Bindungsstudien bei 4Â°C erlaubten keine Aussage uber eine verbesserte Interaktion mit dem Zellmonolayer fur ein bestimmtes molares Ansatzverhaltnis. Als zusatzliche Kontrollen wurde einerseits eine Losung von TCPP in Puffer, andererseits ein moglicher ionischer Komplex mit Rinderserumalbumin eingesetzt, um die Zell-Bindungskapazitaten der beiden Konjugate naher charakterisieren zu konnen. Die geringfugig hoheren RFI-Werte der TCPP-WGA Konjugate im Vergleich zu TCCP-BSA weisen auf eine WGA-vermittelte Bindung an die Zelloberflache hin, daruber hinaus bewies die 1,5-fach hohere zellgebundene Fluoreszenzintensitat eine verbesserte Zell-Bindungskapazitat von TCPP-WGA-Konjugaten im Vergleich zum lipophilen TCPP. Durch Visualisierung der Zellbindung der TCPP-Konjugate durch Mikroskopie ergab, dass nur TCPP-WGA-3 an den Zellgrenzen angereichert wird, wahrend weder TCPP, TCPP-WGA-1 noch TCPP-BSA eine sichtbare Anlagerung zeigten. Nachdem eine Dunkeltoxizitat fur alle eingesetzten Probelosungen ausgeschlossen werden konnte, wurden die mit Photosensitizer behandelten Monolayer mit Weislicht bestrahlt und bei 37Â°C inkubiert. Nach 60 Minuten konnte durch mikroskopische Analyse fur TCPP-WGA-3 und nach 90 Minuten auch fur TCPP-WGA-1 ein zytotoxischer Effekt durch Abrundung und Ablosen der adharenten Caco-2 Zellen beobachtet werden, der zusatzlich durch Farben der Zellkerne toter Zellen bestatigt werden konnte. 
Insgesamt konnte in dieser Diplomarbeit gezeigt werden, dass die Effizienz von Photosensitizern durch zwei Parameter, einerseits eine gewisse minimale Hydrophilie zum Erreichen der Zellmembran in geloster Form, und andererseits eine gewisse minimale Lipophilie zur Anlagerung bzw. Aufnahme in die Zelle, bestimmt wird. Um dies zu erreichen, konnte die Komplexbildung mit einem hochmolekularen hydrophilen Molekul wie Polystyrolsulfat ausgenutzt werden. Um nicht nur die Hydrophilie, sondern auch die Anlagerung und Aufnahme des Photosensitizers in die Zelle zu erhohen, wurde dieser mit hochmolekularen, cytoinvasiven Lektinen modifiziert. Beide Konzepte konnten erstmals in Ihrer Funktionalitat bestatigt werden, jedoch sind noch viele und eingehendere Studien notwendig, bevor diese Photosensitizerkonjugate in der Therapie angewandt werden konnen.",2013,
