Estimating the trend in US real GDP using the â„“1 trend filtering,"ABSTRACTUsing non-Gaussian state-space models, Perron and Wada (2009, Journal of Monetary Economics, 56, 749â€“765) obtained a nearly piecewise linear trend estimate of US real gross domestic product such that its slope changed around 1973. Such a trend may be regarded as a result of occasional permanent shocks to the growth rate. This article shows that the trend filtering, which is quite similar to the Hodrickâ€“Prescott filtering and is a type of the recently popular lasso regression, yields almost the same trend estimate, and discusses the reason why this occurs.",2017,Applied Economics Letters
Predictive Modeling in Race Walking,This paper presents the use of linear and nonlinear multivariable models as tools to support training process of race walkers. These models are calculated using data collected from race walkers' training events and they are used to predict the result over a 3â€‰km race based on training loads. The material consists of 122 training plans for 21 athletes. In order to choose the best model leave-one-out cross-validation method is used. The main contribution of the paper is to propose the nonlinear modifications for linear models in order to achieve smaller prediction error. It is shown that the best model is a modified LASSO regression with quadratic terms in the nonlinear part. This model has the smallest prediction error and simplified structure by eliminating some of the predictors.,2015,Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience
Imputation of missing data via penalization techniques,"The aim of this master thesis is to give the user an estimate of uncertainty over missing data imputation. The full factorization approach is compared to the state-of-the-art approach of full conditional. The special feature in both algorithms is the penalization techniques. Both algorithms are used with different types of missing data like MAR, MCAR and NMAR. Simulated datasets were conducted with copulas. Simulations were varied in rate of missing observations, refitting times and the use, or not, of LASSO regression for last fit. Results are given in terms of accuracy of predicted values, pooled variance estimates and errors which occurred during programming and runtime. The full factorization approach showed advantages over full conditional especially if one looks on ratios of 10:1 observations to covariables. In cases were covariables were in higher numbers than observations, full conditional and full factorization nearly covered same results when ridge regression was used for all fits. Generally lasso regression did not improve accuracy of imputation results. This result can be generalized for all missing types used and simulations conducted in this master thesis. Imputed observations showed paths which are similar to MCMC bayesian statistics. The imputation steps alternated and converged to certain values. Results were stable when different datasets and seeds for random numbers were processed. Run time for both approaches was high due to errors that occurred in different R packages and functions which are costly in terms of CPU usage.",2015,
"Hospital-Based Back Surgery: Geospatial-Temporal, Explanatory, and Predictive Models","BACKGROUND
Hospital-based back surgery in the United States increased by 60% from January 2012 to December 2017, yet the supply of neurosurgeons remained relatively constant. During this time, adult obesity grew by 5%.


OBJECTIVE
This study aimed to evaluate the demand and associated costs for hospital-based back surgery by geolocation over time to evaluate provider practice variation. The study then leveraged hierarchical time series to generate tight demand forecasts on an unobserved test set. Finally, explanatory financial, technical, workload, geographical, and temporal factors as well as state-level obesity rates were investigated as predictors for the demand for hospital-based back surgery.


METHODS
Hospital data from January 2012 to December 2017 were used to generate geospatial-temporal maps and a video of the Current Procedural Terminology codes beginning with the digit 63 claims. Hierarchical time series modeling provided forecasts for each state, the census regions, and the nation for an unobserved test set and then again for the out-years of 2018 and 2019. Stepwise regression, lasso regression, ridge regression, elastic net, and gradient-boosted random forests were built on a training set and evaluated on a test set to evaluate variables important to explaining the demand for hospital-based back surgery.


RESULTS
Widespread, unexplained practice variation over time was seen using geographical information systems (GIS) multimedia mapping. Hierarchical time series provided accurate forecasts on a blind dataset and suggested a 6.52% (from 497,325 procedures in 2017 to 529,777 in 2018) growth of hospital-based back surgery in 2018 (529,777 and up to 13.00% by 2019 [from 497,325 procedures in 2017 to 563,023 procedures in 2019]). The increase in payments by 2019 are estimated to be US $323.9 million. Extreme gradient-boosted random forests beat constrained and unconstrained regression models on a 20% unobserved test set and suggested that obesity is one of the most important factors in explaining the increase in demand for hospital-based back surgery.


CONCLUSIONS
Practice variation and obesity are factors to consider when estimating demand for hospital-based back surgery. Federal, state, and local planners should evaluate demand-side and supply-side interventions for this emerging problem.",2019,Journal of Medical Internet Research
Using Machine Learning to Construct Nomograms for Patients with Metastatic Colon Cancer.,"AIM
Patients with synchronous colon cancer metastases have highly variable overall survival (OS), making accurate predictive models challenging to build. We aim to use machine learning to more accurately predict OS in these patients and to present this predictive model in the form of nomograms for patients and clinicians.


METHODS
Using the National Cancer Database (2010-2014), we identified right colon (RC) and left colon (LC) cancer patients with synchronous metastases. Each primary site was split into training and testing datasets. Nomograms predicting 3-year overall survival were created for each site using Cox proportional hazard regression with lasso regression. Each model was evaluated by both calibration (comparison of predicted versus observed overall survival) and validation (degree of concordance as measured by c-index) methodologies.


RESULTS
A total of 11,018 RC and 8,346 LC patients were used to construct and validate the nomograms. After stratifying each model into 5 risk groups, the predicted OS was within the 95% CI of the observed OS in 4 out of 5 risk groups for both the RC and LC models. Externally validated c-indexes at 3 years for RC and LC models were 0.794 and 0.761, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
Utilization of machine learning can result in more accurate predictive models for patients with metastatic colon cancer. Nomograms built from these models can assist clinicians and patients in the shared decision-making process of their cancer care.",2020,Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland
Robust learning of discriminative projection for multicategory classification on the Stiefel manifold,"Learning a robust projection with a small number of training samples is still a challenging problem in face recognition, especially when the unseen faces have extreme variation in pose, illumination, and facial expression. To address this problem, we propose a framework formulated under statistical learning theory that facilitates robust learning of a discriminative projection. Dimensionality reduction using the projection matrix is combined with a linear classifier in the regularized framework of lasso regression. The projection matrix in conjunction with the classifier parameters are then found by solving an optimization problem over the Stiefel manifold. The experimental results on standard face databases suggest that the proposed method outperforms some recent regularized techniques when the number of training samples is small.",2008,2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
Learning â„“1-penalized logistic regressions with smooth approximation,"The paper presents comparison of learning logistic regression model with different penalty terms. Main part of the paper concerns sparse regression, which includes absolute value function. This function is not strictly convex, thus common optimizers cannot be used directly. In the paper we show that in those cases smooth approximation of absolute value function can be effectively used either in the case of lasso regression or in fussed-lasso like case. One of examples focuses on two dimensional analogue of fussed-lasso model. The experimental results present the comparison of our implementations (in C++ and Python) on three benchmark datasets.",2017,2017 IEEE International Conference on INnovations in Intelligent SysTems and Applications (INISTA)
Employing Quantitative Systems Pharmacology to Characterize Differences in Igf1 and Insulin Signaling Pathways in Breast Cancer,"Insulin and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF1) have been shown to influence cancer risk and progression through poorly understood mechanisms. Here, new insights on the mechanisms of differential MAPK and Akt activation are revealed by an iterative quantitative systems pharmacology approach. In the first iteration, I combined proteomic screening with computational network inference to uncover differences in IGF1 and insulin induced signaling. Using reverse phase protein array of 21 breast cancer cell lines treated with a time course of IGF1 and insulin, I constructed directed protein expression networks using three separate methods: (i) lasso regression, (ii) conventional matrix inversion, and (iii) entropy maximization. These networks, named here as the time translation models, were analyzed and the inferred interactions were ranked by differential magnitude to identify pathway differences. The two top candidates, chosen for experimental validation, were shown to regulate IGF1/insulin induced phosphorylation events. Both of the knock-down perturbations caused phosphorylation responses stronger in IGF1 stimulated cells compared with insulin. Overall, the time-translation modeling coupled to wet-lab experiments has proven to be powerful in inferring differential interactions downstream of IGF1 and insulin signaling, in vitro. In the second iteration, mechanistic representation of IGF1 and insulin dual signaling cascades by a set of ODEs is generated by rule-based modeling. The mechanistic network modeling provided a framework to elucidate experimental targets downstream of two receptors, which were treated as indistinguishable in previous models. The model included cascades of both mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Akt signaling, as well as the crosstalk and feedback loops in between. The parameter perturbation scanning employed for seven different models of seven cell lines yielded new experimental hypotheses on how differential responses of MAPK and Akt originate. Complementary to the first iteration, the results in this part suggested that regulation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) is critical in inducing differential MAPK or Akt activation. Compensation and activating feedback mechanisms collectively depressed the efficacy of anti-IGF1R/InsR therapies. With the quantitative systems pharmacologic approach, the networks of signal transduction constructed in this thesis are aimed to discern novel downstream components of the IGF1R/InsR system, and to direct patients with suitable tumor subclasses to efficient personalized clinical interventions.",2018,
